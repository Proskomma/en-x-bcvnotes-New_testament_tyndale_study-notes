1:1	idm163385					 Ancient sermons often began with an introduction meant to grab the hearer’s attention and introduce the sermon’s main topics. In Hebrews, the first four verses form a single, eloquent Greek sentence built around the main clause, **God . . . has spoken**. Most English translations present these verses as several sentences for ease of reading.\n\n
1:1	idm163392					 **Long ago. . . . And now:** These verses deal with two time periods in which God has spoken, addressing the differences between the two eras in parallel fashion.\n\n
1:1	idm163399					 **Long ago** referred to the time before the Messiah’s coming. For the author of Hebrews, this primarily meant the Old Testament era. Throughout that past era, **God spoke many times and in many ways**—through dreams, visions, mighty acts, stories, commands, exhortations, angelic appearances, and appearances of God himself. • **The prophets** were all those through whom God gave his revelation (see *2 Pet 1:19-21*).\n\n
1:2	idm163409					 **These final days** refers to the historical era inaugurated at Christ’s coming (see *Isa 2:2*; *Acts 2:17*). Whereas the revelation of the Old Testament era came in a wide variety of forms over time, God’s ultimate revelation was given **through his Son***,* Jesus (see *Heb 2:3-4*). • **as an inheritance:** Christ is God’s royal heir; the author probably had *Ps 2:8* in mind.\n\n
1:3	idm163423					 The word translated **radiates***,* found only here in the New Testament, includes an idea of intense brightness. **God’s own glory** is the glorious manifestation of his presence (*Exod 16:7*; *33:18*; *Isa 40:5*). The Son’s glory is an expression of God’s glory—the Son of God manifests the person and presence of God (*Luke 9:32*; *John 1:14*; *2:11*; *17:5*; *Rom 8:17*). • The term translated **expresses***,* used only here in the New Testament, was used of a distinguishing mark imprinted on an object such as a coin. The Son gives a clear picture of **the very character of God** (*John 1:18*; *Phil 2:6*; *Col 1:15*). • **the mighty power of his command** (literally *his powerful word*): God’s word is the powerful, dynamic force that created and governs the world (*Heb 11:3*; *Ps 33:6-11*). Elsewhere the Son is called “the Word of God” (*Rev 19:13*; see also *John 1:1-18*). • **cleansed us from our sins:** See *Heb 9:11–10:18*. • **he sat down:** This clause is an allusion to *Ps 110:1* (see also *Heb 1:13*; *8:1*; *10:12*; *12:2*), which foretold the exaltation of Christ after his suffering (see *Matt 22:44*; *Acts 2:33*; *1 Cor 15:25*). **The right hand** of God indicates high honor, rank, and position (see *1 Kgs 2:19*; *Pss 16:11*; *45:4*, *9*; *80:17*).\n\n
1:4	idm163469					 The Son’s exalted position **shows that the Son is far greater than the angels** in status or rank. First-century Jews were fascinated with angels and held them in high esteem, so the author of Hebrews establishes the Son’s superiority to them. • **just as the name . . . is greater:** Cp. *2 Sam 7:8-14*. Some commentators believe that the title “Son” is the *name* implied here. Others think the name is *Yahweh,* the covenant name of God in the Old Testament (*Exod 3:14-15*; cp. *Phil 2:9-11*).\n\n
1:5	idm163482					 In these ten verses, the author uses a variety of Old Testament texts to show that Jesus is superior to the angels. Among ancient Jewish and Christian interpreters, Old Testament passages were strung together one after the other in “chain quotations” (called “pearl stringing”) to convince the hearers or readers of a certain theological point by presenting a lot of scriptural evidence together.\n\n
1:5	idm163488					 **God . . . said:** This verse quotes *Ps 2:7* and *2 Sam 7:14*. By exalting Jesus to his right hand (see *Acts 1:9-11*; *2:32-36*; *7:55-56*), the Father proclaimed his unique relationship with the Son. • **Today I have become your Father** (or *Today I reveal you as my Son*): Jesus did not *become* the Son at the exaltation—he had been involved in creation (*Heb 1:2*)—but the exaltation verified his identity to all.\n\n
1:6	idm163504					 The **supreme** (or *firstborn*) **Son** shared the authority of the father, inherited most of his property, and was especially favored. In the New Testament, “firstborn” most frequently refers to Christ’s supremacy both in the church and in the created order; his resurrection is often given as the evidence for this status (*Acts 13:33*; *Rom 1:4*; *8:29*; *Col 1:15*, *18*; *Rev 1:5*; cp. *Heb 12:23*, where believers are called firstborn children). • **“Let all of God’s angels worship him”:** This quotation from *Deut 32:43* demonstrates the lower status of the angels in that they worship the Son (see also *Ps 97:7*).\n\n
1:7	idm163523					 This verse quotes *Ps 104:4* to show that the angels are messengers or **servants** and, therefore, of a lesser rank than the Son, whom they serve. • In the Old Testament, **angels** are sometimes associated with **winds** and **fire** (see *Exod 3:2*; *Judg 6:21*; *13:16*, *20*; *2 Sam 22:11*; *Pss 18:10*; *35:5*), which is why angels are mentioned in connection with God’s lordship over nature.\n\n
1:8	idm163541					 These verses, quoting *Ps 45:6-7*, proclaim **the Son** as the divine, just, eternal, anointed King of the universe. • **to the Son he says:** Jesus is addressed as **God**; in *Heb 1:9*, **your God** is a reference to God the Father. • **pouring out the oil of joy:** Olive oil was used to anoint kings of Israel at the inauguration of their rule (*1 Sam 10:1*; *1 Kgs 19:15-16*). God **has anointed** his Son, Jesus Christ, as King.\n\n
1:10	idm163557					 These verses, quoting *Ps 102:25-27*, celebrate the Son as both the creator and the one who brings the created order to an end. All created things **will wear out like old clothing***,* and the Son will **discard them** (cp. *Heb 2:5*; *2 Pet 3:13*; *Rev 21:1*). By contrast, the Son of God **will live forever**.\n\n
1:13	idm163571					 In climactic fashion, the author ends his string of Old Testament quotations (see *study note on 1:5-14*) by quoting from *Ps 110:1* in celebration of Christ’s exaltation (see also study notes on *Luke 20:42-43*; *22:69*; *1 Cor 15:25*; *Eph 1:19-22*). • The image of the Son’s **enemies** as **a footstool under** his **feet** represents their absolute subjugation (see *Heb 2:8*). In the ancient world, a victorious king would place his foot on the neck or back of an enemy as a symbolic act of domination.\n\n
1:14	idm163587					 **Therefore, angels are only servants:** The author restates his conclusion. God sends out the angels **to care for** his people, **who will inherit salvation** at the end of the age (see *9:28*).\n\n
2:1	idm163597					 The author makes an argument from lesser to greater: If, in the lesser situation of the Old Testament era, people who rejected God’s word as delivered by angels were severely punished, how much greater the punishment will be for those who now reject the word of salvation that has been delivered by the Son himself and confirmed by the Holy Spirit.\n\n
2:1	idm163603					 **The truth we have heard** is the message of salvation delivered through Christ (*2:3*). • **Drift away** pictures a ship getting off course. Here it speaks of getting off track spiritually due to not listening **very carefully** to the Good News.\n\n
2:2	idm163613					 According to Jewish tradition, **the message God delivered, **the law given on Mount Sinai (see *Acts 7:38*; *Gal 3:19*), was delivered **through angels**. • **Violation of the law** was punished (see *Exod 22:19*; *Lev 20:10*; *Num 35:16-21*), and punishment was inescapable (*Prov 1:24-31*; *Jer 11:11*).\n\n
2:3	idm163629					 **So what makes us think we can escape?** Here the author presses the full force of the danger of turning away from Christ and his salvation. There is no escape from punishment for those who walk away, and the punishment will be of the greatest severity (cp. *6:4-12*; *10:26-31*; *12:29*; *Rom 2:5*; *1 Thes 2:16*). • **Salvation** refers to God’s acts on behalf of his people. For example, God saved his people through the exodus from Egypt (*Deut 26:5-9*). In the New Testament, salvation primarily refers to Christ’s work of rescuing people from the penalty of sin and giving them new life by his sacrificial death on the cross (*Heb 5:9-10*). This salvation was **first announced by the Lord Jesus himself** (e.g., *Matt 4:17*; *9:35*; *Mark 1:15*; *Luke 13:1-5*). He **then delivered** (or *validated*) the message through **those who heard him speak** (e.g., *Mark 6:12*; *Acts 2:38*; *3:19-20*).\n\n
2:4	idm163655					 **God confirmed the message** (literally *God bore witness*): God himself confirmed the validity of the message of Christ and his followers **by giving signs and wonders and various miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit** (see *Acts 2:22*; *Rom 15:19*; *2 Cor 12:12*).\n\n
2:5	idm163667					 The author of Hebrews uses *Ps 8:4-6* to transition from the discussion of Christ’s exalted divinity (*Heb 1:5-14*) to the discussion of his humanity (*2:10-18*). *Psalm 8* is often presented with *Ps 110:1* (see *Heb 1:13*) to speak of the submission of created things to Christ (see *1 Cor 15:25-27*; *Eph 1:20-23*). Christ is the consummate human being. In his exaltation, he fulfills what fallen humanity could not: true dominion over the created order.\n\n
2:5	idm163681					 **it is not angels:** Cp. *1:13*.\n\n
2:6	idm163689					 These verses quote *Ps 8:4-6*. *Psalm 8* speaks of the position God has given humanity, but the author of Hebrews applies it as a prediction about Christ, who is the fulfillment and representative head of humanity.\n\n
2:6	idm163697					 **What are mere mortals:** These two lines of the psalm proclaim God’s special attention to human beings. • **a son of man** (or *the Son of Man*): The phrase *son of man* speaks of human existence; it parallels *mere mortals* in the previous line. In the Gospels Jesus frequently referred to himself with this phrase.\n\n
2:7	idm163708					 **them:** Literally *him.* This refers to humanity in general and is applied specifically to Christ (see *study note on 2:6-8*). • Christ became **a little lower than the angels** (or *lower than the angels for only a little while*), like other human beings (see also *Phil 2:5-8*). As a result of his suffering, he was **crowned** . . . **with glory and honor** (see *Heb 2:9*; *Phil 2:9-11*).\n\n
2:8	idm163724					 **You gave them authority over all things** (literally *You have put all things under his feet*): See *study note on 2:6-8*. • **nothing is left out:** All things are ultimately subject to Christ and the church, but **we have not yet seen** the complete expression of this reality—it will be consummated at the end of the age.\n\n
2:9	idm163735					 **What we do see is Jesus:** How can the church persevere when evil and death are still in the world? We look to Jesus both in his human life in **a position “a little lower than the angels”** and in his exaltation, **now “crowned with glory and honor.”** His suffering as a human being led to his exaltation (see *Phil 2:5-11*; cp. *Isa 52:13–53:12*). See also *Heb 12:1-13*.\n\n
2:10	idm163747					 At least four reasons why the Son of God became human are implied in this passage. First, **it was only right:** It is consistent with what we know of God’s character that he would accomplish salvation in this way (*2:10*). Second, Jesus had to become **human** to die (*2:14*). Third, high priests, as detailed in the Old Testament law, had to come from among God’s **people** (*2:17*). Fourth, Jesus became a sympathetic priest, experiencing the **suffering and testing** we know as humans (*2:18*).\n\n
2:10	idm163761					 **children** (literally *sons*): The author plays off his use of the title *Son* for Jesus throughout the section, here referring to the people of God as *sons.* The translation *children* makes it clear that this term refers to all God’s people, male and female. • The term translated **leader** had a wide range of meanings in the ancient world, including *founder,* *hero,* *champion, prince, captain, leader,* or *scout.* Jesus is a leader in that he blazed a trail for those who are saved, leading them to glory.\n\n
2:11	idm163777					 **have the same Father** (literally *are all out of one*): Based on the family terminology in the context, the phrase can be understood as referring to God. However, the author might have been thinking of Abraham as a common ancestor (see *2:16*) or of human nature as a common experience (*out of one nature*). • **brothers and sisters:** Greek adelphoi, a generic term that refers to members of the same family, both male and female.\n\n
2:12	idm163789					 This verse quotes *Ps 22:22*, commenting on the phrase **brothers and sisters** in *Heb 2:11*. *Psalm 22* contains profound messianic prophecies concerning the sufferings of Christ (*Ps 22:1*, *7-8*, *16-18*; see *Matt 27:35*, *43*; *John 19:23-24*, *31-36*). *Psalm 22:22* shows the solidarity of the righteous sufferer (Jesus) with the people of God in praising God for his help.\n\n
2:13	idm163807					 This verse quotes *Isa 8:17-18*, which comes from a broader messianic context (cp. *Isa 8:14* with *Rom 9:33*; *1 Pet 2:8*). • **I will put my trust in him** here declares Jesus’ trust in the Father. • **I and the children God has given me** indicates a close relationship between Jesus and the children of God.\n\n
2:14	idm163819					 The death of **the Son** of God as a sacrifice for sin served to **break the power of the devil:** It made the devil’s **power of death** ineffective (*1 Cor 15:56*). • Philo, a first-century Jewish philosopher, wrote that “nothing is so calculated to enslave the mind as fearing death” (Philo, *That Every Good Person Is Free* 3.22). Through his sacrificial death, Christ set free those who were **slaves to the fear of dying**.\n\n
2:16	idm163831					 **descendants of Abraham:** Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross was for the heirs of God’s promises to Abraham, rather than for the **angels**.\n\n
2:17	idm163839					 These verses introduce Jesus’ role as **our merciful and faithful High Priest***,* which is fully discussed in the central section of Hebrews (*4:14–10:25*). • **It was necessary for him** to share our humanity (see *5:1*).\n\n
3:1	idm163850					 The author compares Jesus to Moses, setting Jesus forward as the supreme example of faithfulness. The great status of Moses, a revered figure in Judaism, is used to show the incomparable greatness of Jesus.\n\n
3:1	idm163856					 **dear brothers and sisters who belong to God:** Literally *holy brothers.* Speakers and writers of the ancient world often addressed religious gatherings as “brothers” (Greek adelphoi), referring to both men and women. • **think carefully about this Jesus:** Focusing on Jesus is a primary means of persevering in the faith (*2:9*; *12:1-2*). • **God’s messenger** (literally *God’s apostle*): This description might be highlighting the Son’s role in bearing a proclamation of God’s name and message (*2:12*; *Matt 10:40*; *Mark 9:37*; *Luke 10:16*).\n\n
3:2	idm163874					 Jesus **was faithful to God** and to the task to which the Father had appointed him (*5:7-10*; *12:1-3*; *Phil 2:5-11*), **just as Moses** had been (*Num 12:7*). Many Jews of the first century regarded Moses as the greatest person in history, of even higher status than the angels.\n\n
3:3	idm163886					 **Jesus deserves far more glory** for two reasons. First, **a person who builds a house deserves more praise than the house itself**. The Messiah is the one who builds God’s house (see *2 Sam 7:13*). The implication is that Moses is part of the house (i.e., God’s people) that God has built. Second, whereas Moses was **a servant** in God’s house, **Christ, as the Son,** is the heir **in charge of God’s entire house**. Sons have greater status than household servants.\n\n
3:6	idm163898					 We are part of Christ’s house **if we keep our courage**. The author could not give unqualified assurance to those who were drifting away from Christ and the church. Those who persevere in the faith have assurance that they are part of God’s house (see *3:14*; *Rom 8:9*, *17*; *11:22*; *2 Cor 13:5*; *Col 1:22-23*).\n\n
3:7	idm163911					 This passage presents, “as a warning to us” (*1 Cor 10:6*), the  negative example of those who wandered in the wilderness for forty years and died there. The wilderness wanderings represent disobedience to God and its consequences (see *Num 32:7-11*; *Deut 1:19-35*; *Ps 106:24-26*).\n\n
3:8	idm163921					 **Israel** . . . **rebelled** and **tested** God in places such as Massah and Meribah, where there was a shortage of water (*Exod 17:1-7*; *Num 20:2-13*), and especially at Kadesh, where the disobedient Israelites refused to enter the Promised Land (*Heb 3:10*; see *Num 14:1-25*; *Deut 1:19-46*; *Ps 106*).\n\n
3:9	idm163936					 Despite seeing the **miracles** God had performed on their behalf, the people of Israel **tested** God’s **patience** by refusing to trust him in the wilderness (*Num 14:11*, *22*). The essence of their rebellion was that **their hearts always** turned **away** from God—they did not desire to obey him. The result was that God **was angry with them**.\n\n
3:11	idm163950					 Rebellion has consequences. • God’s **anger** is not merely an emotional reaction; it is his just displeasure toward sin (*John 3:36*; *Rom 1:18*; *1 Thes 2:16*). • God’s **oath** (see *Heb 6:13-20*; *7:20-22*, *28*) was that they would **never enter** Canaan, the **place of rest** from their wanderings (*Deut 1:19-46*; *3:20*; *12:10*; *Josh 1:13*).\n\n
3:12	idm163970					 The author of Hebrews discusses the terms *heart, day, today, hear, enter, rest, unbelief,* and *oath,* all drawn from *Ps 95*. Bible teachers of the ancient world would cite and then explain an Old Testament text, often highlighting significant words from the text, just as preachers do today. This form of exposition was called *midrash.*\n\n
3:12	idm163980					 **hearts . . . not evil and unbelieving:** An evil heart stubbornly sets its will against the Lord due to unbelief, causing a person to turn **away from the living God**.\n\n
3:13	idm163988					 Using the word **“today”** from *Ps 95:7*, the author challenges his hearers to **warn each other every day** against the deceptive and hardening power of **sin**.\n\n
3:14	idm163998					 **For if we are faithful:** Those who persevere in the faith have assurance that they are indeed part of God’s family (see *3:6*; *Rom 8:9*, *17*; *11:22*; *2 Cor 13:5*; *Col 1:22-23*).\n\n
3:15	idm164011					 This verse again quotes *Ps 95:7-8*, the exhortation from that portion of the psalm. It sums up the author’s own exhortation in *Heb 3:12-14*, focusing on the importance of listening and responding favorably to God’s **voice**.\n\n
3:16	idm164020					 These verses contain a rapid-fire series of questions and answers, a common rhetorical technique. The three questions follow the progression of ideas found in *Ps 95:8-11*: The people of Israel rebelled against God, God was angry, and God took an oath that they would never enter his rest. The answers are taken from other Old Testament passages that focus on the Israelites’ rebellion in the wilderness (*Num 14*; *Deut 9*; *Ps 106*). The author drives home the terrible cost of disobedience to God.\n\n
3:19	idm164030					 **Unbelief** and disobedience are closely associated in Hebrews and in the Old Testament passages being discussed (*Num 14:11*; *Deut 9:23*; *Ps 78:22*, *32*). As a consequence of disobedience, **they were not able to enter his rest** by entering the land of Canaan (*Deut 3:20*; *12:10*; *Josh 1:13*).\n\n
4:1	idm164045					 The author transitions to the **promise** that the faithful will enter God’s **rest** and exhorts his listeners to take this promise seriously. Hearing is not enough: It must be combined with **faith**.\n\n
4:1	idm164054					 To **fear** God means to experience an appropriate reverence, even awe, for God and his will. It would be the worst of tragedies to **fail to experience** what God has promised.\n\n
4:2	idm164062					 **This good news** is the message of salvation (*2:3-4*). • **they didn’t share the faith of those who listened to God:** Some manuscripts read *they didn’t combine what they heard with faith.* In either case, the hearers were deficient in faith, distrusting God’s word of promise.\n\n
4:3	idm164072					 People **who believe** the Good News are the true heirs of God’s **rest***,* the salvation that God offers through Christ’s sacrifice. • **God said:** The quotation of *Ps 95:11* reminds the reader that the unbelieving rebels in the wilderness would **never enter** God’s **place of rest** (cp. *Heb 11:8*, *10*, *14-16*; *12:22-24*). • **since he made the world:** God’s rest means much more than physical entry into Canaan (see *study note on 4:4*).\n\n
4:4	idm164091					 This verse quotes *Gen 2:2* to demonstrate that the promised rest was established when **God rested** at creation.\n\n
4:5	idm164099					 This quotation of *Ps 95:11* reiterates the point made in *Heb 4:3*.\n\n
4:6	idm164107					 **So God’s rest is there:** Building on the discussion in *4:3-5*, the author is about to argue that the promised **rest** is still available (*4:7-10*). But those who wandered in the wilderness, even though they **heard** the **good news** that the Promised Land was open to them, **failed to enter because they disobeyed God** (see *Num 14:1-25*; *Deut 1:19-46*; *Ps 106*).\n\n
4:7	idm164123					 **So God set another time . . . and that time is today:** The logic here is that **David** wrote *Ps 95* **much later** than the wilderness debacle, so God’s **rest** cannot be limited to that earlier generation. The **words already quoted** are from *Ps 95:7-8*; these words encourage us not to **harden** our **hearts** when hearing God’s **voice** so that we might enter the rest that the people in the wilderness were denied. This opportunity is available **today** (see *Heb 3:13*).\n\n
4:8	idm164141					 **Joshua** is the same name as *Jesus* (Greek *Iēsous,* Hebrew* Yehoshua‘*). It is normally translated *Joshua* in the Old Testament and *Jesus* in the New Testament (see also *study note on Exod 17:9*). The author is making a word play on Jesus’ and Joshua’s shared name. Joshua did lead God’s people into the Promised Land (*Josh 3–4*), but God had more in mind when he promised his people **rest**. God’s ultimate rest is provided by Jesus (*Heb 3:13-14*; *4:3*, *9-11*, *14-16*).\n\n
4:9	idm164160					 **a special rest:** Jesus’ sacrifice functioned as a Day of Atonement sacrifice (*5:1-3*; *9:13-22*; see *Lev 23:26-28*, *32*). Through Christ’s sacrifice, God’s promised rest for his people is available.\n\n
4:10	idm164171					 **have rested from their labors:** See *Exod 20:8-11*. • **just as God did:** *Gen 2:2*.\n\n
4:11	idm164181					 **let us do our best to enter:** Failure to respond to the Good News with active obedience to God’s voice (*4:1-2*) will have an outcome analogous to the outcome for the wilderness wanderers: **we will fall**. • **us . . . we . . . we:** Obedience is not simply a personal matter; God’s people have a communal responsibility for obedience and should support each other in that endeavor (cp. *3:13*; *10:25*; *12:15*).\n\n
4:12	idm164194					 Echoing the call to hear God’s voice (*3:7*, *15*; *4:7*; quoted from *Ps 95:7*), the author gives a beautiful epigram on the power and penetration of God’s **word**. • **alive and powerful:** God’s word is an active, effective force. The word that created and governs the cosmos (*Heb 1:2-3*) can deal powerfully with people. • **the sharpest two-edged sword:** God’s word is able to penetrate the darkest recesses of people’s lives, exposing their **innermost thoughts and desires** (cp. *Eph 6:17*; *Rev 1:16*; *2:12*, *16*; *19:15*).\n\n
4:13	idm164214					 To be **naked and exposed** speaks figuratively of being vulnerable, helpless, or unprotected. The guilty are not able to hide from God’s penetrating word of judgment (cp. *Rev 3:17*).\n\n
4:14	idm164222					 These key verses conclude the exhortation begun at *3:1* and introduce the lengthy treatment of Jesus’ role as High Priest (*4:14–10:25*).\n\n
4:14	idm164230					 This verse effectively summarizes the whole message and challenge of Hebrews; the high priesthood of **Jesus the Son of God** is the basis for endurance in the Christian faith. • **a great High Priest:** Israel’s high priest was the main leader in the worship of God and the primary mediator between God and the people (see *Exod 31:10*; *Lev 4:3*; *2 Kgs 12:10*; *2 Chr 26:20*). • **who has entered heaven:** The earthly high priests entered God’s presence in the Most Holy Place once a year on the Day of Atonement (*Lev 16:1-25*). By contrast, Jesus, our High Priest, has entered God’s presence in heaven, and there he remains (*Heb 7:26*; *9:11-12*, *23-26*). • **let us hold firmly:** An enduring commitment to active belief in and allegiance to Jesus (see also *Col 2:19*; *2 Thes 2:15*; *Rev 2:13*, *25*; *3:11*).\n\n
4:15	idm164253					 Our High Priest **understands our weaknesses***,* our human pull toward sin, because **he faced all of the same testings we do**. He was tempted with all the essential aspects of sin, such as lust, greed, unforgiveness, and dishonesty. This makes him compassionate as our High Priest (*5:2*). • **yet he did not sin:** Jesus is unlike the earthly high priests, who had to make offerings for their own sins before they could make offerings for the people (*5:3*; *7:26-28*; see also *1 Pet 2:22-23*).\n\n
4:16	idm164267					 The verb translated **let us come** could be translated to indicate ongoing action: *let us continually come.* • As our compassionate High Priest, Jesus has opened the way for people to enter God’s presence **boldly** (see *6:19-20*; *10:19-23*), where we can obtain his **mercy** and **grace to help us when we need it most**.\n\n
5:1	idm164280					 This section addresses the appointment of the Son of God as a superior High Priest. The focal text is *Ps 110:4*, which reveals God’s oath that the Son would be a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.\n\n
5:1	idm164287					 **Every high priest:** This phrase introduces requirements for high priests in general. • **a man:** The high priest was one of the people, so Jesus had to become human (see *2:17-18*). • A second requirement for high priests was that they would **represent other people** by offering **sacrifices** on their behalf (*7:25-28*). Only the high priest could offer the sacrifice on the Day of Atonement (*Exod 29*; *Lev 16:1-25*).\n\n
5:2	idm164301					 A high priest was **able to deal gently** with those who sin because **he himself** was **subject to the same weaknesses***,* i.e., he was sinful (*5:3*; cp. *4:15*).\n\n
5:3	idm164313					 On the Day of Atonement the high priest was required to **offer sacrifices** for himself and his household prior to offering sacrifices for the people (*Lev 16:11*).\n\n
5:4	idm164321					 The role of **high priest** is by God’s appointment rather than human enlistment (see *Exod 28:1*; *Lev 8:1-12*; *Num 16:1-26*).\n\n
5:5	idm164331					 The author brings *Pss 2:7* and *110:4* together based on shared language—both passages have **God** speaking to his **Son**. The exalted Son, who came to earth as a human (*Heb 1–2*), is the one God has appointed to a unique high priesthood.\n\n
5:7	idm164342					 Jesus’ suffering was a foundation for his superior priesthood. The Son’s humiliation and suffering preceded his exaltation (*2:9*; *Phil 2:5-11*).\n\n
5:7	idm164350					 The phrase **with a loud cry and tears** is probably an allusion to Christ’s suffering in the Garden (see *Matt 26:36-46*; *Mark 14:32-42*; *Luke 22:40-46*). **God heard his prayers** in the sense of affirming his righteousness and suitability for his role as high priest. Jesus’ faithful devotion is being presented as an example for the readers (cp. *Heb 12:2-3*).\n\n
5:8	idm164362					 **he learned obedience from the things he suffered:** Jesus was not disobedient before his suffering, but he walked his path of human experience—all the way to his death on the cross—in complete submission to the Father’s will. We are expected to travel the same path (*12:1-11*).\n\n
5:9	idm164370					 **God qualified him as a perfect High Priest:** As used in Hebrews, *perfect* means “complete” or “mature” (see *2:10*; *5:14*; *7:11*; *9:9-11*). Jesus, through his sufferings, was qualified to be **the source of eternal salvation for all those who obey him**. • *High Priest* is not in the Greek text, but it is implied. • As the Son obeyed the Father (*5:8*), submitting completely to the Father’s will, so those who come to him for *salvation* must *obey him.*\n\n
5:10	idm164387					 **a High Priest in the order of Melchizedek:** See *7:1-28*.\n\n
5:11	idm164395					 After beginning to discuss Jesus’ appointment as High Priest (*5:1-10*), the author confronts his audience with a series of exhortations (*5:11–6:20*). Such a shift in a sermon or discourse was meant to focus the hearers’ attention.\n\n
5:11	idm164403					 This exhortation deals with the recipients’ spiritual lethargy.\n\n
5:11	idm164409					 **spiritually dull:** The Greek term means “sluggish, dimwitted, negligent, lazy.”\n\n
5:12	idm164416					 Their lack of spiritual vitality was especially shocking since they had been **believers so long:** They ought to have been spiritual leaders who were **teaching others** from their wealth of knowledge and Christian experience. • **the basic things:** The most rudimentary aspects of the Christian faith (see *6:1-3*). • The imagery of **milk** and **solid food** (or *meat*) was used to distinguish basic from advanced education, and immature from mature students.\n\n
5:14	idm164429					 Being able **to recognize the difference between right and wrong** is a defining characteristic of spiritual maturity.\n\n
6:1	idm164436					 In light of the hearers’ immaturity (*5:11-14*), the author urges them to move beyond **basic teachings**. The six basic teachings here were all foundational elements of Jewish instruction. The author might be challenging them to move beyond these basic teachings to **further understanding** about the person of Christ, which he elaborates in *7:1–10:25*.\n\n
6:1	idm164446					 **Let us go on:** Or *Let us be carried on,* suggesting that God initiates growth to maturity (*Phil 2:12-13*) and that it is an ongoing process. • **Repenting** and **faith** are the basic commitments that initiate a person to the new covenant and constitute the basic posture of a Christian’s life (see *Acts 20:21*).\n\n
6:2	idm164458					 The term **baptisms** (or *washings*) is plural, so it must mean more than just Christian baptism. Instruction about various washings was prevalent in first-century Judaism (see *Matt 15:2*; *Mark 7:3*). The author might also have in mind the cleansing rituals of the Old Testament (cp. *Heb 9:13*; *10:22*). • The **laying on of hands** was associated with healing (*Mark 5:22-23*; *Luke 13:13*), ritual blessing (*Matt 19:13*, *15*), reception of the Holy Spirit (*Acts 8:17*; *9:17*; *19:6*), and acknowledgement of a person’s ministry (*Acts 6:6*; *13:3*). • **resurrection of the dead:** See “*The Resurrection of the Dead*” Theme Note. • **eternal judgment:** See *Rev 20:11-15*.\n\n
6:3	idm164484					 The author is implicitly exhorting his readers to maturity, not only in their **understanding** but in everything (cp. *4:11*; *5:14*; *10:23-39*; *12:1-13*).\n\n
6:4	idm164495					 This passage, one of the most difficult in the New Testament, gives a harsh warning about those who have left the Christian faith. Those who have fallen away from Christ and the church are like those who fell in the wilderness (*3:15-19*): The lack of faith shown in such apostasy results in devastating judgment (cp. *10:26-31*).\n\n
6:4	idm164503					 In Greek, the word **impossible** begins the sentence for emphasis—it absolutely cannot happen (see also *6:18*; *10:4*; *11:6*). • They were **once enlightened** when they “first learned about Christ” (see *10:32* and *corresponding study note*). • The **good things of heaven** might allude to the manna given from heaven (*Exod 16:4*, *15*; *Ps 78:24*) as an image of spiritual blessings.\n\n
6:5	idm164520					 **tasted the goodness of the word of God:** These people had heard the word of God preached (*2:3-4*; *4:1-2*) and had seen its effects. • **the power of the age to come:** They had witnessed signs and wonders when they heard the Good News (*2:4*; cp. *Exod 7:3-4*; *Deut 7:19*; *Pss 66:3*; *77:15-20*; *78:9-16*; *1 Cor 10:1-13*).\n\n
6:6	idm164537					 **then turn** (or *fall*) **away:** The image is reminiscent of the wilderness wanderers who turned away from obeying God and fell in the desert (*3:17*; *4:11*; *Num 14:1-4*, *29-30*). • **to bring such people back to repentance:** They had repented before, but had no fruit from their repentance (*Heb 6:7-8*). When people turn their back on Christ and his superior sacrifice, **it is impossible** for them to find any other means of repentance. • **Rejecting the Son of God** constitutes **nailing him to the cross once again**. Crucifixion was the ultimate instrument of rejection and humiliation in the Greco-Roman world and brought **public shame**. Those who turned away from Christ had in effect joined those who stood before the cross shouting insults, insisting that Jesus was not really the Messiah and Son of God but was instead worthy of shame (see *Matt 27:39-44*).\n\n
6:7	idm164557					 **ground:** Good, productive land is an image of blessing, contrasted with the curse of unproductive land that **bears thorns and thistles**. To **burn** such a field is an image of judgment (*2 Sam 23:4-7*; *Isa 10:17*; *33:12*; *Ezek 19:12-13*; *Matt 3:10*).\n\n
6:9	idm164571					 Having confronted his readers with a stern warning (*6:4-8*), the author now softens that warning by greeting them as **dear friends***,* expressing confidence in them, and giving them further encouragement.\n\n
6:9	idm164580					 **We are confident:** Skilled speakers and writers express confidence in those they address to motivate them (cp. *Rom 15:14*). • The author is confident that his hearers’ lives give evidence of a true relationship with God, including **salvation**. In the New Testament, salvation primarily refers to Christ’s work on the cross (*Heb 5:9-10*; see also *study note on 2:3*); Hebrews places emphasis on the consummation of salvation at the end of the age (*9:28*).\n\n
6:10	idm164592					 **He will not forget how hard you have worked:** In showing that they love God and his people, their works bear witness to their true relationship with God (*Rom 2:6-7*; *1 Cor 3:13-15*; *Jas 2:14-20*). God remembers (*Exod 2:24*; *1 Chr 16:15*; *Ps 106:45*) and acknowledges those who are truly his.\n\n
6:11	idm164605					 **keep on loving others** (literally *show the same eager commitment*): Love of other believers is a hallmark of genuine Christian faith (*Jas 2:15-16*; *1 Jn 3:16-20*). Through diligence and focused commitment, they can **make** their **hope** in Christ absolutely **certain**. Assurance of salvation comes through perseverance.\n\n
6:12	idm164618					 A focused commitment (*6:10-11*) is the antidote to being **spiritually dull** (*5:11-12*). By loving God and others, we **follow the example** of great people of the faith. The author puts a great deal of emphasis on both **faith and endurance** as normal requirements for God’s people (see *11:4-38*).\n\n
6:13	idm164630					 This passage focuses on the reliability of God’s faithfulness to his promises. The theme of God’s oath is developed with an illustration (*6:13-15*), followed by a general principle (*6:16*), followed by the main point: God has sworn a significant oath (*6:17-18*), which gives us hope because it shows that Jesus is our permanent High Priest (*6:19-20*).\n\n
6:13	idm164640					 **Abraham** was the premier exemplar of faith: He continued to believe that God would give him a son, then was willing to sacrifice that son in obedience to God (*11:17-19*; *Gen 15:1-5*; *22:1-14*). In response to Abraham’s faith, **God took an oath,** assuring Abraham that he would **bless** him and **multiply** his **descendants**.\n\n
6:15	idm164654					 **what God had promised:** Through Isaac, God made Abraham into a great nation (*Exod 1:7*).\n\n
6:16	idm164662					 It is a general principle in human relationships that when **people take an oath***,* the **oath is binding**. If in human contexts oaths give assurance that something is true, an oath from God ought to inspire much greater confidence (*6:17-19*). • **someone greater than themselves:** Cp. *6:13*.\n\n
6:17	idm164674					 **God also bound himself with an oath:** See *7:20-22*. God’s oath makes it clear that **he would never change his mind** . . . **because it is impossible for God to lie** (see *Ps 110:4*). • We have **fled to him for refuge***,* like those in the Old Testament era who killed someone accidentally (*Num 35:9-34*; *Deut 4:41-43*); Christ is like a city of refuge, where believers escape God’s wrath. Christ’s followers, therefore, have **great confidence**.\n\n
6:19	idm164690					 Christian **hope is a strong and trustworthy anchor for our souls**. In the first century, an anchor was an image of stability and safety. • **through the curtain:** A curtain separated the outer room of the sanctuary, into which only priests could go, from the inner room, the Most Holy Place (*Exod 25:10-40*). Only the high priest could go into the Most Holy Place, and only once per year on the Day of Atonement (*Exod 29*; *Lev 16:1-25*). Because of Jesus’ extraordinary high priesthood, he **has already gone in there for us** into the presence of God as **our eternal High Priest***,* and he leads us in with him (*Heb 10:19-23*). • **the order of Melchizedek:** This phrase introduces the discussion in *7:1-28*.\n\n
7:1	idm164707					 *Hebrews 7* develops the main topic introduced in *5:1-10*: Jesus’ appointment as a high priest in the order of Melchizedek.\n\n
7:1	idm164715					 This section proclaims the superiority of Melchizedek’s priesthood over that of the Levites, based primarily on *Gen 14:17-20*.\n\n
7:1	idm164722					 **king of . . . Salem:** See *Gen 14:18* and *corresponding study note*. • **also a priest of God Most High:** Unlike the Hebrew kings, Melchizedek combined the offices of king and priest, thus foreshadowing the Messiah. • **winning a great battle against the kings:** See *Gen 14:1-17*.\n\n
7:2	idm164734					 Abraham was giving **a tenth** to the Lord by giving it to **Melchizedek***,* his priest. This act anticipates the giving of tithes under the law (*Lev 27:30*, *32*) and becomes a key point in the author’s argument (*Heb 7:4*). • **Melchi-** (Hebrew *melek*) means **king**. • **-zedek** (Hebrew *tsedeq*) means **justice** or *righteousness*. • **Salem** (Hebrew *shalom*) means **peace**. It was common for rabbis to bring out the theological significance of a biblical figure’s name by making associations between the name and other Hebrew terms.\n\n
7:3	idm164756					 That we have **no record** of Melchizedek’s **father or mother or any of his ancestors** is significant in light of the ancestral requirement upon which the Levitical priesthood was based. He appears from nowhere—it is as though there is **no beginning or end to his life**. The author is interpreting *Gen 14:17-20* in light of *Ps 110:4*, which also understands Melchizedek as representing an eternal priesthood. • **He remains a priest forever:** This contrasts with a Levite, whose priesthood ended when he died (*Heb 7:8*, *23*). • **resembling the Son of God:** Melchizedek was not an Old Testament appearance of Jesus. Rather, his priesthood and that of Jesus had characteristics in common, in light of *Ps 110:4*.\n\n
7:4	idm164772					 The point of this section (*7:1-10*) is to have the readers **consider** . . . **how great this Melchizedek was** by comparing him to the descendants of Levi. Melchizedek was so great that **Abraham** gave him **a tenth** of the spoils of **battle** (*Gen 14:20*).\n\n
7:5	idm164785					 Collecting the **tithe** was a requirement and an honor for the **priests** under **the law of Moses** (*Num 18:21-32*). • **from the rest of the people of Israel:** The reference is to the people of Israel as a whole. • Although **Melchizedek** was **not a descendant of Levi***,* he **collected a tenth from Abraham***,* the ancestor of the Levites. This demonstrates Melchizedek’s eminence over both Abraham and his descendants, including the priests (*Heb 7:8-10*).\n\n
7:6	idm164802					 **Melchizedek placed a blessing upon Abraham:** *Gen 14:19-20*; this is an example of the kind of blessing that a superior would give a subordinate—e.g., a father would bless his son, and a priest would bless his people (*Gen 49:1-28*; *Num 6:22-27*). The power to give a blessing demonstrates that Melchizedek **is greater than** Abraham.\n\n
7:8	idm164813					 Melchizedek’s “immortality” (*7:3*) is one aspect of his superiority to the Levites: The Levites **are men who die***,* but Melchizedek **lives on**.\n\n
7:9	idm164823					 **we might even say:** The author recognizes that what he is about to say, that the **Levites** . . . **paid a tithe to Melchizedek***,* is not literally true, since **Levi wasn’t born yet**. Abraham represented all his descendants in paying his tithe to Melchizedek. Levi was united with Abraham because **the seed from which he came was in Abraham’s body**. All the people issuing from Abraham were one with him. Thus, his act could be considered their act.\n\n
7:11	idm164835					 Having argued for Melchizedek’s superiority to the Levites (*7:1-10*), the author now argues that Jesus, our high priest like Melchizedek, is also superior to the Levitical priests of the old covenant.\n\n
7:11	idm164842					 **Perfection** in Hebrews does not mean *flawless,* but *reaching a desired goal* (see *study note on 5:9*). The priesthood under the old covenant could not achieve all that **God intended** for a covenant relationship with his people. That is why God needed **to establish a different priesthood**.\n\n
7:12	idm164854					 According to the law given to Moses, the appointed priests were descendants of Aaron (*Exod 28:41-43*; *29:9*). The **priesthood is changed** because Jesus is now the High Priest. Thus, God himself had **changed** the **law** concerning priests.\n\n
7:13	idm164865					 Jesus **belongs to a different tribe:** Under the old covenant, priests came from the tribe of Levi, whereas Jesus was from **the tribe of Judah**.\n\n
7:15	idm164873					 **This change** of how God appoints priests (*7:11-14*) has been made **very clear** by the appointment of Jesus as a **different priest**. He, **like Melchizedek***,* is **a priest forever:** Jesus’ resurrection from the dead shows that he has **the power of a life that cannot be destroyed**. Because his priesthood **in the order of Melchizedek** is superior to that of the Levites (*7:1-10*), he supersedes them as priest.\n\n
7:18	idm164889					 **The old requirement about the priesthood** was membership in the family of Aaron (see *Exod 28:41-43*). • **set aside:** See *Heb 7:15-17*. • **because it was weak and useless:** As explained in the verses that follow (*7:19-28*).\n\n
7:19	idm164901					 The weakness of the priesthood under the old covenant is highlighted in that those priests died (thus discontinuing their office) and were themselves sinful. In contrast, Jesus, the new High Priest, never sinned and conquered death, making him a more effective and permanent High Priest.\n\n
7:19	idm164907					 **the law never made anything perfect:** The law never accomplished what God planned to accomplish through the superior high priesthood of Jesus—namely, completely removing sin and guaranteeing eternal salvation. This gives believers **confidence in a better hope** in relationship with God. We can **draw near to God** without fearing condemnation.\n\n
7:20	idm164916					 **This new system** refers to God’s way of appointing a priest. • God’s **solemn oath** is expressed in the quote from *Ps 110:4*.\n\n
7:22	idm164925					 Legally, **the one who guarantees** (literally *the guarantee* or *the guarantor*) refers to the person who bears the risk of another person’s investment or debt. Because of God’s **oath***,* Jesus’ priesthood is unassailable, so our **covenant** relationship **with God** is secure. Having Jesus as the guarantor makes the new covenant **better**.\n\n
7:23	idm164939					 Of necessity, the old covenant had a succession of **many priests** because each of them died. In contrast, Jesus’ **priesthood lasts forever** (literally *is permanent*): This term refers to something that cannot be changed, such as the sun’s daily trek through the sky or the constant turning of the seasons.\n\n
7:25	idm164948					 **able, once and forever, to save:** Since Jesus **lives forever***,* the salvation he brings also lasts forever. To draw near to an eternal God, we need an eternal priest. • Jesus will **intercede** or *appeal* to God for us as our High Priest of the new covenant, and his intercession is never-ending (see *9:11-28*; *10:21-22*; *Rom 8:31-34*).\n\n
7:26	idm164962					 Jesus is **unstained by sin** and **set apart from sinners** (cp. *4:15*), which makes him superior to the priests of the old covenant, who had to deal with **their own sins** as well as those **of the people** (see also *5:1-3*). • **has been given the highest place of honor in heaven:** This is an affirmation of his uniqueness as High Priest (cp. *2:9*; *5:9*; *Phil 2:5-11*). • **once for all:** This does not mean *once for all people* but rather *once, never to be repeated.*\n\n
7:28	idm164981					 This verse echoes *5:1-3* and sums up the entire discussion of Christ’s appointment as High Priest (*5:1-10*; *7:1-28*). • **Limited by human weakness** refers primarily to human sinfulness and mortality (*5:2-3*; *7:18*, *23-27*). • **God appointed his Son with an oath:** See *Ps 110:4*, the key Old Testament passage behind *Heb 7:11-28*. • **perfect . . . forever:** The words **High Priest** are not in the Greek text but are implied in the context. • In Hebrews, the term **perfect** means *complete* or *mature* (see *2:10*; *5:9*; *7:11*; *9:9-11*); the Son, through his sacrificial death and resurrection, has become completely qualified to serve as our eternal High Priest, and his priesthood lasts **forever**.\n\n
8:1	idm165007					 This passage on Jesus’ superior offering argues that his ministry as the heavenly High Priest is superior to that of earthly priests.\n\n
8:1	idm165013					 The first two verses of ch *8* transition from the discussion just completed and anticipate the discussion to come. • **Here is the main point:** The author is referring back to the appointment of Jesus as a superior High Priest (*5:1-10*; *7:1-28*). • **he ministers in the heavenly Tabernacle** (or *tent;* also in *8:5*): This anticipates the theme of Jesus’ superior offering that is covered in the rest of this section (*8:3–10:18*). Unlike the Levitical priests who served in an earthly tent or building, Jesus’ sacrifice is superior because he serves in **the true place of worship***,* the very presence of God in heaven (*8:5*; *9:11*, *24*; *10:12*).\n\n
8:3	idm165033					 **every high priest is required to offer gifts and sacrifices:** Making offerings is a general requirement of priests, so Jesus also had to offer a sacrifice. • This verse reiterates what is stated in the first verse of the previous discussion (*5:1*), indicating another major movement in the book.\n\n
8:4	idm165041					 **If he were here on earth:** Under the old order Jesus **would not even be a priest***,* as previously discussed (see *7:13-14*). But Jesus is in heaven, which makes his priestly service distinct from and superior to that of the priests of the old covenant (*8:5*; *9:11*, *24*; *10:12*).\n\n
8:5	idm165055					 **a copy, a shadow:** The earthly place of worship was an imitation that pointed to **the real one in heaven**. That is why **God** warned **Moses** to make it **according to the pattern** (see *Exod 25:40*; *26:30*; cp. *Acts 7:44*). Judaism and early Christianity both spoke of a heavenly Temple within a heavenly Jerusalem, which would come down to earth at the end of the age (see *Rev 21:2*). Hebrews suggests that this heavenly place of worship was shown to Moses so he would know how to build the earthly Tabernacle. It is the heavenly Temple, however, in which Jesus ministers as High Priest.\n\n
8:6	idm165070					 **the one who mediates:** A mediator works with two parties to bring them to agreement. Christ’s work of sacrifice established the **covenant** relationship between people and God. • **a far better covenant with God:** See “*The New Covenant*” Theme Note. This covenant is better because it is **based on better promises** (see *8:7-13*).\n\n
8:7	idm165082					 The author quotes *Jer 31:31-34*, an Old Testament prophecy concerning the new covenant that includes a number of striking promises. Establishing the superiority of the new covenant lays a foundation for the argument in *Heb 9:1–10:18* that the Son’s offering under the new covenant was superior to the offerings of the old covenant.\n\n
8:7	idm165090					 The **first covenant***,* made at Sinai, was not **faultless**. It was not the end of God’s plan, because it didn’t solve human weaknesses (see *7:11-28*; *8:9*).\n\n
8:8	idm165101					 **found fault with the people:** Because the people were unable to keep the terms of the old covenant (see *study note on 8:7*), God made a **new covenant**.\n\n
8:9	idm165110					 God **made** a covenant **with their ancestors** at Sinai (*Exod 19:1-8*; *24:7-8*; *34:27-28*; *Deut 4:13*). • **I took them by the hand:** In rescuing his people from **the land of Egypt***,* God **led them** as a parent might lead a child that could not fend for itself (see *Exod 12–14*). • **They did not remain faithful:** See *Heb 3:7-19*; *Num 14:1-38*; *Deut 9*; *Ps 106*. • **so I turned my back on them:** The covenant warned that if the people turned away, God would turn away from them (see *Deut 28:15-68*; *30:11-20*; *1 Kgs 8:22-53*; *2 Chr 6:12-42*).\n\n
8:10	idm165137					 Under the old covenant, the people were commanded to take the words of the law to heart (*Deut 32:46*), and the kings of Israel and Judah were judged on whether or not they followed the law of God wholeheartedly (*2 Kgs 10:31*; *2 Chr 31:21*). A difference in the **new covenant** is that God’s **laws** would be in people’s **minds** and **on their hearts**. People would have renewed hearts and minds, with God’s law as an intrinsic, internal motivation.\n\n
8:11	idm165150					 All those in the new covenant **know the** Lord*;* intimate personal relationship with the Lord is in the very nature of the new covenant.\n\n
8:12	idm165159					 A final characteristic of the new covenant is that God would **forgive their wickedness** and **never again remember their sins**. The blood of Jesus cleanses his people completely from sin (*9:13-15*; *10:14-18*, *22*; *1 Jn 1:7*).\n\n
8:13	idm165171					 The word *new* in **“new” covenant** emphasizes that, once God had enacted this covenant, the Sinai covenant was considered *old* or **obsolete** and was thus **out of date**. Its time of usefulness was over and its termination was imminent.\n\n
9:1	idm165182					 This section argues that Christ’s death, the sacrifice in the new covenant, is superior to the sacrifices in the old covenant. In *9:1-10*, the author describes aspects of worship under the **regulations** of the old covenant (see *Exod 28–29*; *Lev 1–10*; *16:1–17:16*). In *Heb 9:11–10:18*, these regulations are contrasted with Christ’s superior offering.\n\n
9:1	idm165194					 These verses describe the **Tabernacle**, Israel’s **place of worship** before the Temple was constructed.\n\n
9:2	idm165202					 Israel’s **Tabernacle** was a tent with **two rooms** (see *Exod 25–31*; *35:1–40:38*). • **a lampstand:** *Exod 25:31-40*; *26:35*. • **a table:** *Exod 25:23-30*. • The priests went into the **Holy Place** daily in their ritual duties (*Heb 9:6*; see *Exod 28:43*; *Num 28:3-8*).\n\n
9:3	idm165221					 At the back of the first room of the Tabernacle was a **curtain** that separated the first room from the **second room called the Most Holy Place** (*Exod 26:31-33*). This curtain was a sacred barrier: Only the high priest could go behind it into the Most Holy Place, and only once a year on the Day of Atonement (*Heb 9:7*; see *Exod 30:6*, *10*; *Lev 16:2-34*; *23:27-32*).\n\n
9:4	idm165235					 The **gold incense altar** probably stood just outside the inner curtain (*Exod 30:1-10*); its location is ambiguous at points in the Old Testament, but it was closely associated with the Most Holy Place (*Exod 30:6*; *Lev 16:13*; *1 Kgs 6:22*). • Since it represented the presence of God, the **Ark of the Covenant** was the most important item in the Tabernacle (see *Exod 25:10-22*). • The **gold jar containing manna** was a reminder of God’s provision in the wilderness (*Exod 16:32-34*). • **Aaron’s staff that sprouted leaves** (see *Num 17:1-11*) was a reminder not to rebel against God’s chosen leaders (*Num 17:10*; cp. *Heb 13:17*). • The **stone tablets of the covenant** held the Ten Commandments and were to remind the people of the terms by which they were to live out the covenant (*Exod 25:16*; *31:18*; *Deut 9:9–10:5*).\n\n
9:5	idm165258					 **The cherubim of divine glory** were statues of angels formed into the Ark’s cover. This category of angels is especially associated with God’s glorious presence (*Gen 3:24*; *Pss 80:1*; *99:1*; *Isa 37:16*). The **Ark’s cover** itself was **the place of atonement***,* on which the blood from the Day of Atonement sacrifice was to be sprinkled (*Lev 16:14-16*). • **But we cannot explain these things in detail now:** The main focus of the discussion is the offering of sacrifices under the old covenant (*Heb 9:6-10*).\n\n
9:6	idm165275					 The worship practices in the Holy Place, the **first room** of the Tabernacle (*9:2*), were the duty of the priests, who kept the lamps lit and the sacred loaves of bread replenished (*Exod 27:20-21*; *Lev 24:8*).\n\n
9:7	idm165285					 The yearly duty was carried out on the Day of Atonement, when **the high priest** offered sacrifices for **the sins** not covered by other sacrifices during the previous year (*Lev 16:1-25*).\n\n
9:8	idm165294					 **was not freely open:** Free entrance into the presence of God was not available to all of the people under the old covenant system. • The outer room of **the Tabernacle***,* which served as a sacred barrier keeping the people from the presence of God in **the Most Holy Place***,* was symbolic of the whole system. Under that system, people were kept out of God’s presence rather than led into it.\n\n
9:9	idm165305					 **This is an illustration:** The problem with **the gifts and sacrifices** of the old covenant is that they were **not able to cleanse the consciences of the people**—they could not remove people’s guilt before a holy God (cp. *9:14*; *10:2*, *22*; *13:18*).\n\n
9:10	idm165318					 The **old system** dealt only with **physical regulations***,* and it could not deal with the condition of the heart (*8:10*; *10:21-24*). Consequently, it was provisional, only intended to last until Christ could come and establish a **better system** (*9:11–10:18*).\n\n
9:11	idm165331					 The author now contrasts the old system (*9:1-10*) with the superior sacrifice made by Christ as High Priest: The blood of Christ’s offering was his own blood, not the blood of animals (*9:13-22*; cp. *9:7*); Christ’s offering was made in the heavenly Tabernacle, not the earthly one (*9:23-24*; cp. *9:1-5*); and Christ’s offering, rather than being made continually, was made just one time (*9:25–10:18*; cp. *7:27*; *9:6-7*).\n\n
9:11	idm165345					 **Christ has now become the High Priest over all the good things** of the new covenant. He was appointed by God in accord with *Ps 110:4* (*Heb 5:1-10*; *7:1-28*) and offered a superior offering. • **that have come:** Some manuscripts read *that are about to come,* either from the perspective of the old covenant era or looking forward to the culmination of God’s plan in the future. • Christ’s sacrifice is superior because of where it was made: in **that greater, more perfect Tabernacle in heaven** rather than the earthly Tabernacle (see *8:5* and *corresponding study note*).\n\n
9:12	idm165360					 Christ’s offering is superior because it was made **with his own blood** rather than **the blood of goats and calves** (e.g., cp. *Lev 16:3-5*). • Christ’s offering is superior because **he entered the Most Holy Place once for all time**. Unlike the sacrifices in the old covenant, which had to be made year after year (*Heb 10:1*), Jesus’ sacrificial death only had to be made once and was decisive in securing **our redemption forever**.\n\n
9:13	idm165372					 The **ashes of a heifer** were used with water to **cleanse people’s bodies from ceremonial impurity** (see *Num 19*).\n\n
9:14	idm165381					 **how much more:** This is an argument from lesser to greater, a traditional Jewish rhetorical strategy; the logic is that if something is true in a lesser situation, it will be even more true in a greater situation (see also *2:1-4*; *12:25-29*). If the blood of animals had some effect in cleansing, the blood of Christ will be much more effective. • **will purify our consciences:** Christ’s sacrifice, unlike the sacrifices of the old covenant, removes the paralyzing guilt that keeps us from God by decisively cleansing us **from sinful deeds**.\n\n
9:15	idm165392					 **the one who mediates:** This term refers to an arbiter in a difficult legal dispute or political disagreement. In the old covenant, Moses and the angels were understood as mediators between God and the people (*Gal 3:19-20*). In the **new covenant***,* Christ **mediates** the relationship between **God and people** by his sacrificial death (*Heb 8:6*; *12:24*; *Rom 6:23*; *1 Tim 2:5*; *1 Pet 3:18*) and ongoing intercession (*Heb 7:25*).\n\n
9:16	idm165410					 The author gives a general principle about the nature of wills or covenants (*9:16-17*), which he then expounds in light of the inauguration of the first covenant (*9:18-22*).\n\n
9:18	idm165418					 **was put into effect:** *Exod 24:3-8* records Moses’ inauguration of the old covenant with the blood of the sacrifice. • Hebrews alone among ancient sources states that Moses sprinkled **the book of God’s law** (cp. *Exod 24:6-8*). • **Hyssop branches** have blue flowers and strongly aromatic leaves; they were used with sacrifices for cleansing (*Exod 12:22*; *Lev 14:4*; *Num 19:6*, *18*).\n\n
9:20	idm165433					 **“This blood confirms the covenant God has made with you”** (*Exod 24:8*): Jesus used similar language at the Lord’s Supper, referring to his own death (*Matt 26:28*; *Mark 14:24*; *1 Cor 11:25*).\n\n
9:21	idm165444					 **he sprinkled blood:** See *Exod 24:3-8*; *Lev 16:14-19*.\n\n
9:22	idm165453					 Many of the rituals of cleansing in **the law of Moses** involved the death of a sacrificial animal; **blood** was involved both in the rites of cleansing (see *Exod 29:12*; *30:10*; *Lev 4:6*, *17*; *16:14-19*; *Num 19:4*) and in making atonement (see *Lev 16*). The **shedding** of Christ’s blood established the new covenant, providing permanent purification and complete **forgiveness** of sins (*Heb 8:12*; *10:15-18*; *Matt 26:28*; *Eph 1:7*).\n\n
9:23	idm165474					 This verse argues from lesser to greater (see *study note on 9:14*). Just as **heaven** is greater than the earthly **Tabernacle***,* so Christ’s sacrifice **had to be** . . . **far better** than the earthly sacrifices. • **That is why:** See *9:16-22*; *Lev 16:14-19*. • **copies of things in heaven:** See *study note on Heb 8:5*. • **in heaven, had to be purified:** Just as the Tabernacle had to be cleansed because of the sin of the Israelites (*Lev 16:16-19*), the heavenly Tabernacle required that the uncleanness be removed from those who would enter heaven under the new covenant.\n\n
9:24	idm165493					 Under the new covenant, **Christ** did not offer his sacrifice in the earthly Tabernacle. Rather, he **entered into** the very presence of God in **heaven** to act **on our behalf**. His sacrifice makes him a much better mediator to bring us into a right relationship with God (*2 Cor 5:19-21*).\n\n
9:25	idm165504					 Under the old covenant, the sacrifice on the Day of Atonement had to be made **again and again** (*Lev 16:29-34*). Christ’s superior sacrifice was made **once for all time**.\n\n
9:26	idm165513					 **If that had been necessary:** The author makes an argument using *reductio ad absurdum* (reduction to absurdity), logically showing that Christ’s one-time sacrifice must be permanently effective. Since Christ himself is the **sacrifice** as well as the high priest, if his offering were made every year as with the earthly high priests, he would have to **die again and again**. But of course this is absurd; so, clearly, Christ died **once for all time** . . . **to remove sin**.\n\n
9:27	idm165525					 Christ’s first coming was to **take away the sins of many people**. When **he will come again***,* it will not be to deal with sins, since that has already been accomplished. Instead, he will **bring salvation to all who are eagerly waiting for him** (see *study note on Gal 5:5*).\n\n
10:1	idm165536					 **The old system under the law of Moses** (literally *The law*), like the Tabernacle itself (*8:5*), **was only a shadow, a dim preview** of a greater reality—namely, **the good things** that Christ inaugurated in the new covenant. Under the old covenant, **sacrifices** had to be **repeated again and again** because they were not able to cleanse worshipers permanently or in such a way that they could come into the presence of God perpetually.\n\n
10:2	idm165549					 The perpetual nature of the sacrifices demonstrates their inadequacy. **If** the sacrifices of the old covenant had offered true, lasting purity, they **would have stopped**. • **their feelings of guilt would have disappeared:** Cp. *9:9*, *14*; *10:22*; *13:18*.\n\n
10:3	idm165562					 **Instead** of removing guilt, the ongoing sacrifices **actually reminded** those who wished to come near to God, **year after year***,* that they were guilty before God.\n\n
10:4	idm165572					 The **blood of bulls and goats** in the sacrifices of the old covenant offered a degree of cleansing (*9:13*, *23*), but that cleansing was limited in that it could not **take away sins**. It could not eradicate sin in a way that would offer permanent cleansing and peace with God (see *Acts 10:36*; *Rom 5:1*; *11:26-27*).\n\n
10:5	idm165585					 These verses quote *Ps 40:6-8*. *Psalm 40* is a hymn of praise to God in which the psalmist confesses his desire to do God’s will. The author of Hebrews understands **Christ** to be the speaker.\n\n
10:5	idm165594					 **But you have given me a body to offer:** God had prepared the psalmist to be obedient, ready to do God’s will; Hebrews now applies this idea to Christ. For Hebrews, the preparation of a human *body*, specifically Christ’s body, shows that God would use it as a superior sacrifice.\n\n
10:8	idm165602					 The author follows the flow of thought in the psalm with great precision. • **First, Christ said, “You did not want animal sacrifices . . .”:** The author of Hebrews understands this as God’s rejection of the old system of sacrifices. • **Then he said, “Look, I have come to do your will”:** The author of Hebrews takes this to be Christ’s willingness to be the supreme sacrifice for sins. • The author of Hebrews concludes that because of Christ’s sacrifice, God has canceled the first covenant—**God’s will***,* as shown by *Ps 40:6-8*, was that Christ would die for sins as a **sacrifice***,* and this only had to be done **once for all time**.\n\n
10:11	idm165616					 Christ’s superior offering was decisive, in contrast with the sacrifices made by the priests of the old covenant.\n\n
10:11	idm165622					 **the priest stands:** See *Deut 18:5*. • **day after day:** E.g., *2 Chr 13:11*.\n\n
10:12	idm165632					 Christ’s sacrifice contrasts with that of the earthly high priests in that he **offered himself to God as a** . . . **sacrifice***,* rather than offering animal sacrifices. • After the sacrifice was accomplished, **he sat down in the place of honor** (see *Ps 110:1*). Instead of standing daily like the priests of the old covenant (*Heb 10:11*), **he waits until his enemies are humbled and made a footstool under his feet** (*Ps 110:1*).\n\n
10:14	idm165646					 **made perfect:** See study notes on *7:11*, *28*. • **those who are being made holy:** What the author has in mind is complete purification from sins.\n\n
10:15	idm165656					 The author again quotes from *Jer 31:33-34* (see *Heb 8:7-12*) to support the statement in *10:14*, that Christ’s one offering under the new covenant has made worshipers perfect forever. • God’s **laws** have now been placed **in their hearts** and **on their minds**. This has internalized the believer’s relationship with God. • **I will never again remember their sins and lawless deeds:** As the author has shown (*9:11–10:14*), the superior sacrifice of Christ has made this new covenant reality possible.\n\n
10:18	idm165670					 The logical conclusion **when sins have been forgiven**—that is, when sins have been taken away completely and permanently (*10:1-4*, *11*)—is that **there is no need to offer any more sacrifices**. Thus, the superior sacrifice of Christ has made the entire sacrificial system of the old covenant obsolete.\n\n
10:19	idm165680					 The author of Hebrews repeats words and concepts from *4:14-16* to mark off and summarize the central section (*4:14–10:18*) and to introduce the exhortations that follow, offering a concise statement of the message of Hebrews: The new covenant, established by Jesus’ superior ministry, gives us a superior basis for drawing near to God and for persevering in the Christian life.\n\n
10:19	idm165688					 The earthly **Most Holy Place** was not freely accessible (see *study note on 9:3*). Now, however, the very presence of God in heaven (*9:11*, *24*) is open **because of the blood of Jesus** in his sacrificial death (*9:11–10:18*).\n\n
10:20	idm165700					 **By his death:** Jesus’ death has **opened a new and life-giving way** for us **through the curtain***,* an allusion to the curtain separating the first and second rooms of the Tabernacle (see *9:1-5*). Believers now enter the **Most Holy Place** of God’s presence through Jesus’ sacrificial death.\n\n
10:21	idm165712					 Jesus, as Messiah, is the **High Priest** and king **who rules over God’s house***,* the people of God (see *3:1-6*; *2 Sam 7:13*).\n\n
10:22	idm165723					 **sincere hearts:** Under the new covenant, believers have transformed hearts (*8:10*; *10:16*; *Jer 31:31-34*). • **fully trusting him:** Christ’s work on our behalf gives us confidence that God will welcome us into his **presence**. • **our guilty consciences have been sprinkled . . . our bodies have been washed:** Christ’s sacrificial death has provided complete cleansing from sin (see *9:13-14*, *19-23*).\n\n
10:23	idm165738					 We are to **hold tightly . . . to the hope we affirm***,* that Christ’s death is effective in winning us right relationship with God.\n\n
10:24	idm165746					 **Acts of love and good works** characterize true Christian commitment (*6:10*; *10:32-34*; *Gal 5:13*; *1 Thes 1:3*; *Rev 2:19*).\n\n
10:25	idm165758					 Some in this Christian community had evidently begun to **neglect** their **meeting together** in regular worship, perhaps to avoid persecution (*10:32-39*). • Our motivating one another to love and good works should be done in light of **the day of his return***,* Christ’s second coming (*9:28*; *Luke 12:42-46*; *1 Cor 5:5*; *1 Thes 5:2*; *2 Pet 3:10*; *1 Jn 2:28*).\n\n
10:26	idm165775					 The author interjects a strong warning concerning the danger of rejecting God’s Son and his authoritative word. The warning challenges hearers to respond with a commitment to follow Christ.\n\n
10:26	idm165781					 **deliberately:** Open rebellion against God’s laws was described as “sinning with a high hand” (see *study note on Num 15:30-31*). Here the author has in mind specifically a rejection of Christ and his work. Christ’s sacrifice for sins has done away with the sacrificial system of the old covenant (*Heb 9:11–10:18*). If a person rejects the Son’s sacrifice, **there is no** other **sacrifice**—nowhere else to go—for forgiveness. A person who rejects Christ can only expect **judgment** as one of God’s **enemies** (cp. *Isa 26:10-11*).\n\n
10:28	idm165795					 The author argues from lesser to greater (see *study note on 9:14*). The lesser situation is the old punishment of **death** for a person **who refused to obey the law of Moses** (see *Deut 13:6-11*). The greater situation concerns those who reject Christ and treat him with contempt. • **how much worse the punishment:** Eternal damnation is the fate awaiting those who have rejected Christ. • **The blood of the covenant, which made us holy***,* is Christ’s perfect sacrifice (*9:11–10:18*). • **insulted and disdained the Holy Spirit:** Those who reject the Spirit’s prompting and mercy deny the validity of the Good News and the superiority of Christ and his saving work (cp. *Mark 3:22-30*).\n\n
10:30	idm165811					 **“The** Lord** will judge his own people”:** *Deut 32:36*; cp. *1 Pet 4:17-18*. • That God *will pay them back* and *will judge his own people* shows the dreadful circumstances of those who have rejected Christ. Once God moves to judge a person, no one can rescue that person out of God’s hand (*Deut 32:39*).\n\n
10:32	idm165825					 The harsh warning (*10:26-31*) is followed by a word of encouragement. The hearers’ own faithfulness in the past is used as a positive example for them to follow now.\n\n
10:32	idm165832					 **when you first learned about Christ:** The author reminds his readers of **those early days***,* shortly after the community embraced Christianity, when their faith was tested. At that time, they **remained faithful** in the face of **terrible suffering**. Suffering is normal for a person who identifies with Christ and his community (*13:12-13*; *Acts 9:16*; *Rom 8:17*; *1 Cor 4:12-13*; *Phil 1:29*; *Jas 1:2-4*).\n\n
10:33	idm165849					 **public ridicule:** They were insulted and disgraced. • **beaten:** They were abused physically. • At times they were direct recipients of abuse, and at times they stood with **others who were suffering**.\n\n
10:34	idm165858					 **those who were thrown into jail:** Prisoners were dependent on friends and family for the most basic daily needs (cp. *13:3*). • **when all you owned was taken from you:** At times, the Roman government evicted groups of people from their homes and forced them to leave a city (see *Acts 18:2-3*). These Christians had faced this kind of persecution in the past and **accepted it with joy** (cp. *Rom 5:3*; *Jas 1:2-4*; *1 Pet 1:6*). They anticipated **better things** . . . **that will last forever** (see *Heb 11:35*). God promises rewards to those who persevere faithfully.\n\n
10:35	idm165875					 Based on their exemplary faithfulness in the past (*10:32-34*), the author urges them not to **throw away this confident trust in the Lord**. The word translated *confident trust* is also used in Hebrews to speak of *boldness* in entering the presence of God (*4:16*; *10:19*; cp. *3:6*). Those who remain faithful receive a **great reward** (see *1:14*; *6:12*; *9:15*; *Jas 1:12*). **Patient endurance** is the key response needed in the face of persecution, as the author argues in *Heb 10:32–12:17*.\n\n
10:37	idm165895					 These verses quote *Hab 2:3-4* to contrast the righteous and the wicked as they face God’s judgment (cp. *Rom 1:17*; *Gal 3:11*).\n\n
10:39	idm165904					 The author ends this section with a statement of confidence in his hearers (see *study note on 6:9*).\n\n
11:1	idm165911					 In presenting readers with a long catalog of faith-filled heroes, ch *11* builds up overwhelming evidence that the life of faith is the only real way to live for God. The writer repeats the phrase **by faith** to drive this main message into the minds and hearts of his hearers. The examples follow a pattern: (a) the phrase *by faith,* (b) the name of the person, (c) the event or action which demonstrated faith, and (d) the outcome.\n\n
11:1	idm165920					 Before presenting the list of examples, the author defines what **faith** is: It is acting on what God has revealed about his will and character. • The **reality** that grounds our faith is the God who fulfills his promises.\n\n
11:2	idm165928					 **earned a good reputation:** Scripture speaks favorably about their lives of faith (see also *11:39*).\n\n
11:3	idm165936					 **That the entire universe was formed at God’s command** is a basic belief of Jewish and Christian theology (see *Gen 1:1-3*). God created everything that **we now see**. A life of faith understands that, by analogy, God’s promises are real and will be called into reality by God himself, even if they are unseen at present.\n\n
11:4	idm165945					 **Abel:** See *Gen 4:3-5*. • **evidence that he was a righteous man:** Cp. *Heb 10:38*. • **he still speaks to us:** The story of his faith challenges us, and his blood bears witness to his righteousness and to the injustice of his murder (see *12:24*).\n\n
11:5	idm165957					 **Enoch was taken up to heaven** and thus did not face a normal death (see *Gen 5:21-24*). • **“he disappeared, because God took him”:** *Gen 5:24*.\n\n
11:6	idm165967					 **it is impossible to please God without faith:** The author alludes to *10:38*, which quotes *Hab 2:4*. • Faith must include believing **that God exists and that he rewards those who sincerely seek him**. In life’s difficulties, readers are challenged to trust in God and to anticipate the fulfillment of his promises.\n\n
11:7	idm165977					 The story of **Noah** (see *Gen 6:1–9:17*) further demonstrates that faith involves obedience in the face of the unseen. • **things that had never happened before:** Namely, **the flood**. Noah’s faith **condemned the rest of the world** by bearing witness to God’s reality and his desire for holiness.\n\n
11:8	idm165988					 **Abraham obeyed:** See *Gen 12:1-2*. He, too, acted in the face of what he could not yet see, since **he went without knowing where he was going**.\n\n
11:9	idm165997					 **he lived there by faith:** Abraham himself did not experience the inheritance of the land of promise. Rather, he **was like a foreigner, living in tents** (see *Gen 12:10–13:18*). • **so did Isaac and Jacob:** This life of faith was continued in the next two generations: They received the **same promise** and hoped in God, but did not experience what God had promised. • **city with eternal foundations:** Abraham did not settle in the Canaanite cities but followed the will of God in faithful obedience, anticipating a heavenly city.\n\n
11:12	idm166009					 **this one man who was as good as dead:** Abraham was very old, yet he became the source for **a whole nation**. Faith involves believing that God is able to answer his promises seemingly out of nothing. • **like the stars . . . and the sand:** See *Gen 22:17*. God fulfilled the promise (*Exod 1:7*).\n\n
11:13	idm166020					 The author pauses to point out general principles evident in the lives he has highlighted thus far.\n\n
11:13	idm166026					 Abraham’s family lived in the land of promise as **foreigners and nomads** (see *Gen 23:4*; cp. *1 Chr 29:15*; *Ps 39:12*; *1 Pet 2:11*).\n\n
11:14	idm166037					 Abraham’s family was obviously not longing for the **country they came from***,* since if that had been the case, **they could have gone back**. Their posture of faith demonstrates a longing for **a better place**. Their hope was ultimately in God, who rewarded their faith by preparing **a heavenly** . . . **city for them**.\n\n
11:17	idm166049					 Great examples of faith take the reader from Abraham’s family to Rahab. These examples build up evidence that faith is the only appropriate response to God.\n\n
11:17	idm166055					 **Abraham offered Isaac:** See *Gen 22:1-18*. God never intended for Abraham to offer his son but **was testing** Abraham’s faith, which he expressed through his obedience.\n\n
11:19	idm166064					 **Abraham reasoned:** The resurrection of Isaac was the only answer to Abraham’s dilemma. In *Gen 22:5*, Abraham expressed confidence that Isaac would return with him.\n\n
11:20	idm166072					 **Isaac promised blessings:** See *Gen 27:27-40*; the only part of the story that can be considered a blessing for Esau is that he would eventually shake off his subservience to his brother. Esau was later blessed by Jacob’s riches (*Gen 33:8-11*).\n\n
11:21	idm166081					 **Jacob** passed the ritual blessing on to **Joseph’s sons***,* Ephraim and Manasseh (*Gen 48:8-22*). • **bowed in worship:** *Gen 47:31*. The phrase **as he leaned on his staff** comes from the Greek translation of the Old Testament.\n\n
11:22	idm166094					 Joseph’s prophecy and command (see *Gen 50:24-25*) showed faith that God would keep his promises.\n\n
11:23	idm166101					 **Moses’ parents:** See *Exod 2:1-2*. • **unusual** (or *attractive,* or *beautiful*): This word refers to something of superior quality. Their insight that Moses was extraordinary led them to act by faith in God. • **the king’s command:** *Exod 1:22*.\n\n
11:24	idm166114					 **Moses, when he grew up:** See *Exod 2:11-15*. Moses took a public stand with the people of Israel rather than continuing **to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter***,* who had adopted him (*Exod 2:3-10*). Therefore, **he chose to share the oppression of God’s people***,* as the readers of this letter were being called to do (see *Heb 10:32-34*).\n\n
11:26	idm166128					 **the treasures of Egypt:** The New Kingdom of Egypt (about 1550–1069 BC) was an era of phenomenal wealth and political power. Moses evidently had a greater **reward** in mind.\n\n
11:27	idm166137					 Like his forefather Abraham, **Moses** acted in **faith** by leaving **the land of Egypt,** with which he was familiar, and walked into an unknown future (*Exod 2:15*). • **not fearing the king’s anger:** Rather than watching the king, he **kept his eyes on the one who is invisible**—God.\n\n
11:28	idm166149					 **Moses commanded . . . the Passover:** See *Exod 12:1-27*. The first Passover (*Exod 12:28-30*) initiated the Exodus (*Exod 12:31-42*, *50-51*) and instituted the annual Passover observance as a memorial (*Exod 12:43-49*; *13:1-16*). • **to sprinkle blood:** The sprinkling of the blood of sacrifices under the old covenant was parallel to the sprinkling of Christ’s blood (see *Heb 9:12-14*, *18-22*).\n\n
11:29	idm166165					 The rescue **through the Red Sea** (see *Exod 13:17–14:21*) constitutes the greatest moment of deliverance in Israel’s history. The people’s fear and accusation at the time (*Exod 14:10-12*) do not obviously exemplify **faith***,* but the people went forward when told to do so despite their fear. The episode demonstrates that obedience is central to faith.\n\n
11:30	idm166176					 The conquest of **Jericho** (*Josh 5:13–6:27*) offers another example of great faith, as the people acted in obedience to God’s unusual instructions.\n\n
11:31	idm166184					 **Rahab the prostitute** (*Josh 2*; *6:25*) showed faith in the power of the God of Israel by protecting the spies who came to her home (cp. *Jas 2:25*). As a result, she and her family were **not destroyed** but joined the community of Israel. In fact, Rahab was an ancestor of Jesus (*Matt 1:5*).\n\n
11:32	idm166196					 In a rapid series of examples, the author gives an overview of other faithful people through the rest of the old covenant era. In *11:32-35a*, the outcome of faith is deliverance and victory. In *11:35b-38*, however, faith brought severe persecution and even martyrdom. The result for both groups was that God honored them with a good reputation because of their faith (*11:39*).\n\n
11:32	idm166205					 **How much more do I need to say?** The author makes a transition to his concluding summary, which begins with six heroes of faith from the time of the judges and the united monarchy. **Gideon** defeated the Midianites with torches and jars (*Judg 7:7-25*). **Barak** routed Sisera and the Canaanites (*Judg 4:8-16*). **Samson***,* though weak in moral fiber, was used by God to fight the Philistines on behalf of Israel (*Judg 13–16*). **Jephthah** won victory over the Amorites and Ammonites (*Judg 10:6–12:7*). **David***,* the only king in the group, loved God and, for the most part, led an exemplary life of faith (*1 Sam 16—1 Kgs 1*). **Samuel** was an important transitional leader between the judges and the monarchy; he heard God’s voice and obeyed his will (*1 Sam 1–15*). • The statement **all the prophets** includes Elijah, Elisha, and the “writing prophets” from Isaiah to Malachi. The prophets often exhibited great faith in the face of hostility.\n\n
11:33	idm166227					 **overthrew kingdoms:** During the time of the judges and the reign of David, Israel defeated many of their enemies. David and Solomon and a few others **ruled with justice** (see *2 Sam 8:15*; *1 Kgs 10:9*). • **shut the mouths of lions:** See *Dan 6:1-23*.\n\n
11:34	idm166239					 **quenched the flames of fire:** See *Dan 3:16-30*. • **escaped death by the edge of the sword:** E.g., Elijah and Jeremiah (see *1 Kgs 19:2*; *2 Kgs 1:1-18*; *Jer 26:10-16*; *38:1-13*).\n\n
11:35	idm166252					 Elijah and Elisha both brought women’s **loved ones back again from death** (see *1 Kgs 17:17-24*; *2 Kgs 4:17-37*). • **But others were tortured:** Faith does not always have a positive outcome in this life. The author might be alluding to the 170s and 160s BC, when many Jews suffered and died rather than forsake their faith (see, e.g., *1 Maccabees* 1:20-64).\n\n
11:37	idm166264					 According to tradition, the prophet Jeremiah **died by stoning** and the prophet Isaiah was **sawed in half**.\n\n
11:38	idm166272					 **too good for this world:** Their hope was in God more than in the pleasures and comforts of this world.\n\n
11:39	idm166279					 The way to live as God’s people under the new covenant is to live as **all these people** did under the old covenant: by **faith** in God’s promises, enduring any difficulties faced in this world. • **earned a good reputation:** God has borne witness to their faithfulness (see also *11:2*). • **yet none of them received all that God had promised:** They all died prior to Christ’s promised coming; the **something better** began with Christ’s sacrificial work (*8:3–10:18*) and anticipates the future culmination of God’s plan for his people. • **would not reach perfection:** See study notes on *5:9*; *7:11*. Jesus has fulfilled God’s goal of bringing his people into relationship with him.\n\n
12:1	idm166295					 The author challenges his hearers to endure in following Jesus, the supreme example of faithfulness, by imitating him in his suffering (*12:1-4*), by enduring under God’s discipline (*12:5-13*), and by living in peace with others (*12:14-17*).\n\n
12:1	idm166304					 **huge crowd of witnesses:** The host of faithful followers of God (ch *11*) bear witness to the truth that God blesses **the life of faith**. • **let us strip off every weight:** In Greco-Roman literature, a race is a metaphor for the need for endurance in life. Just as extra weight hinders a runner, **sin*** . . . ***trips us up**. It entangles us and restricts us from moving by faith.\n\n
12:2	idm166317					 Jesus is the supreme example of faithful endurance (*3:1*). Our endurance in the Christian life will depend on our **keeping our eyes on Jesus**—staying focused on him and his work on our behalf. • **Jesus, the champion who initiates and perfects our faith:** Jesus has accomplished everything necessary for faith under the new covenant to be a reality. • **disregarding its shame:** Crucifixion was the most shameful form of execution, meant to humiliate and torture the person crucified. It was used only for slaves and criminals who were not Roman citizens. Christ treated that shame as if it were nothing. • **seated in the place of honor:** The author again alludes to *Ps 110:1* (see also *Heb 1:3*, *13*; *8:1*; *10:12*).\n\n
12:3	idm166333					 **Think of all the hostility he endured from sinful people:** The recipients of Hebrews had **become weary** and were about to **give up**—they were emotionally fatigued because of the persecution they were facing. The key to their endurance was to focus on Jesus, who had been through even worse hostility.\n\n
12:4	idm166342					 **not yet given your lives:** This community had not yet faced martyrdom for the faith. (This is one reason to date Hebrews prior to Nero’s persecution in the mid-60s AD.) If Jesus could endure a shameful death, the hearers should be able to endure lesser persecution.\n\n
12:5	idm166350					 In these verses, **the encouraging words** are quoted from *Prov 3:11-12*, a passage that regards hardship as **the** Lord**’s** loving **discipline** for his **children**. God can turn a wide variety of trials and difficulties to our good, training us in righteousness and holy character.\n\n
12:7	idm166363					 **disciplined by its father:** Fathers from Greco-Roman as well as Jewish families were involved in day-to-day aspects of raising their children. Discipline was seen as a necessary, healthy, and important component of preparing the child for adulthood. A lack of fatherly discipline—in this case, a lack of hardships in life—is a mark of illegitimacy, not a blessing.\n\n
12:9	idm166370					 The author argues from lesser to greater (see *study note on 9:14*). Here, the lesser situation is the respect shown to an earthly father when he is giving discipline. We should **submit even more to the discipline of the Father of our spirits** in the more important context of our relationship with God. We should adopt a posture of yielding to God as to a good Father, trusting that he is helping us grow even through painful circumstances.\n\n
12:10	idm166378					 There are at least two limitations on an earthly father’s discipline. First, his discipline, or education, is only **for a few years** (literally *for a few days*)—children eventually leave home. Second, earthly fathers were **doing the best they knew how** from their limited perspectives. By contrast, God’s discipline lasts throughout life and **is always good for us***,* based on his limitless knowledge and love. His goal is **that we might share in his holiness**. Although it is **painful***,* discipline brings about **a peaceful harvest of right living**. It brings God’s children into a state conducive to harmonious relationships and doing what is right (see also *Rom 5:3-4*; *8:17*, *28*; *2 Cor 4:17*; *Phil 1:12-14*; *Jas 1:2-4*; *1 Pet 1:7*; *4:14*).\n\n
12:12	idm166401					 The author, alluding to *Isa 35:3-8* and *Prov 4:26*, encourages those who are emotionally and spiritually exhausted. According to *Isa 35*, God is in the process of defeating his enemies and is making a **straight path** for the righteous so that they **will not fall**.\n\n
12:14	idm166412					 Those who are **living a holy life** have confident hope of seeing **the Lord** (see *1 Jn 2:28*; *3:21*; *4:17*).\n\n
12:15	idm166423					 The **poisonous root of bitterness** alludes to people turning their backs on God’s covenant to serve other gods (*Deut 29:18*). Bitterness can corrupt the church.\n\n
12:16	idm166431					 Ancient Jewish literature describes Esau as sexually **immoral** because he was married to the Hittite women Judith and Basemath (*Gen 26:34*; see *Jubilees* 25:1; Philo, *On the Virtues* 208). • Esau’s lack of regard for his birthright (*Gen 25:29-34*) was **godless**. His willingness to give up God’s blessings for immediate satisfaction illustrates the opposite of faith.\n\n
12:17	idm166443					 Hebrews sees Esau’s disregard for his inheritance (*12:16*) and his loss of the **blessing** (*Gen 27:30-40*) as intrinsically related. The result was **bitter tears**. By analogy, those who reject an inheritance through Christ’s new covenant have only bitterness in their future.\n\n
12:18	idm166453					 This passage contrasts the old covenant with the new. The old covenant, represented by Mount Sinai (*12:18-21*), is depicted as impersonal, intimidating, and unapproachable; it booms, flashes, and terrifies. The new covenant, represented by Mount Zion (*12:22-24*), is depicted as relational, welcoming, and celebratory.\n\n
12:18	idm166461					 The descriptions of **Mount Sinai** come directly from God’s encounter with Israel at that mountain (see *Exod 19:16-22*; *20:18-21*; *Deut 4:11-12*; *5:23-27*). The images communicate separation from a holy God.\n\n
12:19	idm166472					 The **awesome trumpet blast and a voice** terrified the people (see *Exod 19:16*, *19*; *20:18*; *Deut 4:12*) so that **they begged God to stop speaking** (*Exod 20:19*).\n\n
12:22	idm166485					 **No:** There is a strong contrast between the old and the new covenant. Believers have now come to wonderful **Mount Zion***,* which is closely associated with Jerusalem and represents God’s dwelling place. • **heavenly Jerusalem:** See *study note on 8:5*. • The new covenant constitutes a relationship with God by which we experience his presence with joy, peace, and fellowship.\n\n
12:23	idm166496					 The word translated **assembly** is usually translated “church”; it speaks of God’s assembled people. • **God’s firstborn children** refers to people who are members of the new covenant (cp. *1:6*; *2:10-13*). • The concept that God’s people have their **names** . . . **written in heaven** speaks of God’s special attention to his people (see also *Exod 32:32*; *Ps 69:28*; *Isa 4:3*; *Dan 12:1*; *Luke 10:20*; *Phil 4:3*; *Rev 3:5*). • For God’s children, **God** as **judge** is the vindicator of his people (cp. *Pss 9:8*; *58:11*; *94:2*; *Isa 11:4*; *Jer 22:16*). • Those who have already died **have now been made perfect** by the sacrifice of Christ (*Heb 10:14*).\n\n
12:24	idm166524					 **Jesus** is the mediator of **the new covenant** (*8:7-13*; *9:11-14*; *10:15-18*). His **sprinkled blood***,* used as the sacrifice for sins, **speaks of forgiveness**. • **The blood of Abel** cried out to God from the ground, demanding **vengeance** for his murder by Cain (*Gen 4:10*). By contrast, Jesus’ blood cries out that the price for sins has been paid for those in the new covenant (*Heb 10:16-18*).\n\n
12:25	idm166542					 As the final warning in the book (see *2:1-4*; *4:12-13*; *6:4-8*; *10:26-31*), this passage plays off the image of God speaking in *12:18-24*.\n\n
12:25	idm166553					 God is **the One who is speaking** his revealed word in his Son, Jesus (*1:1-3*). The author argues from lesser to greater (see *study note on 9:14*): Moses’ warning the people under the old covenant is the lesser situation, and God’s warning us from heaven is the greater situation. If people did not escape judgment when they were warned by Moses, those who reject the message of the Son of God will certainly not escape punishment.\n\n
12:26	idm166562					 **shook the earth:** *Exod 19:18*; *Judg 5:5*; *Pss 68:8*; *77:18*. • **“Once again I will shake not only the earth but the heavens also”:** Quoting *Hag 2:6*, the author emphasizes that **all of creation will be shaken and removed** at the judgment at the end of the age (*1 Cor 7:31*; *2 Pet 3:10*, *12*; *Rev 21:1*).\n\n
12:28	idm166580					 God deserves **holy fear and awe**. • **our God is a devouring fire:** This quotation from *Deut 4:24* speaks at once of God’s awesome power and of his right to judge.\n\n
13:1	idm166589					 This series of practical guidelines is similar to other ethics lists in the New Testament. It describes how to love others in the community of faith, a strong ethical foundation for all of life.\n\n
13:1	idm166595					 **Keep on loving each other as brothers and sisters:** Literally *Continue in brotherly love.* This instruction applies to everyone in the Christian community (see study notes on *2:11*; *3:1*).\n\n
13:2	idm166605					 **Hospitality** is another foundational principle in Jewish and Christian ethics (*1 Pet 4:9*; see also *Matt 10:11*; *Acts 16:15*; *Titus 3:13*; *Phlm 1:22*; *3 Jn 1:5-8*). In the first century, most people did not stay at inns when traveling. • **Some . . . have entertained angels:** See *Gen 18:2-15*; *Judg 13:2-23*.\n\n
13:3	idm166621					 **Remember those in prison:** Prisoners often depended on family members and friends for their most basic needs. Christians were challenged to provide comfort, food, prayer, and other necessities for those imprisoned because of their faith (*13:18-19*; *Matt 25:36*; *Col 4:18*; *2 Tim 1:16*).\n\n
13:4	idm166632					 **Give honor to marriage** means to protect it and hold it as highly valuable. • **Immoral** refers to all sexually illicit behavior. • **Adultery** breaks the marriage vow by engaging in sexual activity outside the marriage relationship.\n\n
13:5	idm166641					 **Don’t love money:** See *1 Tim 6:6-10*. Instead, the believer is to **be satisfied** with what God has provided. Perhaps some in the community were under financial strain (see *Heb 10:32-34*). The promises of God still stand: **“I will never fail you. I will never abandon you”** (see *Deut 31:6*, *8*).\n\n
13:6	idm166654					 This quotation from *Ps 118:6* offers the response of faith: **The** Lord** is my helper***,* so we can **have no fear** of what **people** might do.\n\n
13:7	idm166667					 This middle section of Ch 13 is bracketed by references to the community’s leaders (*13:7*, *17-19*). Rabbis often used this technique, called *inclusio,* in which similar words or phrases were used to mark the beginning and ending of a unit, much as we would use a subheading in a book today. This section hints at several difficulties in the church to which Hebrews was originally addressed.\n\n
13:7	idm166676					 **Remember your leaders:** The word *leaders* was used for military, political, and religious leaders. These leaders, evidently founders of this community, **taught*** . . . ***the word of God** to them—a basic responsibility of those who lead (see *1 Tim 3:2*; *2 Tim 2:15*; *Titus 1:9*). Their **lives** and **faith** were an **example** to **follow**.\n\n
13:8	idm166694					 Though the community was facing new challenges, **Jesus Christ is the same***,* and his Good News does not change. • **yesterday:** Jesus was the Father’s agent in creation (*1:2*, *10*). • **today:** Jesus currently sits at the Father’s right hand (*1:13*; *7:26-28*; *10:12*). He will rule the universe **forever** (*1:8*, *10-12*).\n\n
13:9	idm166712					 Since Jesus does not change (*13:8*), it is unwise for a believer to be **attracted by strange, new ideas**. The false teachings in view seemed to involve **rules about food**. In some branches of Judaism, certain ritual meals were understood as providing God’s grace to those participating. Some in the community might have been tempted to abandon the Christian community by participating in Jewish fellowship meals. These Jewish meals at times encouraged participants to focus on the Jerusalem altar. The author reminds his hearers that **we have an altar** of which those under the old covenant have no part—Christ’s sacrifice (*7:27-28*; *8:13*; *9:11-14*; *10:11-14*).\n\n
13:11	idm166726					 The author describes the sacrifice on the Day of Atonement (*Lev 16:1-28*), in which **animals were burned outside the camp** (*Lev 16:27*). By analogy, **Jesus suffered and died outside the city gates** of Jerusalem. He was the supreme Day of Atonement sacrifice (*Heb 9:11-14*, *24-28*; *10:1-4*).\n\n
13:13	idm166739					 **let us go out to him, outside the camp:** We should stand with Jesus, identifying with him and rejecting the apparent safety and comfort of standing with the world against him. In standing with Christ, we **bear the disgrace he bore** (*6:5-6*; *12:1-3*).\n\n
13:14	idm166749					 Like Abraham’s family (*11:9-16*), we are not ultimately invested in the **world**, for it **is not our permanent home**. We are looking for **a home yet to come***,* the heavenly city of Jerusalem (*12:22*).\n\n
13:15	idm166761					 In light of Jesus’ decisive, sacrificial work on our behalf, we still have **sacrifices** to offer: **praise** and obedience. Because Christ has eradicated the sacrificial system of the old covenant through the sacrifice of himself (*7:27-28*; *8:13*; *9:11-14*; *10:11-14*), **these are the sacrifices that please God**.\n\n
13:15	idm166774					 **sacrifice of praise:** This probably refers to a peace offering (*Lev 7:11-14*). The person bringing the offering had to be made ritually clean before the offering could be made. Our thank offering to God can be **continual** because Jesus has made us clean for all time. When we give thanks to Jesus continually, we are **proclaiming our allegiance to his name**.\n\n
13:16	idm166784					 **to do good and to share with those in need:** These are basic Christian **sacrifices** (*6:10*; *10:24*, *34*; *13:1-3*); they characterize life in the Christian community.\n\n
13:17	idm166796					 The relationship between the **spiritual leaders** and the members of the church may have been strained, so the author exhorts the members to **obey** them **and do what they say**. • The Greek word translated *obey* can also mean *follow, place confidence in,* or *be persuaded by.* • Christian leaders **watch over** people’s **souls** (*Acts 20:28-31*; *1 Pet 5:1-4*), a role that carries grave responsibility, making them **accountable to God** (*Jas 3:1*). • The word **sorrow** could be translated *groaning;* it speaks of emotional burden and stress. Having leaders who are stressed and burdened because of an unruly church does not **benefit** the church.\n\n
13:18	idm166817					 **Pray for us:** The author asks for prayer for himself using the “authorial plural” (see also *5:11*; *6:9*). • **our conscience is clear:** Cp. *2 Cor 1:11-12*; *4:2*.\n\n
13:20	idm166829					 Benedictions were an important element of letters, speeches, and sermons. The author of Hebrews weaves a number of important themes from the book into his benediction. • The image of **our Lord Jesus** as **the great Shepherd of the sheep** (cp. *Ps 23*) communicates God’s provision for and protection of his people (see also *John 10:11-18*; *1 Pet 2:25*) and is specifically tied here to **an eternal covenant**.\n\n
13:22	idm166841					 **this brief exhortation:** This probably indicates that Hebrews was a sermon (cp. the same term in *Acts 13:14-15*, translated “encouragement”).\n\n
13:23	idm166849					 This **Timothy** may have been Paul’s traveling companion (see “*Timothy*” Profile); if so, his imprisonment is not mentioned elsewhere in the New Testament. He clearly knows the author and the recipients of this letter.\n\n
13:24	idm166857					 The book closes with a formal greeting and a blessing. • **The believers from Italy:** The author is probably writing back to Rome from elsewhere in the Mediterranean world; some scholars, however, have thought that the author was writing from Rome.\n\n
