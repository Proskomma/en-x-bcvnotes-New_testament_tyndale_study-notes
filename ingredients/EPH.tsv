1:1	idm155674					 Paul follows the normal pattern of ancient Greek letters: He begins with a few words about himself followed by greetings. He expands this pattern in a Christian way by referring to his divine calling as an **apostle***,* by describing his recipients as **God’s holy people** and as **faithful followers** of Christ, and by his invocation of **grace and peace**.\n\n
1:1	idm155685					 The frequent emphasis on **the will of God** (see *1:5*, *9*, *11*; *5:17*; *6:6*) underscores God’s sovereignty in fulfilling his plan. • **God’s holy people:** Literally *the holy ones*, who are dedicated to God (see also *1:15*, *18*; *2:19*; *3:8*, *18*; *4:12*; *5:3*; *6:18*). • The most ancient manuscripts do not include **in Ephesus***,* and there are no personal greetings in this letter. Many scholars believe that the letter was originally sent to be circulated to a number of churches in the area rather than to the church in Ephesus alone.\n\n
1:2	idm155709					 Paul usually invokes God’s **grace and peace** on those to whom he is writing. **Grace** is undeserved blessing that comes from God’s kindness; **peace** is a sense of well-being and contentedness rooted in the Good News and brought about by the Holy Spirit (see *Gal 5:22*). Both are gifts from **God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ** (see *Rom 5:1-2*).\n\n
1:3	idm155721					 Ephesians is divided into two sections: Chs *1–3* praise God for his amazing grace, and chs *4–6* instruct believers on how to live in grateful response.\n\n
1:3	idm155729					 Paul praises God for all the spiritual blessings he has graciously provided through Jesus Christ, for Gentiles as well as for Jews. • This section is a single, complex sentence in Greek—one of the longest in Paul’s letters, with long sentences being typical of Paul’s writing (also in *1:15-23*; *2:1-7*, *14-16*; *3:1-12*, *14-19*; *Col 1:3-29*; *2:1-3*, *8-15*). The interwoven nature of these sentences reflects the interconnectedness of their ideas.\n\n
1:3	idm155743					 Paul describes **every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms** in *1:4-8*, *13-14*. Paul’s focus is not on physical blessings, but on what God has done through **Christ** to bring people into a saving relationship with himself.\n\n
1:4	idm155753					 God’s people are **holy and without fault in his eyes** because they trust in Christ’s atoning sacrifice for their sins (see *1:7*; *5:25-27*; *Col 1:22*; *Titus 3:5-7*; *Jude 1:24*).\n\n
1:5	idm155765					 **God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family:** By his sovereign initiative, God embraces and blesses as his children those who trust in Christ. They become heirs to all the promises God has made to his people (see *1:11*, *14*; *2:19*; *Rom 8:15-17*, *29-30*; *Gal 4:5*).\n\n
1:6	idm155778					 Believers **praise God***,* who has richly blessed them with his forgiving **grace**. • **his dear Son:** Literally *the beloved,* a Messianic title for Jesus; see *Matt 3:17*; *17:5*; *Col 1:13*.\n\n
1:7	idm155792					 **he purchased our freedom with the blood of his Son:** Believers, who were once prisoners of sin, are free from God’s judgment and from bondage to sin because of Christ’s sacrificial death (see *1:14*; *4:30*; *Rom 3:24*; *1 Cor 6:20*; *Col 1:14*; cp. *Matt 26:28*; *Mark 10:45*; *Heb 9:11-12*, *26*; *1 Pet 1:18-19*).\n\n
1:8	idm155809					 **Wisdom and understanding** come from the revelation of God’s **mysterious will regarding Christ**. In Paul’s writings, *mysterious will* (traditionally *mystery*) often refers to a divine truth formerly hidden but now revealed in the Good News (see *3:9*). Here it refers to how God **will bring everything together under the authority of Christ***,* so that he may be universally recognized and respected as Lord (see *Phil 2:9-11*; *Col 1:16-20*, *26-27*; *2:2*, *19*; *4:3*). Ephesians focuses specifically on the inclusion of Gentiles as well as Jews in God’s redeemed people (see *Eph 3:3-6*; *6:19*; cp. *Rom 16:25-26*).\n\n
1:11	idm155831					 **we have received an inheritance from God:** Paul often talks about salvation as an *inheritance,* something promised to our spiritual ancestors and received by us (see *Rom 8:17*; *Gal 3:29*; *4:7*; *Col 1:12*; *3:24*). • Because God is sovereign, **he makes everything work out according to his plan** (cp. *Rom 8:28-30*).\n\n
1:12	idm155846					 **we Jews . . . you Gentiles:** Literally *we . . . you;* the reference to *Jews* and *Gentiles* is implied.\n\n
1:13	idm155856					 **he identified you as his own** (or *he put his seal on you*): Just as a *seal* signifies authentic ownership, the **Holy Spirit** in a believer’s life signifies God’s ownership (*4:30*; *2 Cor 1:22*).\n\n
1:14	idm155868					 **The Spirit is** both **God’s guarantee** of future blessings and a foretaste of eternal life and power. The believer’s eternal **inheritance** includes everything **he promised** (see also *1:18*; *Rom 8:17*; *2 Cor 1:22*; *5:5*; *Gal 3:29*; *4:7*; *Col 1:12*; *3:24*; *Titus 3:7*).\n\n
1:15	idm155887					 Paul prays that his readers may have the spiritual understanding to grasp the full significance of God’s gifts (*1:3-14*).\n\n
1:15	idm155894					 Paul links **faith** in Christ with **love** for God’s people. Personal faith in Christ brings salvation, and salvation is expressed, above all, by a life of love (see *Gal 5:6*; *Col 1:4*; *1 Thes 1:3*; *3:6*; *5:8*; *2 Thes 1:3*; *1 Tim 1:14*; *2:15*; *Titus 2:2*).\n\n
1:17	idm155911					 **spiritual wisdom** (or *the Spirit of wisdom*): The word *spirit* can refer either to the Holy Spirit or to the human spirit. • **Knowledge of God** is to know God personally and experientially, not just to know about him intellectually (see *John 17:3*).\n\n
1:18	idm155922					 **Confident hope** for believers is the anticipation of Christ’s return and his future blessings that they will share. Joined with Christ, believers become joint heirs with him of all God’s promised blessings.\n\n
1:19	idm155929					 **God’s power for us who believe him** is the power of his Spirit at work in and through his people, because they are joined to the resurrected Christ (see *Rom 6:4-14*; *Col 2:12*). Paul longed to experience the power of Christ’s resurrection in his own life (*Phil 3:10*). • In biblical times, **the place of honor** was always at a person’s **right hand** (*Ps 110:1*; *Acts 7:56*).\n\n
1:21	idm155943					 **he is far above:** Jesus’ power and authority transcend all rival powers, whether human or spiritual, in this age and the coming age (see *3:10*; *6:12*; *John 12:31*; *Rom 8:38-39*; *1 Cor 15:24*; *Col 1:13*; *2:10*, *15*; *1 Pet 3:22*; *Rev 12:7-9*).\n\n
1:22	idm155960					 **under the authority of Christ** (literally *under his feet*): In pictures from the ancient Near East, victorious kings have their feet on the necks of their defeated enemies. Paul is graphically picturing the way Christ has defeated all his enemies and reigns as king of all things (see *Ps 110:1*; *1 Cor 15:25-28*).\n\n
1:23	idm155970					 **it is made full and complete by Christ, who fills all things everywhere with himself** (or *it is the full expression of the one who fills everything everywhere*): This difficult phrase probably means that the church, as **his body***,* is the full expression of Christ in this world. His presence, which fills the entire universe (*4:10*), is reflected in and works through his body.\n\n
2:1	idm155981					 Paul reflects on the terrible situation of the believers before they believed in Christ and the grace of God that has spared them.\n\n
2:1	idm155987					 Paul’s readers were once like **dead** people before God (see *2:5*; *Col 2:13*). Because of their **disobedience** and **sins***,* driven by the power of the **devil***,* they were condemned along with **the rest of the world** to suffer God’s judgment.\n\n
2:2	idm156002					 Human **sin** results from our being governed by **the devil***,* the **spirit** who rules both the **powers** of evil in the spiritual realm (see *1:21*; *6:11-12*; cp. *Col 1:13*) and human beings **who refuse to obey God** (*2 Cor 4:4*; contrast *Rom 8:2-14*; *Gal 5:22-23*).\n\n
2:3	idm156020					 Unconverted people are naturally under the control of **the passionate desires and inclinations of our sinful nature** (see *Rom 3:9-20*, *23*). Because of their sin, they are **subject to God’s anger***,* because God hates sin (see *Eph 5:6*; *Rom 1:18*; *2:5*, *8*; *3:5*, *19*; *4:15*; *5:9*; *9:22*; *12:19*; *13:4-5*; *Col 3:6*; *1 Thes 1:10*; *2:16*; *5:9*).\n\n
2:4	idm156046					 By God’s **mercy***,* kindness, and love, those who are joined to Jesus Christ are saved from the terrible consequences of their sin and enjoy the benefits of Christ’s resurrection.\n\n
2:5	idm156054					 **gave us life when he raised Christ from the dead** (literally *made us alive together with Christ*): Joined with Christ, believers share in his resurrection, now and in the future (see *2:6*; *Rom 6:4-14*; *Col 3:1-4*). • **It is only by God’s grace that you have been saved:** See *Eph 1:2*; *2:8-9*.\n\n
2:6	idm156068					 **united with Christ Jesus:** Because of this union, believers share God’s glory and blessings, and experience resurrection both now and in the future (see *Rom 6:4-14*; *Col 2:12-13*; *3:1-4*).\n\n
2:7	idm156078					 **grace:** See *study note on 1:2*.\n\n
2:8	idm156086					 This is a concise summary of how a person is **saved**. It is a cardinal tenet of the Good News that people are made righteous through trust in Christ rather than through their own merit (see *Rom 1:16-17*; *3:24-25*; *Gal 2:16*; cp. *John 3:16*, *36*). **Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done** (see *Rom 3:21–4:8*; *9:16*; *Gal 3:2-10*; *5:1-6*; cp. *2 Tim 1:9*; *Titus 3:5*). Salvation is for those who trust Christ alone to save them. As a result, **none of us can boast about it** (cp. *Rom 3:27*; *4:2*; *1 Cor 1:30-31*; *Gal 6:14*).\n\n
2:10	idm156110					 **He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us:** Good works are the result, not the cause, of salvation. God’s Spirit, working through a transformed heart, produces a good life (*Gal 5:22-23*).\n\n
2:11	idm156118					 Paul now focuses on the grace that God has given particularly to **Gentiles** (non-Jews), bringing them into his family and uniting them with Jews in a new, unified, multiethnic community—the body of Christ, the church. Paul’s emphasis on the inclusion of Gentiles might suggest they were experiencing discrimination from Jewish Christians.\n\n
2:11	idm156125					 Traditionally, Jews disdained **Gentiles***,* considering them **“uncircumcised heathens”** who were excluded from God’s people (see *Gen 17:9-14*). Paul argues that judging people by **their bodies and not their hearts** is superficial—in Christ, physical **circumcision** means nothing (see *Rom 2:28-29*).\n\n
2:12	idm156138					 Before their conversion, Gentiles had no part in God’s people or the **covenant promises God had made to them***;* they were **without God and without hope** (see *4:18*; *Col 1:21*).\n\n
2:13	idm156149					 Only by being **united with Christ Jesus** through trust in him can a person be reconciled to God (see *Rom 5:10-12*; *2 Cor 5:18-21*). **The blood of Christ**—his sacrificial death—makes this possible (see *Eph 1:7*; *Rom 3:24-25*; *5:9*; *Col 1:20*; cp. *Heb 9:12-15*; *1 Pet 1:19*; *1 Jn 1:7*; *Rev 1:5*; *5:9*).\n\n
2:14	idm156168					 **Christ himself has brought peace to us:** Peace with God (*2:16-17*; *Rom 5:1*, *10-11*, *18-21*; *Col 1:20-22*) and between **Jews and Gentiles** (see *Eph 2:15-16*; *4:3*). • **the wall of hostility that separated us:** Social and religious practices traditionally divided Jews from Gentiles. A low wall around the Temple in Jerusalem marked the boundary beyond which Gentiles were not allowed to step. It symbolized the distinction Jews drew between themselves and Gentiles.\n\n
2:15	idm156184					 **ending the system of law:** See *Rom 10:4*; *Col 2:14*; cp. *Rom 6:14*; *7:4-6*. • The church is **one new people***,* a community where love and acceptance are prized and ethnic distinctions are no longer a source of division (see *Rom 15:7-12*; *Gal 3:28*; cp. *John 10:16*).\n\n
2:16	idm156200					 Christ’s **death on the cross** reconciles humans to God, and also Jews and Gentiles to each other.\n\n
2:17	idm156207					 **far away . . . near:** This verse possibly alludes to *Isa 57:19*. • The Greek text lacks the words **Gentiles** and **Jews***,* but they are implied (see *Eph 2:13*; see also *study note on 1:12-13*).\n\n
2:18	idm156220					 Because of Christ’s sacrifice for sins, both Jewish and Gentile believers receive the **Holy Spirit***,* which makes it possible for them to approach God openly (see *3:12*; cp. *Acts 10:34-37*, *44-48*; *1 Pet 3:18*).\n\n
2:19	idm156232					 **Gentiles** who believe **are no longer strangers and foreigners** (*2:11-12*, *17*). Through Christ, they are fully accepted into **God’s family**. They become children of God, just like believing Jews (see *Rom 8:14-17*).\n\n
2:20	idm156244					 **Apostles** are missionary evangelists commissioned by God. • Here, the **prophets** appear to be New Testament prophets, not Old Testament ones (see *3:5*; *4:11*; see also *1 Cor 12:10*, *28-29*; *14:1-5*, *22-24*, *29-32*, *39*; cp. *Acts 13:1*; *19:6*; *21:9-10*). In both the Old Testament and New Testament, prophets are not primarily predictors of the future but are empowered to speak a message from God (see *1 Cor 12:10*). • The church is built on the **foundation of the apostles and the prophets** (or *on the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets*)—that is, on their faithful witness to the saving message of Christ (see *Rev 21:14*; cp. *Matt 16:18*). However, **the cornerstone is Christ Jesus himself***,* the Messiah, Savior, and Lord (cp. *1 Cor 3:11*). The cornerstone is the most important stone in a building’s foundation (see *Isa 28:16*; *Mark 12:10*; *Acts 4:11*; *1 Pet 2:6-7*).\n\n
2:21	idm156275					 **Joined together** in Christ, Gentile and Jewish Christians become **a holy temple for the Lord***,* because the Lord himself is among his people (see *Matt 18:20*; *28:20*; *1 Cor 3:16*; *1 Pet 2:4-5*).\n\n
3:1	idm156288					 Paul now describes his own role in God’s eternal plan: to proclaim God’s grace to the Gentiles.\n\n
3:1	idm156294					 **When I think of all this:** Paul has written about the amazing salvation that God’s grace has brought to undeserving sinners who are under his judgment, and about the incredible revelation that Gentiles can also be included in God’s new family, the people of God (chs *1–2*). • **a prisoner of Christ Jesus:** Paul wrote this letter while imprisoned for his witness to Christ among the Gentiles.\n\n
3:2	idm156303					 Paul interrupts his thought in *3:1* to discuss his own role in God’s plan. When Paul was first converted, he was given **the special responsibility of extending** God’s **grace to** the **Gentiles** (see *Acts 9:15-16*; *22:14-15*, *21*; *26:17-18*; *Rom 1:5*; *11:13-14*; *15:15-18*; *Gal 1:15-16*; *2:7-9*; *Col 1:25-27*; *1 Tim 2:7*; *2 Tim 4:17*).\n\n
3:3	idm156325					 What Paul **briefly wrote earlier** is a reference either to *1:9-10* (cp. *2:11-22*) or to an unknown letter. • Paul’s understanding of God’s **mysterious plan** (see *study note on 1:8-10*) came as **God himself revealed** it to him (see *1:9-10*; *Gal 1:11-12*, *15-17*; cp. *Acts 9:3-6*; *1 Cor 12:1*, *7*; *Gal 2:2*).\n\n
3:5	idm156344					 **his holy apostles:** See *1:1*. • The order of the terms **apostles and prophets** (see *2:20*) suggests that Paul is speaking of New Testament, not Old Testament, **prophets**. In both the Old Testament and the New Testament, the gift of prophecy is concerned less with predicting the future than with speaking a special word from God (see *1 Cor 12:10*).\n\n
3:6	idm156356					 **God’s plan** that has now been revealed to Paul is that the **Gentiles** are now included in God’s family, the **body** of Christ, just as **Jews** are. They **share equally** in God’s eternal blessings.\n\n
3:7	idm156367					 **grace:** See *study note on 1:2*. • **serving him:** Paul speaks of himself as a servant of the **Good News** (see also *Col 1:23*), of God (*1 Cor 3:5*; *2 Cor 6:4*), of Christ (*2 Cor 11:23*), of the church (*Col 1:25*), and of the new covenant (*2 Cor 3:6*).\n\n
3:8	idm156383					 Paul considered himself **the least deserving of all God’s people** (literally *the least of God’s people*) because he was once an ardent persecutor of believers (see *1 Cor 15:9*; *1 Tim 1:12-16*). • **the endless treasures available to them in Christ:** See *Eph 1:3-14*.\n\n
3:10	idm156395					 **The church** is meant to showcase to the entire universe God’s **wisdom in its rich variety***,* as expressed in his plan of redemption (see *Rom 11:33-36*). • **the unseen rulers and authorities in the heavenly places:** See *Eph 1:21* and *corresponding study note*.\n\n
3:12	idm156408					 **We can come boldly and confidently into God’s presence***,* not because of good deeds that we have done, but because of Christ’s all-sufficient sacrifice for our sins (see *2:18*; *Heb 4:14-16*; *10:19-23*; *1 Pet 3:18*; *1 Jn 4:14*).\n\n
3:13	idm156421					 **my trials here:** Paul is writing from jail, as a prisoner (see *3:1*). He knows that **suffering** is to be expected and that it works for good in a believer’s life (see *Rom 5:3-5*; *Col 1:24*; *1 Thes 3:3*; *2 Tim 3:12*; *Jas 1:2-4*).\n\n
3:14	idm156435					 Paul closes this section (*1:3–3:21*) with a second prayer for his readers. The first (*1:15-23*) was for their spiritual understanding, the second (*3:14-21*) is for their spiritual growth and empowerment.\n\n
3:14	idm156444					 **When I think of all this, I fall to my knees and pray:** Paul resumes what he started to say at the beginning of the chapter (see *3:1*).\n\n
3:15	idm156452					 **the Creator of everything in heaven and on earth** (or *from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name*): There is a play on words between *Father* (Greek patēr*,* *3:14*) and *family* (Greek patria). God is the Creator of everything, including every family—angelic or human, Gentile or Jew (see *2:14-22*; *3:6*). So he is the source of **glorious, unlimited resources** that he gladly gives his children.\n\n
3:17	idm156469					 Having **Christ** . . . **make his home in your hearts** is the source of spiritual power for life and ministry (see *John 14:16-17*, *23*; *15:4-5*; *Gal 2:20*).\n\n
3:18	idm156481					 **how wide, how long, how high, and how deep his love is:** Christ’s love is great in every dimension (cp. *Rom 8:38-39*).\n\n
3:19	idm156489					 **May you experience** (literally *know*) **the love of Christ:** The whole Christian life is based on the experience and personal knowledge of God’s grace and love in Jesus Christ (see *Rom 12:1*). • **it is too great to understand fully:** Christ’s love is much greater than ordinary human love (see *Rom 5:6-8*). • The believer’s life is **made complete** when it is filled **with all the fullness of life and power** by the presence of Christ within (see *Eph 1:23*; *Gal 2:20*; *Col 1:27*). The believer then is conformed to his image and reflects God (see *Eph 4:14*, *24*; *5:1-2*; *Rom 8:29*; *2 Cor 3:16-18*).\n\n
3:20	idm156511					 This doxology concludes the first section of the letter (see also *Rom 16:25-27*; *Gal 1:5*; *1 Tim 1:17*; *2 Tim 4:18*; *Jude 1:24-25*).\n\n
3:20	idm156522					 **all glory to God:** Because of the grace God has shown in Jesus Christ, he deserves nothing less. • The **mighty power at work within us** is the power of the living God that raised Christ from the dead (see *1:19-20*). By that power, he is able **to accomplish infinitely more than we might ask or think***,* because God is at work in the lives of his children (see *Rom 8:31-39*; *Phil 4:13*; *Col 1:29*).\n\n
3:21	idm156536					 **The church**—the community of believers, both Jews and Gentiles—is to be the reflection and full expression of the **glory** of God.\n\n
4:1	idm156544					 **Therefore:** Ephesians divides into two sections, the first devoted to explaining the Good News, the second to drawing out the implications for Christian living. This arrangement reflects Paul’s belief that believers’ lives should be a response of gratitude for God’s grace.\n\n
4:1	idm156551					 God’s saving grace for both Jews and Gentiles should be reflected in how the two groups relate to each other in the church: They are to accept each other warmly, just as God has accepted them.\n\n
4:1	idm156557					 **I, a prisoner for serving the Lord:** See *study note on 3:1*. • Though salvation can never be earned, believers are to live in a manner **worthy** of their **calling** to salvation (see *Phil 1:27*; *Col 1:10*; *1 Thes 2:12*). • **called by God:** See *Eph 1:4-5*, *11*.\n\n
4:2	idm156573					 **humble . . . gentle . . . patient:** Believers are to be like Christ in how they treat others (see *Col 3:12-14*; cp. *Gal 6:2*).\n\n
4:3	idm156582					 **binding yourselves together with peace:** Paul’s emphasis on God’s acceptance of Gentiles as well as Jews (*2:11–3:6*) is now applied ethically: Jews and Gentiles are to accept one another in the church (see *Col 3:14-15*).\n\n
4:4	idm156591					 These three verses might have been taken from a creedal statement. • Whatever their ethnic differences, Jewish and Gentile Christians share **one Lord** and **one faith***,* so they should live together in unity. • Christ’s **one body** is the church (see *1:23*; *2:16*). • **One God and Father of all:** See *1 Cor 8:6*; *15:28*. • **in all, and living through all:** God is especially present in believers’ lives (see *1 Cor 6:19*; *2 Cor 13:5*; *Gal 2:20*; *Col 1:27*; cp. *John 14:16-17*, *23*; *15:4-5*).\n\n
4:7	idm156614					 Though believers share a common faith, God has given different special abilities to **each** individual believer for building up the church.\n\n
4:7	idm156621					 **He has given each one of us** a gift of his **grace** for building up the community of believers (see *1 Cor 12:7*; cp. *Rom 12:6*; *1 Cor 12:11*).\n\n
4:8	idm156632					 **He led a crowd of captives** may refer to Christ’s victory over spiritual powers (see *1:21-22*; *Col 2:15*), or to his capture of disobedient sinners and making them believers through the power of the Good News message. • Christ **gave gifts to his people** (see *Eph 4:11-12*).\n\n
4:9	idm156643					 **to our lowly world** (or *to the lowest parts of the earth*): Some understand this phrase as referring to the tomb, to the world of the dead (cp. *Matt 12:40*; *1 Pet 3:18-20*), or to the coming of the Spirit at Pentecost. Instead, it probably refers to the incarnation, when **Christ** . . . **descended** from heaven and became a man (see *John 1:14*; *3:13*; *Phil 2:7-8*).\n\n
4:11	idm156658					 In his letters, Paul has four different lists of God’s gifts (see also *Rom 12:4-8*; *1 Cor 12:8-10*, *28*), none of which is comprehensive. Here the focus is on the gifts of leadership most needed for the growth of the church. • **Apostles** are divinely commissioned missionary evangelists. • **Prophets** speak messages from God for his people. • **Evangelists** proclaim the Good News. • **Pastors** (literally *shepherds*) care for God’s people (see *1 Tim 3:1-7*). • **Teachers** expound Scripture and God’s truths to the church. • **Pastors and teachers** might refer to separate ministries or to two aspects of the same ministry.\n\n
4:12	idm156675					 God’s gifts are given so that believers will **build up the church** (see *1 Cor 12:7*; cp. *1 Pet 2:5*). • **to equip God’s people to do his work:** All believers are called to active Christian service.\n\n
4:13	idm156685					 The goal of ministry is for the whole Christian community to understand and experience the Christian **faith** more deeply and gain a deeper **knowledge of God’s Son**. In this way, believers will be **mature in the Lord** (see *1 Cor 2:6*; *14:20*; *Phil 3:15*; *Col 1:28*; *4:12*; cp. *Heb 5:14*; *Jas 1:4*; *3:2*). The **standard** of maturity is **Christ** himself; the Spirit’s transforming work is to make people fully like Christ (*Rom 8:29*).\n\n
4:14	idm156705					 **We won’t be tossed and blown about:** Mature Christians, with a well-grounded knowledge of the Good News and of Christ himself, will be able to discern and resist false **teaching** (see *Gal 1:6-7*; *3:1*; *Col 2:8-23*; *1 Tim 1:3-7*; *4:1-3*; *6:3-5*, *20*; *2 Tim 4:3-4*; *Titus 1:11*).\n\n
4:16	idm156722					 **Each part** of the **body** plays an important role and **helps the other parts grow**. Christ, the head of the body, works through the individual parts, **makes** them **fit together***,* and is the ultimate source of growth (see *Col 2:19*). • When all believers are ministering effectively, **the whole body** will be **healthy and growing and full of love** (cp. *1 Cor 8:1*). Love is the most important factor in Christian growth (*1 Cor 13:1-13*).\n\n
4:17	idm156739					 Paul gives believers specific guidelines for living a new life in Christ.\n\n
4:17	idm156745					 God’s people are called to a way of life that is different from that of **the Gentiles** (pagans, unbelievers) of the world.\n\n
4:18	idm156752					 **Their minds are full of darkness** because their **minds** are **closed** and **hearts** are hard (see *2 Cor 4:4*).\n\n
4:19	idm156763					 **no sense of shame:** The hardness of unbelievers’ hearts is reflected in their moral insensitivity and sexual immorality (see *Rom 1:21-31*).\n\n
4:20	idm156771					 **What you learned about Christ** is **the truth that comes from him**. He gives true understanding (cp. *John 14:6*) and calls his people to an entirely new way of life (cp. *Rom 6:3-14*; *13:12-14*; *Col 3:8-10*).\n\n
4:24	idm156783					 A believer has a **new nature:** God’s Spirit expresses his life within the believer (see *Col 3:10*; cp. *Gen 1:26*; *Rom 12:1-2*; *Gal 5:22-23*). The transforming work of God’s Spirit is part of the gift of salvation (*Eph 2:8-10*).\n\n
4:25	idm156795					 **Let us tell our neighbors the truth:** Cp. *Zech 8:16*. • **for we are all parts of the same body:** See *Rom 12:5*; *1 Cor 12:12-13*, *27*.\n\n
4:26	idm156807					 **“don’t sin by letting anger control you”** (literally *“be angry and do not sin”*): This verse quotes *Ps 4:4*. The literal form of the quotation cannot be used to justify anger, **for anger gives a foothold to the devil** (cp. *Jas 1:20*). God’s people are to be gentle and gracious, not harsh or angry (see *Eph 4:31-32*). • **Don’t let the sun go down while you are still angry:** Anger must quickly be resolved, not allowed to stew.\n\n
4:28	idm156820					 Christians are to be hard-working people who have integrity and care for others (cp. *1 Thes 4:11*; *2 Thes 3:6-12*).\n\n
4:29	idm156828					 Believers are to learn new patterns of speech to **be an encouragement** to others (see also *5:3-4*, *12*).\n\n
4:30	idm156837					 Believers must not alienate **God’s Holy Spirit***,* who identifies them as belonging to God (cp. *Mark 3:29*; *Acts 5:3-5*, *9*; *1 Thes 4:8*; *Heb 6:4-8*). • **has identified you as his own** (or *has put his seal on you*): The presence of the Spirit both confirms and guarantees the future redemption of believers (see *Eph 1:13-14*; *Rom 8:16-17*; *2 Cor 1:22*; *1 Jn 4:13*).\n\n
4:32	idm156856					 **Forgiving** fellow believers is a natural and good response to experiencing God’s forgiving grace in Christ (cp. *Col 3:12-13*; *1 Jn 4:19*).\n\n
5:1	idm156865					 **Imitate God . . . in everything you do:** Primarily by expressing love (*5:2*; cp. *Matt 5:44-45*, *48*). • **because you are his dear children:** Just as children follow their parents’ example, believers should follow God’s example (*1 Cor 4:14-17*).\n\n
5:2	idm156877					 Christ’s **love** is shown especially in his offering himself **as a sacrifice for us** (cp. *5:25*; *John 15:13*; *Rom 5:8*). Christian love is motivated by and modeled after Christ’s sacrificial love (see *Phil 2:5-8*). • Paul draws on Old Testament imagery, where the smell of a burning *sacrifice* was **a pleasing aroma to God** (see *Lev 1:9*; *2:2*; cp. *Rom 12:1*).\n\n
5:3	idm156894					 **God’s people** (literally *holy ones*) must have a holy lifestyle, avoiding the immorality common among unbelievers (cp. *4:19*; *Col 3:5*).\n\n
5:4	idm156904					 The speech of God’s people is to be characterized by **thankfulness to God** (see *4:29*; *5:3*, *12*).\n\n
5:5	idm156914					 Many similar statements describe the kind of **person** who will not **inherit the Kingdom of** . . . **God:** See *1 Cor 6:9-10*; *Gal 5:19-21*; *Rev 22:15*; cp. *Col 3:5-6*. • **For a greedy person is an idolater:** The things greedy people desire become their gods (see *Matt 6:24*).\n\n
5:6	idm156929					 **The anger of God will fall** at his final judgment (see *Rom 1:18*; *Col 3:5-6*; cp. *John 3:36*).\n\n
5:7	idm156939					 **Don’t participate:** Cp. *2 Cor 6:14–7:1*.\n\n
5:8	idm156947					 **Darkness** is ignorance of God and his ways and being dominated by sin (see *4:18*). • **Light from the Lord** is Christ’s good news (see *John 8:12*). **As people of light***,* believers live in fellowship with God, in whom there is no darkness (see *1 Jn 1:5-7*; *5:9**;* cp. *Matt 5:14-16*; *John 8:12*; *12:35-36*, *46*; *Rom 13:12*; *2 Cor 6:14*; *1 Thes 5:4-8*; *1 Pet 2:9*).\n\n
5:9	idm156970					 God’s people are to do **what is good and right and true***,* in harmony with God’s **light** (cp. *Rom 12:2*; some early manuscripts read *Spirit* instead of *light;* cp. *Eph 4:22-24*; *Matt 7:16-20*; *Gal 5:22-23*).\n\n
5:10	idm156985					 **Carefully determine what pleases the Lord:** The point is to obey God’s will, not simply to understand it (cp. *Rom 12:2*; *Phil 1:10*).\n\n
5:11	idm156994					 **expose them:** By the light shining from their lives (cp. *John 3:20-21*; *Rom 13:12*; *1 Pet 2:9*), not by verbally accusing or condemning people (see *1 Cor 5:9-13*).\n\n
5:13	idm157005					 **“Awake, O sleeper”:** This might be a fragment from an unknown Christian song, perhaps based on texts in Isaiah (cp. *Isa 26:19*; *52:1*; *60:1*). It calls on God’s people to turn from their sinful darkness and live in the full **light** of **Christ**.\n\n
5:15	idm157017					 **Fools** have no understanding of God and his ways, but **those who are wise** do know God and understand his ways (see *Job 28:28*; *Prov 1:7*; *2:1-22*).\n\n
5:16	idm157028					 **Make the most of every opportunity:** See also *Col 4:5*. • **in these evil days:** See *Matt 24:6-12*, *15-22*; *2 Thes 2:3-10*.\n\n
5:18	idm157040					 **The Holy Spirit***,* not **wine***,* should dominate believers’ lives (see *Prov 23:29-35*; cp. *Acts 2:15-18*). • **be filled:** The grammar here suggests that believers’ lives are to be continuously filled with and governed by the Holy Spirit.\n\n
5:19	idm157053					 Lives filled with the Holy Spirit will be expressed in **singing** . . . **and making music** (*Col 3:16-17*). Joyful praise, worship, and giving **thanks** are fitting responses to God’s saving grace. • **among yourselves:** Singing together builds up the body of Christ. • The **Lord** hears the **music** in our **hearts**. • **in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ:** Jesus Christ is our mediator and representative as we approach God (cp. *John 14:13-14*; *16:23-27*; *Rev 22:4*).\n\n
5:21	idm157071					 Paul gives specific instructions on how believers are to relate to one another in a Christian home (see also *Col 3:18–4:1*; *1 Pet 2:18–3:7*). Love and respect are to characterize all relationships in the body of Christ as an expression of believers’ commitment to the Lord himself.\n\n
5:21	idm157079					 **And further, submit to one another:** The verb form links it with the command to *be filled* (*5:18*). This general instruction (cp. *Phil 2:3*) applies to all three relationships that Paul discusses: wives and husbands (*Eph 5:22-33*), children and their parents (*6:1-4*), and slaves and their masters (*6:5-9*). For believers, submission is not expressed out of fear or desire for personal gain, but **out of reverence for Christ**.\n\n
5:22	idm157093					 Christian **wives** are to **submit** to their **husbands***,* showing them respect. Equally important, Christian **husbands** are to **love** their **wives** (see *Col 3:18-19*). Christian marriages become a reflection of the union and relationship between the Lord and the church.\n\n
5:22	idm157107					 Submission is part of the life to which the wives’ Christian commitment calls them (see *1 Cor 11:3-10*; *14:34-35*; *Col 3:18*; *1 Tim 2:11-12*; *Titus 2:5*; *1 Pet 3:1-6*).\n\n
5:23	idm157119					 **a husband is the head of his wife:** To be the head is to have authority (see *1 Cor 11:3*). • **Christ is the head of the church:** See *Eph 1:22*; *4:15*; *Col 1:18*; *2:10*, *19*.\n\n
5:25	idm157133					 Christian husbands are to love their wives **just as Christ loved the church**—that is, sacrificially, for Christ **gave up his life for her** (*5:2*; cp. *Col 3:19*; *1 Pet 3:7*).\n\n
5:26	idm157144					 **washed by the cleansing of God’s word:** The church has been cleansed by the message of good news. God has forgiven the sins of his people through Christ’s sacrificial death (*John 15:3*; cp. *Titus 3:5*; *1 Pet 3:21*).\n\n
5:27	idm157154					 **a glorious church without a . . . blemish:** The church’s sins have been forgiven through Christ’s sacrifice, and her life is purified by the Holy Spirit. As a result, the church stands **holy and without fault** before God. Cp. *1:4*; *2 Cor 11:2*; *Col 1:22*; *Rev 19:7-8*; *21:2*.\n\n
5:28	idm157167					 Husbands should prize and cherish their wives, for in marriage the two have become one (see *5:31*).\n\n
5:31	idm157174					 The unity of husband and wife should motivate the husband to care for his wife.\n\n
5:32	idm157180					 **it is an illustration: **Both the unity of husband and wife and the unity of **Christ and the church** are **a great mystery** (see *study note on 1:8-10*).\n\n
5:33	idm157190					 Paul summarizes his teaching on the relationship between husbands and wives (*5:22-33*). Christian marriages should be marked by **love** and **respect**.\n\n
6:1	idm157199					 The relationship between parents and children is to be a reflection of their devotion to the Lord. Christian children are to obey their parents, and Christian parents are to discipline their children gently (see *Col 3:20-21*).\n\n
6:2	idm157206					 Children who honor and respect their parents also honor and respect God himself, and blessings follow.\n\n
6:4	idm157212					 **Fathers** can often **provoke** their **children to anger** by being harsh or unjust (see *Col 3:21*). Parents should give their children **the discipline and instruction that comes from the Lord** (or *the discipline and instruction about the Lord*) so that they will learn a way of living that is good and pleases God. Such discipline is not to be excessive, but loving and gentle, so that children are not turned from the Lord but are drawn to him (cp. *Heb 12:5-11*).\n\n
6:5	idm157225					 The relationship between slaves and masters (and, by analogy, between employees and employers) is to be shaped by their commitment to the Lord and their desire to build one another up in Christ. Christian slaves are to obey their masters, and Christian masters are to treat their slaves kindly (see *Col 3:22–4:1*). • Paul was not promoting slavery but teaching Christians how to live in it as a fact of life in that culture (for Paul’s treatment of slavery, see *Philemon Book Introduction*, “Meaning and Message”).\n\n
6:5	idm157233					 Obedient service to **earthly masters** expresses a Christian slave’s service to **Christ** (see *Col 3:22-23*; *1 Tim 6:1-2*; *Titus 2:9-10*; *1 Pet 2:18-23*).\n\n
6:6	idm157245					 **As slaves of Christ:** As those who have been bought by the blood of Christ, believers no longer belong to themselves (see *1 Cor 6:19-20*; *7:22*; cp. *Rom 1:1*; *Gal 1:10*; *Phil 1:1*). For Christian slaves, **the will of God** is that they honor him by serving their human masters faithfully and **with enthusiasm**.\n\n
6:8	idm157259					 The master of all believers is **the Lord***,* and he **will reward **those who are faithful (see *1 Cor 3:12-15*).\n\n
6:9	idm157269					 **in the same way:** That is, with integrity and concern for their welfare (see *Col 4:1*). • **Don’t threaten them:** Christian masters, too, will be held accountable by **the same Master in heaven** for their lives on earth. Pleasing him requires treating their slaves humanely and kindly. • **he has no favorites:** God judges all people by the same standard (see *Deut 10:17*; *Acts 10:34*; *Rom 2:11*; *Col 3:25*).\n\n
6:10	idm157284					 Paul’s **final word** is to remind the believers of the devil’s opposition and urge them to protect themselves with **all of God’s armor**.\n\n
6:11	idm157292					 **Put on all of God’s armor:** See *Rom 13:12*; *2 Cor 10:4-5*. It is only by the Lord’s protection that a believer can **stand firm against all strategies of the devil** (cp. *1 Pet 5:8-9*).\n\n
6:12	idm157303					 Believers should not consider human beings to be their **enemies**. Instead, the opposition they face comes from the **unseen world** of spiritual evil, and Christ has authority over that realm (see *1:21-22*).\n\n
6:13	idm157312					 **God’s armor** gives believers the ability to **resist** the attacks of the devil **in the time of evil**—when evil seems to prevail—and to keep **standing firm**.\n\n
6:14	idm157322					 Paul uses the physical armor worn by Roman soldiers as imagery for spiritual armor used by believers. Most of this equipment is to defend, not to attack. Paul’s focus is not on the precise functions of each piece but on God’s gifts. Grounding in Christ and Scripture provides protection and ability to **stand your ground** (cp. *Jas 4:7*; *1 Pet 5:8-9*).\n\n
6:14	idm157331					 **God’s righteousness:** Either the righteousness God credits to those who believe in Christ, or the righteous way of life brought about by the transforming work of the Spirit of God in believers’ lives. The one implies the other.\n\n
6:15	idm157338					 **For shoes, put on the peace that comes from the Good News:** In this context, the focus is on letting one’s life be governed by the peace that the Good News gives (see *Rom 5:1*).\n\n
6:16	idm157346					 **Faith** is trust in Christ as Savior or trust in God to meet one’s needs in evil times. • **fiery arrows:** Paul graphically pictures the nature of temptation to sin (cp. *Matt 6:13*; *26:41*; *1 Cor 10:13*; *Jas 1:12-15*). Arrows were sometimes dipped in pitch and ignited before being shot.\n\n
6:17	idm157358					 **Put on salvation as your helmet:** Protect the mind with the assurance that God has indeed saved and given eternal life to those who believe in Christ. • **The sword of the Spirit** pictures using **the word of God** to respond to an attack, either with the Good News or with the spoken or written word of God more generally (cp. *Jer 23:29*; *Heb 4:12*).\n\n
6:18	idm157369					 Paul contrasts purely mental prayer with prayer **in the Spirit***,* prayer that arises from the Spirit of God within (see *1 Cor 14:15*; *Jude 1:20*; cp. *Rom 8:26-27*). • **at all times and on every occasion:** Believers are to make prayer a way of life and turn the whole of life into prayer (see *Phil 4:6-7*; *1 Thes 5:17*)—not simply for themselves, but **for all believers everywhere**. • **Stay alert and be persistent:** Because the danger of the devil is constant.\n\n
6:19	idm157385					 Paul’s missionary calling was primarily to help Gentiles realize that they are now accepted by God and welcomed into his church. • **mysterious plan:** See study notes on *1:8-10*; *3:3*. • **I am in chains now:** Though writing as a prisoner (see *3:1*; *4:1*), Paul knew that his calling as **God’s ambassador** (cp. *2 Cor 5:20*) was to **keep on speaking boldly for him**.\n\n
6:21	idm157400					 Paul closes with some personal words and a benediction that repeats the desires expressed at the beginning of the letter.\n\n
6:23	idm157406					 **Peace . . . love . . . faithfulness . . . grace:** These qualities, highlighted at the beginning of the letter (*1:2*, *15*), are what Paul most desired for believers. • **dear brothers and sisters:** Literally *brothers.* Paul uses this generic term to refer to members of the same family, both male and female. • **be eternally upon all who love our Lord Jesus Christ:** Or *be upon all who love our Lord Jesus Christ eternally.*\n\n
