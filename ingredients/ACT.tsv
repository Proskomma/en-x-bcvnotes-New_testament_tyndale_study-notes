1:1	idm141313					 Here Luke summarizes his **first book**, the Gospel of Luke, which Luke had previously written to **Theophilus** (*Luke 1:3*). Theophilus is elsewhere called “most honorable” (*Luke 1:3*)—the title indicates that he was a person of very high social standing (cp. *Acts 23:26*; *24:2*; *26:25*). He was probably a benefactor or patron who assisted Luke with the expenses of publication or distribution of his work (see *study note on Luke 1:3*).\n\n
1:3	idm141327					 **he proved to them in many ways that he was actually alive:** The Gospels describe the evidence for Christ’s resurrection: Jesus’ tomb was empty (*Luke 24:3-4*), his grave clothes were undisturbed (*John 20:3-9*), and many people saw him (see *Matt 28*; *Mark 16:1-8*; *Luke 24:1-53*; *John 20:11–21:23*; *1 Cor 15:3-8*). Jesus **appeared to the apostles** in part to overcome their doubt (*Matt 28:17*; *Luke 24:17-24*, *38*, *41*; *John 20:27*; see *Mark 16:14*) • The **Kingdom of God** was the central theme of Jesus’ teaching (see *Acts 1:6-8*; *Matt 4:17*; *Mark 1:14-15*; *Luke 4:43*).\n\n
1:4	idm141353					 **until the Father sends you the gift he promised:** See *2:1-13*; cp. *John 14:15-17*.\n\n
1:5	idm141362					 **baptized:** See “*Baptism*” Theme Note.\n\n
1:6	idm141370					 Jesus’ ascent into heaven (see also *Luke 24:50-53*) took place on the Mount of Olives (*Acts 1:12*; *Luke 24:50*). It was Jesus’ last physical appearance—he was taken into heaven, where he will remain “until the time for the final restoration of all things” (*Acts 3:21*).\n\n
1:8	idm141380					 This key verse outlines the geographical extension of the Good News from its Jewish starting point in **Jerusalem** and **Judea** (*1:6–8:1*), out to **Samaria** (*8:4-25*), Antioch in Syria (*11:19-30*), and eventually throughout the Mediterranean world to Rome (*13:1–28:31*). Christ later gave a similar call to be his **witnesses** . . . **to the ends of the earth** to Saul of Tarsus (*9:15*), who had persecuted the Jewish Christians and then became the primary instrument for taking the Good News to the Gentiles. • The **Holy Spirit** was the source of **power** for all this evangelistic and missionary effort.\n\n
1:10	idm141398					 Christ’s **rising into heaven** indicates his elevation to a place of ultimate authority (see *Eph 1:19-23*; *Phil 2:9-11*).\n\n
1:11	idm141407					 Jesus promised to **return from heaven in the same way** (see *Matt 24:30*; *Mark 13:26*; *John 14:3*). Jesus has gone to heaven to prepare the place for his followers (*John 12:26*; *14:1-4*; *2 Cor 5:4*; *Phil 3:21*; *Heb 6:20*).\n\n
1:12	idm141422					 The witnesses of the ascension **returned to Jerusalem** with joy, worship, exhilaration, and praise to God (*Luke 24:52*), and with their doubts assuaged (see *study note on Acts 1:3*).\n\n
1:13	idm141431					 While the apostles waited for the promised gift of the Holy Spirit (*1:4-5*), the whole company of 120 disciples in Jerusalem engaged in earnest prayer (*1:13-14*) and then appointed an apostle to replace Judas Iscariot (*1:15-26*).\n\n
1:13	idm141440					 All eleven of the remaining apostles **were present** (cp. *Matt 10:2-4*; *Mark 3:16-19*; *Luke 6:13-16*). Judas Iscariot is omitted from this list on account of his betrayal and death (*Acts 1:18-19*).\n\n
1:14	idm141451					 The first disciples were **united** in worship, fellowship, and **prayer** (see also *2:42*, *46-47*; *4:24-31*; *5:12*; *12:5*; *13:1-3*). The faithful women who had been witnesses of Jesus’ crucifixion and resurrection were present (*Luke 23:49*, *54-56*; *24:1-10*, *22*). • **The brothers of Jesus** had not believed in him during his ministry (*John 7:3-5*; cp. *Matt 12:46-49*), but became his disciples after his resurrection.\n\n
1:16	idm141472					 **the Scriptures had to be fulfilled:** See *1:20*.\n\n
1:18	idm141480					 Matthew’s account (*Matt 27:3-10*) is somewhat different; the two can be harmonized by considering the priests’ purchase of the **“Field of Blood”** as acting in Judas’s name. In addition, Judas may have committed suicide by hanging, but he subsequently fell **headfirst** and his **body split open***,* perhaps when the rope broke.\n\n
1:20	idm141491					 **‘Let someone else take his position’:** It was imperative that a **replacement** be found **for Judas** so that his position as the twelfth apostle would not remain empty. The new people of God, like Israel, were to have twelve designated and appointed leaders (see *Matt 19:28*; *Luke 22:29-30*).\n\n
1:21	idm141502					 To qualify for nomination as an apostle, a man had to have been **with** the other apostles **the entire time** of Jesus’ public ministry, **from the time he was baptized by John until** his ascension.\n\n
1:23	idm141511					 With prayer (*1:14*, *24*) and humble dependence on God to reveal his will, the apostles **cast lots***,* using an established method of finding God’s will (see *Lev 16:8*; *Num 27:21*; *Deut 33:8*; *Josh 14:2*; *18:3-10*; *Prov 16:33*). **Matthias was selected** to replace Judas. After Pentecost, the Holy Spirit guided Jesus’ followers through dreams, visions, and prophecies instead of through lots (cp. *Acts 2:17-18*; *13:2*; *16:7-10*). • **you know every heart:** See also *1 Sam 16:6-7*; *1 Kgs 8:39*; *1 Chr 28:9*; *2 Chr 6:30*; *Pss 7:9*; *44:21*; *Jer 11:20*; *John 2:24-25*; *Rev 2:23*.\n\n
2:1	idm141541					 Jews observed three great annual pilgrimage festivals, when many would go to the Temple in Jerusalem—Unleavened Bread (which includes Passover), **Pentecost** (Harvest), and Shelters (see *Lev 23:1-44*). On Pentecost, when the Jewish people were gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the harvest of God’s blessings, and when the disciples were united and expectant as they gathered for prayer, the **Holy Spirit** came and **filled** the gathered believers.\n\n
2:4	idm141551					 **everyone present was filled with the Holy Spirit:** This event marks the coming of the Holy Spirit to fill Jesus’ disciples, as he had promised, so that they could be powerful witnesses (*1:4-5*, *8*). The Spirit’s wisdom, energy, and power were the driving force behind the church’s work and witness (e.g., *2:14-41*, *43*; *4:31*; *9:17*, *20*; *13:9-12*; see also *Eph 5:18*). • **began speaking in other languages:** The Holy Spirit gave extraordinary communication that made it possible for people from other countries to hear in their own languages about what God had done (*Acts 2:6-11*). This passage is one of several references to speaking in “other languages” or “tongues” (see also *10:44-48*; *19:6*; *1 Cor 14:2-28*, *39*). Here, this supernatural gift reveals the energizing presence of God’s Spirit and inaugurates the proclamation of the Good News to people of every nation.\n\n
2:5	idm141573					 Because Pentecost was a pilgrimage festival (see *study note on 2:1-4*), Jews **from every nation** were present **in Jerusalem** at that time and were thus able to hear the Good News being proclaimed in **their own languages**. The Good News is for all people (*2:38-39*).\n\n
2:9	idm141584					 **Parthians** came from the region stretching from the Tigris River eastward to India. **Medes** (now called Kurds) were from Media, east of Mesopotamia and north of the Persian Gulf. **Elamites** were from Elam (now in Iran), north of the Persian Gulf and just east of the Tigris River. **Mesopotamia** lay between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. **Judea** was well known as the Jewish homeland. **Cappadocia, Pontus,** and **Asia** were Roman provinces in Asia Minor (now in Turkey; see *1 Pet 1:1*); Paul later taught and preached in some of these areas (see *Acts 16:6*; *19:10*, *26*). **Phrygia** and **Pamphylia** were districts of Asia Minor later visited by Paul (*13:13*; *18:23*). **Egypt** had a large Jewish population, particularly in the city of Alexandria (see *18:24*). North Africa was also represented by **Libya** and **Cyrene**. **Rome** was the imperial capital and the home of thousands of Jews. The **Cretans** came from the island of Crete, located south-southeast of Greece, and the **Arabs** from the area south and east of Jerusalem. • The inclusion of all of these nations suggests how the Good News was going to go out to the ends of the earth (*1:8*).\n\n
2:10	idm141613					 **converts to Judaism:** See *study note on 13:43*.\n\n
2:14	idm141621					 This is the first of about thirty speeches in Acts and one of the most important, standing as it does at the very inception of the church. It is a typical example of the preaching of the apostles, who proclaimed (1) that the Old Testament promises had been fulfilled in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, who is the promised Messiah; (2) that the apostles themselves were eyewitnesses of Jesus’ entire public ministry and were his chosen representatives; (3) that people are called to repent of their sins and have faith in God through Christ; and (4) that salvation and the presence of the Holy Spirit are promised to those who respond affirmatively to this message of Good News. This basic message is echoed in the sermons of chs *3*, *4*, *5*, *8*, *10*, *and 13*. The same themes characterized Paul’s preaching (see *1 Cor 15:3-9*). This message was repeatedly preached to both Jews and Gentiles throughout the Mediterranean world; all people are summoned to repent of their sins and turn to God through faith in Jesus Christ.\n\n
2:17	idm141634					 This passage quotes *Joel 2:28-32*. The prophet Joel predicted a wider exercise of the gifts of prophecy, including **visions** and **dreams** by both **young** and **old**, both **men and women** in **the last days** (*Joel 2:28-29*). In Acts, on the day of Pentecost, Peter declared that Joel’s prophecy was being fulfilled, signaling that “the last days” had arrived.\n\n
2:23	idm141648					 While cruel men had crucified Jesus, this action had not defeated God’s **prearranged plan** for salvation. In fact, God **raised him back to life***,* which David had foretold (*2:25-28*).\n\n
2:27	idm141658					 **among the dead:** See *study note on Matt 11:23*.\n\n
2:32	idm141666					 **God raised Jesus from the dead, and we are all witnesses of this:** The witness theme is often repeated in Acts (e.g., *3:15*; *4:33*; *5:32*; *10:39-43*). The capstone of this message is that God the Father, **as he had promised***,* was now pouring out his **Holy Spirit** on the church through the risen Jesus. All Israel was called upon to recognize that God had acted decisively to make the crucified Jesus **both Lord and Messiah!**\n\n
2:34	idm141681					 This passage quotes *Ps 110:1*, which Jesus fulfilled when he **ascended into heaven** (*Acts 1:9*).\n\n
2:37	idm141690					 **Brothers, what should we do?** Peter answered by strongly exhorting his listeners to **repent of your sins and turn to God, and be baptized**. See “*Baptism*” Theme Note.\n\n
2:42	idm141699					 Luke makes a clear connection between personal faith and membership in the Christian community. Life in this new community involved devotion to the apostolic **teaching** of God’s Word, fellowship, **sharing***,* joy, and praise, and it resulted in the Lord’s continuing to add to their number **those who were being saved**.\n\n
2:42	idm141709					 **fellowship:** Greek koinōnia*,* a close mutual relationship and participation in life together. • At this stage, **prayer** probably included participation in the formal prayers of the Temple (see *3:1*).\n\n
3:1	idm141720					 Jesus’ promise that his disciples would do even greater works than he had done (*John 14:12*; see *Mark 16:20*) was fulfilled in the signs, wonders, and mighty works of the apostles (*Acts 2:43*; *5:12*; *8:4-8*). Here, Peter clearly exercised the power to heal **in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene** (*3:6*, *16*). The cure was instant and undeniable (*3:8*), resulting in the man’s **praising God** (*3:8-9*; cp. *2:47*; *16:25*; *Luke 2:20*; *17:15-18*; *18:43*; *19:37*; *24:53*). This is the first of many demonstrations of divine power given to disciples in Acts (*Acts 4:24-31*; *5:12*; *6:8*; *8:6*; *9:33-42*; *28:8*).\n\n
3:6	idm141750					 **The name of Jesus** represents his identity and power to heal (see *Mark 9:38-39*).\n\n
3:10	idm141758					 The **Beautiful Gate** was probably the Nicanor Gate, built of Corinthian bronze and located on the east side of the Temple (see Josephus, *War* 5.5.3). It was adorned in a costly manner, with plates of silver and gold upon its panels richer and thicker than other gates. • **Solomon’s Colonnade** was a portico on the east side of the Temple (see Josephus, *War* 5.5.1-3; *Antiquities* 20.9.7).\n\n
3:12	idm141769					 The evangelistic speeches in the book of Acts focus on **Jesus***,* the crucified and risen Lord. They call people to repentance and faith in Jesus as the promised **Messiah** and the divinely appointed Judge (*2:38*; *3:19*; *11:18*; *17:30*; *26:20*). They also offer the same Good News for the people of Israel and the Gentile world—“there is peace with God through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all” (*10:36*).\n\n
3:15	idm141784					 It was unfathomable to the Jewish mind that **the author of life***,* God himself, could be **killed**. They did not recognize Jesus as Messiah (cp. *13:27*; *Luke 23:34*), and they did not realize that the Messiah would be divine (see *John 1:1-18*; cp. *Dan 7:13-14*).\n\n
3:17	idm141797					 **Friends:** Literally *Brothers,* which was a common way to address one another (*13:15*, *26*, *38*; *Gen 27:29*; *Lev 10:6*; *25:46*; *Num 20:3*; *Deut 1:28*; *24:7*; *Josh 22:3-4*; *2 Sam 2:26*; *Ezek 11:15*). • **in ignorance:** Cp. *Acts 17:30*; *1 Tim 1:12-14*. The Christian message challenges this ignorance and calls all people to respond in faith and repentance (*Acts 2:38*).\n\n
3:19	idm141821					 The message of Good News offers **refreshment** (see *Matt 11:28-29*). The second coming of Christ will be one of those **times of refreshment** from God, when he will **again send** . . . **Jesus** to his people.\n\n
3:19	idm141832					 The Good News of forgiveness is more fully explained elsewhere (see *5:30-32*; *10:36-43*; *13:26-38*; *Luke 24:25-27*, *45-47*).\n\n
3:22	idm141843					 Jesus fulfills the ancient promise of **a Prophet** like **Moses** (see *Deut 18:15*, *18*; cp. *John 6:14*; *7:40*).\n\n
3:23	idm141855					 Refusing to heed Jesus, God’s final **Prophet***,* would have disastrous consequences (*John 3:16*, *17*, *36*).\n\n
3:25	idm141866					 **all the families on earth will be blessed:** God’s blessings on the covenant people were not intended to be selfishly hoarded, but were to be shared with the world.\n\n
4:1	idm141873					 Persecution was a common experience of God’s people throughout the Bible. God’s servants often faced hostility and opposition (*Deut 30:7*; *1 Kgs 18:13*; *Neh 4:1-3*; *Jer 37–38*; *Matt 23:34-37*; *Luke 11:49-51*; *1 Thes 2:14-15*). Jesus himself was persecuted (*Luke 4:29*; *John 5:16*), and he told his disciples to expect the same kind of treatment (*Matt 10:23*; *24:9*; *Mark 13:9*; *Luke 21:12*; *John 16:2*), but he promised that the Holy Spirit would provide strength (*Acts 1:8*; *Luke 12:11-12*; *21:15*). Acts records frequent times of persecution (*Acts 4:3*; *5:17-41*; *7:54–8:3*; *9:1-2*; *11:19*; *12:2*; *13:50*; *14:19*; *16:19-24*), but Acts also reiterates that the Holy Spirit empowers disciples to bear witness in such circumstances (*2:44*; *4:8-13*; *6:10*; *7:55*). The boldness of Peter and John before the hostile high council exemplifies facing persecution with courage and power (*4:20*).\n\n
4:1	idm141910					 **Sadducees:** See “*The Sadducees*” Profile.\n\n
4:4	idm141918					 **the number of men who believed now totaled about 5,000:** See *study note on Matt 14:21*.\n\n
4:13	idm141926					 **ordinary men with no special training in the Scriptures:** That is, they were not scholars or ordained teachers—they were working men without higher education. The educated members of the Jewish high council were treated as authorities on the Scriptures and matters of religion, so it **amazed** them to see uneducated men speaking with such **boldness** about such matters.\n\n
4:16	idm141935					 They recognized the miracle but still stubbornly tried to prevent the message. Jesus had encountered similar resistance (*Matt 19:8*; *Mark 10:5*; see also *Deut 10:16*; *30:6*; *Jer 4:4*).\n\n
4:19	idm141946					 The apostles stated a principle that can guide God’s people in dealing with hostile authorities (see also *5:40*; cp. *1 Sam 15:22*; *Jer 7:23*; *Luke 20:20-26*; *Rom 13:1-7*). Jesus had predicted that his disciples would encounter hostility and persecution (*Luke 21:12-19*).\n\n
4:23	idm141958					 The believers **heard the report** that their leaders had been threatened and commanded never again to speak about Jesus (*4:18*). The Christian movement was clearly under attack from the religious authorities, so they united in **prayer**. They turned to **God,** placing their troubles before him and asking him to make them bold in speaking the message and to divinely confirm its truth with **signs and wonders**. God dramatically answered their request.\n\n
4:25	idm141969					 This passage quotes *Ps 2:1-2*, which describes the response of the Gentile nations to the Lord’s anointed king. In a similar manner, the Jews and Gentiles in Jerusalem had gathered together against Jesus and now against his followers.\n\n
4:26	idm141976					 The Hebrew term **Messiah** (“anointed one”) originally referred to Israel’s anointed king; it came to refer to the Messiah, the coming King of Israel who would establish God’s Kingdom forever (*2 Sam 7:14-16*; *Ps 89:36-37*; *Isa 9:6-7*; *11:1-9*; *61:1*; *Jer 23:5-6*; *33:14-16*; *Luke 1:32-33*).\n\n
4:28	idm141991					 God’s hand had been directing events all along in order to achieve his purpose. A similar awareness of God’s hand guiding the affairs of his people is found in the Old Testament (cp. *Ezra 7:6*, *9*, *28*; *8:18*, *31*; *Neh 2:8*, *18*; *Eccl 9:1*; *Ezek 8:1*; *Rom 8:28*; *1 Pet 5:6*).\n\n
4:32	idm142008					 The sharing of early believers was remarkable (see also *2:44-45*; cp. *6:1*). Being **united in heart and mind***,* they willingly offered anything they possessed to meet the needs of other believers. This sharing was voluntary and without coercion, and it related to pressing needs in the community and was prompted by Christian love and concern for one another.\n\n
4:36	idm142018					 **Barnabas** is held up as an example of generous, unselfish giving in response to the genuine needs in the Christian community.\n\n
5:1	idm142025					 Luke is fond of balancing a positive example with a negative example. He has just recorded the remarkable story of Barnabas (*4:36-37*). Now Luke presents the opposite conduct of **Ananias** and **Sapphira***,* who were tempted by the desire to be held in high regard. Ananias had not been forced to sell his property or to give the proceeds away. The couple’s sin was in their pretense and deception.\n\n
5:3	idm142035					 In **lying** about their **property** sale, Ananias was not just lying to others but **to the Holy Spirit**—that is, **to God**. His actions compromised the transparent sincerity, unity, and integrity of the church at its very foundation, and thus he fell under the direct judgment of God (cp. *Lev 10:1-5*; *Josh 7:16-26*).\n\n
5:11	idm142047					 **Great fear gripped the entire church and everyone else who heard what had happened:** The sudden judgment on Ananias and then on Sapphira had a sobering effect on both the Christian community and those who heard about this incident (cp. *Heb 10:31*). Believers were forcefully reminded that they needed to be pure, and for non-Christians the believers’ integrity was reestablished, so that once again “all the people had high regard for them” (*Acts 5:13*). Yet it also made outsiders wary of joining a movement with such high standards (*5:13*). This divine “pruning” (see *John 15:1-11*) helped new growth to follow (*Acts 5:14*; cp. *6:5-7*; *11:24*; *21:20*).\n\n
5:12	idm142062					 As in Jesus’ ministry, the apostles’ preaching was accompanied by **many miraculous signs and wonders***,* including convincing works of healing and exorcism (see also *6:8*; cp. *Matt 4:24*; *9:35*; *Mark 1:32-34*; *Luke 4:40-41*).\n\n
5:13	idm142075					 **no one else dared to join them:** Perhaps the high standards of belief or what had happened to Ananias and Sapphira (*5:11*) were daunting to the crowds. • **though all the people had high regard for them:** Christians were markedly different from the unbelievers around them.\n\n
5:17	idm142084					 The success of the apostles’ ministry again aroused strong opposition (cp. *4:1-3*). The wealthy and powerful **Sadducees** controlled the Temple establishment and had a Temple police force at their disposal. They opposed belief in the resurrection and were determined not to allow the apostles to proclaim their message about the resurrection of Jesus unchallenged. They also sensed that their hold on the Jewish people was loosening, so, **filled with jealousy***,* they attacked the apostles.\n\n
5:19	idm142094					 The irony here is that the Sadducees denied the existence of angels (*23:8*). Angels frequently intervened in Acts (see also *10:3*, *7*, *22*; *11:13*; *12:6-11*, *23*; *27:23-24*). Luke presents God as guiding his people in their ministry, using angels to accomplish his purpose.\n\n
5:29	idm142108					 See *study note on 4:19-20*.\n\n
5:30	idm142115					 **We are witnesses of these things:** The apostles, as witnesses, were required to testify to what they had seen and heard (see *Lev 5:1*; cp. *Acts 1:8*; *Matt 28:18-20*; *Luke 24:44-49*; *John 20:21*).\n\n
5:33	idm142127					 God once again thwarted the Jewish leaders’ plans to stop the apostles—this time through the counsel of **Gamaliel**.\n\n
5:34	idm142134					 **Gamaliel** was an eminent **Pharisee***,* a leader in the Jewish high council, and a famous teacher of the law. He was Paul’s teacher during his rabbinical education (see *22:3*).\n\n
5:36	idm142144					 This **Theudas** is otherwise unknown, although Josephus mentions a different man by that name who raised a revolt some years later (see Josephus, *Antiquities* 20.5.1). Theudas was a common Jewish name. • **Judas of Galilee** appears in Josephus as a rebel who opposed giving tribute to Caesar about AD 6 or 7, following the census of Quirinius (see Josephus, *Antiquities* 20.5.2; cp. *Luke 2:2*). His resistance, too, was crushed.\n\n
6:1	idm142156					 **The Greek-speaking believers** were Jewish Christians who had lived elsewhere in the Greco-Roman world and probably observed some Greek customs. **The Hebrew-speaking believers** were more traditional Jews, native to Palestine, who spoke Hebrew or Aramaic and refrained from Greek customs. • **their widows were being discriminated against:** This injustice threatened the growth and development of the church with **rumblings of discontent** and had to be addressed.\n\n
6:2	idm142166					 Wisely, the apostles **called a meeting of all the believers** to address the dispute. They recognized the seriousness of the problem, as well as their own priority of **teaching the word of God**. The solution was to select wise and Spirit-filled men to oversee the food distribution. The community accepted the apostles’ solution and chose good leaders from the ranks of the Greek-speaking believers (all of their names are Greek). These **seven** devoted themselves to this special ministry, allowing the **apostles** to **spend** their time **in prayer and teaching the word**. • **These seven** men are sometimes called the first deacons because of the similarity of their role to the office of deacon (see *1 Tim 3:8-13*). Although the Greek term translated “deacon” (Greek diakonos, “servant”) is not used here, a related Greek word is translated **running a food program** (*6:2*; Greek diakonein*,* “to serve”).\n\n
6:7	idm142185					 The result of the apostles’ wise handling of the issue was growth and increase in **the number of believers***,* including **many of the Jewish priests**. • This is the first of three places in Acts where Luke notes that **God’s message continued to spread** (see also *12:24*; *19:20*). When real difficulties arose, God’s message could overcome the challenges posed by internal strife, idolatry, and paganism, and the result was growth in the community. Acts is the story of the unhindered message of Good News (see *28:31*).\n\n
6:8	idm142198					 The Jewish leaders did to **Stephen** as they had done to Jesus (cp. *Matt 26:3-4*, *59-66*): They got someone **to lie** about him, accused him of blasphemy, incited a riot, arrested him, and posted false charges against him.\n\n
6:15	idm142208					 **His face became as bright as an angel’s***,* just as Moses’ face had (*6:14*; see *Exod 34:32-35*). Stephen, like Moses, was bringing God’s instruction to Israel (see also *2 Cor 3:7-18*).\n\n
7:1	idm142219					 Stephen responded to the accusations by testifying about his Lord (cp. *Luke 21:12-17*). Instead of defending himself against their prosecution, he became a witness in God’s prosecution of them, exposing their stubbornness and unfaithfulness to God. Stephen’s recital of Israel’s past reminded them of their repeated rejections of those whom God had sent. • Stephen’s review of Israel’s history has three principal parts, dealing with the work of the patriarchs (*Acts 7:2-16*), the ministry of Moses (*7:17-43*), and the role of the Tabernacle and the Temple (*7:44-50*). Stephen followed up his historical survey with a clear attack on the hard-heartedness of his own people. With a prophetic challenge, he urged them to stop rebelling against the **Holy Spirit** and turn to God with repentance and faith.\n\n
7:8	idm142230					 **the covenant of circumcision:** See *Gen 17:9-14*; see also “*Circumcision in the New Testament*” Theme Note.\n\n
7:14	idm142239					 Compare this figure with the *seventy* mentioned in the Hebrew text of *Gen 46:27*. The number **seventy-five** is probably taken from the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament) for *Gen 46:27*. The Septuagint includes three descendants of Ephraim and two of Manasseh at *Gen 46:20*, making for a total of five more persons, whereas the Hebrew text does not include descendants for Joseph’s sons. The New Testament authors often quote from the Septuagint, which sometimes differs from the Hebrew Masoretic Text.\n\n
7:16	idm142250					 **a certain price:** Four hundred pieces of silver, according to *Gen 23:16*.\n\n
7:37	idm142258					 This verse quotes *Deut 18:15*. **Moses** had prophesied that the Messiah would come, and it had happened as Moses said.\n\n
7:39	idm142266					 Just as the ancient Jews had **rejected** what **Moses** was saying, now Stephen was speaking to descendants who were still rejecting God’s deliverers—in this case, Jesus, the ultimate deliverer.\n\n
7:42	idm142274					 This passage quotes *Amos 5:25-27* (Greek version) to illustrate how the people of Israel rebelled against Moses (*Acts 7:39-41*). **Molech** was a Canaanite god to whom human sacrifices were offered (*Lev 18:21*; *20:2-5*; *1 Kgs 11:7*; *2 Kgs 23:10*; *Jer 32:35*). **Rephan***,* a star god identified with the planet Saturn, was worshiped by the Israelites during their wilderness wanderings.\n\n
7:48	idm142290					 One of the charges was that Stephen was speaking against the Temple (cp. *6:14*). The leading priests and scribes controlled the Temple commerce and had a vital business interest in maintaining their enterprises unhindered (see *Luke 19:45-48*). That is why these leaders were so worried about the Temple despite the fact that God himself had said that **the Most High doesn’t live in temples made by human hands**.\n\n
7:51	idm142299					 Stephen raised the same charge that God had raised against his people in the wilderness: that they were **heathen at heart and deaf to the truth***,* because they were rejecting the gospel and obstinately resisting **the Holy Spirit** (see *Exod 32:9*; *33:3*; *34:9*; *Deut 9:6*, *13*; *31:27*; see also *Ps 78:8*; *Zech 7:11-12*).\n\n
7:55	idm142316					 **Jesus standing . . . at God’s right hand:** Usually Jesus is described as *seated* in heaven at God’s right hand (*2:33-34*; *5:31*; *Luke 20:42*; *22:69*; *Rom 8:34*; *Eph 1:20*; *Col 3:1*; *Heb 1:3*, *13*; *10:12*). One possible explanation is that Jesus was welcoming Stephen, the first martyr, to heaven with **honor**. Stephen had confessed his Lord faithfully on earth, and now his Lord honored his promise to confess his faithful servant in heaven, standing as a witness to defend him (*Matt 10:32*; *Luke 12:8*). • **the Son of Man standing:** Cp. *Dan 7:13-14*. The Jewish leaders understood that Stephen was speaking of Jesus as the divine Son of Man (*Acts 7:57*), a title that speaks of Jesus’ power and authority (cp. *Rev 1:12-15*).\n\n
7:57	idm142341					 **they put their hands over their ears:** They believed that the comparison of Jesus to the divine Son of Man (*7:56*) was horrible blasphemy.\n\n
7:58	idm142349					 **Saul** was the Hebrew form, Paul the Greek form of his name (see *13:9*).\n\n
7:59	idm142357					 Stephen’s prayer, **Lord, don’t charge them with this sin***,* is strikingly similar to Jesus’ prayer at his crucifixion (*Luke 23:34*). Jesus clearly taught his followers the importance of both forgiveness (*Matt 6:14-15*; *Mark 11:25*; see *Luke 11:4*; *17:3-4*) and prayer (*Luke 11:5-10*; *18:1-8*; see also *Acts 1:12-15*; *4:23-31*; *12:5*; *Jas 5:16-18*). The Lord answered Stephen’s prayer affirmatively in the case of Saul (*Acts 9:1-43*).\n\n
8:1	idm142377					 **Saul:** Cp. *9:1-2*; *22:4*; *26:9-11*; *Gal 1:13-14*. The result of this **great wave of persecution** was that **all the believers** . . . **were scattered**. Rather than having their enthusiasm dampened, however, they simply spread the **Good News about Jesus wherever they went**.\n\n
8:7	idm142392					 **cast out . . . healed:** Miracles often accompany evangelism in Acts (see *study note on 3:1-11*).\n\n
8:9	idm142400					 **Simon** the **sorcerer** was a showman, dazzling the people of Samaria and making self-exalting claims. Simon’s attempt to obtain spiritual power through payment gave the name *simony* to the later corrupt practice of buying and selling ordination to church leadership (cp. *1 Tim 6:9-10*). Peter strongly rebuked Simon’s **wickedness**.\n\n
8:14	idm142411					 When **the apostles** sent two of their own to **Samaria***,* it was an amazing step in overcoming prejudice (cp. *Matt 10:5*; *Luke 9:52-54*; *John 4:9*; *8:48*). Then, it was even more amazing that **Peter and John** prayed that the new Samaritan believers would **receive the Holy Spirit**. This event parallels the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem (*Acts 2:1-47*) and marks the spread of the Holy Spirit’s power from Judea to Samaria (*1:8*).\n\n
8:24	idm142428					 **Simon** recognized the need for Peter to intercede in prayer for him, but it is not clear that he repented and turned from his wickedness. His main concern was apparently to avoid the **terrible** consequences that Peter predicted when his wicked motives were exposed.\n\n
8:26	idm142436					 **Philip** obeyed the Holy Spirit’s leading and then seized the opportunity to share the message of **Good News** with a **eunuch** on the **desert road . . . from Jerusalem to Gaza**. This incident shows Philip’s remarkable effectiveness as a Christian apologist and evangelist in his outreach for Christ and in his commitment to bringing the Good News to all people regardless of social class or ethnicity.\n\n
8:27	idm142446					 In the ancient world, a **eunuch** was an official, typically castrated, who served in a royal court (see *2 Kgs 9:30-32*; *Esth 1:10*; *2:3*, *14-15*, *21*; *4:4-5*). Eunuchs were often scorned by Jews because they could not perpetuate the covenant family, and the law of Moses excluded men who had damaged genitals from the assembly of Israel (*Deut 23:1*; cp. *Lev 21:17-23*), but Isaiah spoke of God’s acceptance of Gentiles and eunuchs (*Isa 56:3-8*; see also *Matt 19:12*). In the new covenant, all who have genuine faith have a place among the people of God. • The eunuch had traveled from Africa **to Jerusalem to worship** in the Temple, probably for one of the great Jewish festivals.\n\n
8:29	idm142464					 **The Holy Spirit** guides the servants of God in where, when, and what to preach, teach, or do (*9:15*; *10:19-20*; *11:12*; *16:6*; *1 Cor 2:13*; *1 Pet 1:12*).\n\n
8:32	idm142477					 **The passage of Scripture** was *Isa 53:7-8*, one of the Servant Songs of Isaiah, a passage that speaks of the suffering servant of the Lord.\n\n
8:39	idm142485					 After **the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away***,* Philip continued northward from **Azotus** (=Ashdod, *1 Sam 5:1-7*; *Neh 13:23-24*; *Isa 20:1*) up the coast, preaching **in every town along the way until he came to Caesarea***,* where he settled (*Acts 21:8*). • **Caesarea** Maritima, a major seaport on the Mediterranean, was the seat of Roman government in Judea. It was built by Herod the Great about 22–9 BC and was named to honor Caesar Augustus.\n\n
9:1	idm142502					 The conversion of **Saul** of Tarsus on the **Damascus** road is of central importance to the narrative of Acts—Luke recounts the story three times (also *22:1-21*; *26:1-29*). Paul (Saul) also alludes to this experience several times in his letters (*1 Cor 15:8-10*; *Gal 1:11-17*; *Phil 3:4-11*; see *1 Tim 1:12-17*). Saul’s conversion was his prophetic call and commission as an apostle (*Acts 9:15*; *22:15*, *21*; *26:15-18*). No one is beyond the power of God to reach, redeem, and use for holy purposes—nothing is impossible with God (*Luke 1:37*). Paul was prepared through his training, upbringing, and experience to play a unique role in taking the gospel into the broader world as the “apostle to the Gentiles” (*Rom 11:13*; see *1 Cor 15:9*; *2 Cor 12:11-12*; *Gal 1:1*; *Eph 3:8*).\n\n
9:2	idm142526					 The **synagogues** (Greek sunagōgē, “gathering place”) were local Jewish meeting places. After the Exile, Jews began to meet in local synagogues as places of instruction and centers of worship. Synagogue services consisted of the reading of the Law and the Prophets, exposition of the Scriptures, prayer, praise, and thanksgiving (see *13:15*; *15:21*; *Neh 9:5*; *Matt 6:5*; *Luke 4:16-21*). Jesus attended, taught, preached, and performed miracles in synagogues (*Matt 12:9-10*; *Mark 1:21*, *39*; *Luke 4:16*; *13:10-13*; *John 6:59*; *18:20*), as did the apostles (see *Acts 9:20*; *13:5*, *14*; *14:1*; *17:1*, *10*, *17*; *18:4*, *19*, *26*). • **Damascus***,* the capital of Syria, was an important center with a long and distinguished past and the nearest major city outside of Palestine. It took from four to six days to reach Damascus from Jerusalem, a fact that highlights Saul’s earnestness (*9:1-5*; see *22:4-8*; *26:9-15*). • The expression **the Way** is used in Acts for Christianity (see *19:9*, *23*; *24:14*, *22*)—it is “the way of God” (*18:26*) that tells people “how to be saved” (*16:17*, literally *the way of salvation*). See also *John 14:6*; *2 Pet 2:2*.\n\n
9:10	idm142571					 **Ananias:** See also *22:12*. The name Ananias was quite common (note the husband of Sapphira, *5:1*, and the Jewish high priest [AD 47–59], *23:2*). • **a vision:** See “*Visions*” Theme Note.\n\n
9:15	idm142584					 **Saul is my chosen instrument to take my message to the Gentiles:** In God’s plan for spreading the Good News, the Gentiles were the next step (see *1:8*; cp. chs *10–11*). Saul of Tarsus (Paul) was God’s choice to spearhead this expansive missionary effort to bring the Christian **message to the Gentiles and to kings, as well as to the people of Israel**. The rest of Acts illustrates Saul’s (Paul’s) faithfulness in carrying out this divine commission (e.g., *26:19-23*).\n\n
9:16	idm142595					 As Jesus predicted, Paul suffered greatly for his faith (see *2 Cor 11:23-27*; see *Acts 13:45*; *14:19*; *16:22-27*; *21:30-31*; *26:21*; *2 Tim 1:11-12*).\n\n
9:17	idm142608					 Ananias’s God-given role was to welcome Saul into the Christian family, beginning with laying hands on Saul to heal him and fill him **with the Holy Spirit**.\n\n
9:20	idm142615					 **immediately he began preaching about Jesus:** The genuineness of Saul’s encounter with the risen Christ is attested by the enthusiasm and boldness of his preaching. Saul’s outspoken declaration provoked astonishment, for he was the very man who had created **such devastation among Jesus’ followers in Jerusalem**.\n\n
9:22	idm142623					 Despite the bewilderment of his hearers, Saul so compellingly presented the evidence for the claims of **Jesus** as **Messiah** that the non-believing **Jews in Damascus** found themselves unable to **refute** it. Apparently this went on for some time (see *Gal 1:18*), so some of the non-believing Jews launched a plot on his life, but he was spared when some believers let him down out of the city in **a large basket**. Paul recounts this incident in *2 Cor 11:32-33*.\n\n
9:26	idm142636					 **When Saul arrived in Jerusalem***,* the Christian community understandably did not immediately trust him, given his recent history of violently persecuting Christians (*8:3*; *9:1*, *13*; *22:3*, *4*; *26:9-11*). Fortunately, **Barnabas**, the “Son of Encouragement” (*4:36*), introduced the changed man to **the apostles** and explained his encounter with the Lord at **Damascus***,* his sense of calling, and his subsequent boldness in preaching **in the name of Jesus in Damascus**. Barnabas was able to convince the apostles that Saul’s conversion was genuine, so Saul remained with the apostles in Jerusalem, where he **preached boldly** for his Lord. Paul recalls this visit in *Gal 1:18-19*.\n\n
9:29	idm142658					 Again Saul **debated with some Greek-speaking Jews***,* and again an assassination was planned (cp. *9:22-24*).\n\n
9:30	idm142667					 After the **believers heard about** the plot, Saul was once again sent away (cp. *9:25*), this time **to Tarsus, his hometown***,* the capital of Cilicia (see *21:39*; *22:3*; *23:34*; cp. *Gal 1:21*).\n\n
9:31	idm142681					 This verse is one of several in Acts that detail the numerical and spiritual growth of the church (see also *2:41*; *4:4*; *5:14*; *6:1*, *7*; *12:24*; *21:20*). • The first Christians were discovering the truth of the principle, “**the fear of the Lord** is the foundation of true knowledge” (*Prov 1:7*; *9:10*; cp. *Job 28:28*; *Ps 111:10*; *Eccl 12:13*; see *Luke 7:16*), and they were growing in their faith (cp. *Acts 2:43*; *19:17*).\n\n
9:32	idm142703					 These verses describe Peter’s itinerant ministry in Judea, particularly along the seacoast. Exercising spiritual powers given to him by God, Peter performed wonderful works, including the healing of **Aeneas** and the raising of **Dorcas**. Jesus had promised such signs and wonders to the disciples (*John 14:12*). • Typical of Luke’s writing, the healing of a man is matched by the healing of a woman (see *Luke 13:10-17*; *14:1-6*). The people in the area were deeply moved by these miracles, and many were drawn into the faith (*Acts 9:35*, *42*).\n\n
9:43	idm142716					 **living with Simon, a tanner of hides:** Tanning was an unclean business in Jewish eyes, which might suggest that Peter was not scrupulous in observing Jewish traditions (cp. *Gal 2:11-14*).\n\n
10:1	idm142724					 **a Roman army officer:** Literally *a centurion*, the highest-ranking non-commissioned officer in the Roman army, in command of a *century,* a subdivision of roughly 100 men. Luke often describes centurions in favorable terms (*10:22*; *21:32*; *22:25-26*; *23:17*, *23*; *27:6*, *11*, *43*; *28:16*; *Luke 7:1-10*; *23:47*). It was important for Luke to show that Christianity was not hostile to Roman officials or institutions and could, like Judaism, be permitted in the Roman Empire (see *Acts Book Introduction*, “Purposes of Acts: Politics”). • **a captain of the Italian Regiment:** A regiment included six centuries; a Roman legion was usually divided into ten regiments. The New Testament mentions the Italian Regiment and the Imperial Regiment (*Acts 27:1*).\n\n
10:2	idm142747					 **a devout, God-fearing man:** Gentiles who are described as *God-fearing* were attracted to the high ethical standards of Judaism but were not prepared to accept the rite of circumcision or the full implications of the Jewish law by becoming full converts to Judaism (cp. *13:43*). Christianity was an attractive option to Gentiles who worshiped God (*18:7*; see *13:48*; *16:30*; *17:4*, *12*, *17*). These people would be wide open to the message of the gospel that announced that “there is peace with God through Jesus Christ” (*10:36*).\n\n
10:3	idm142763					 In Acts, visions are usually related to prayer (*9:3-6*, *10-16*; *10:2-6*, *9-12*; *11:5-9*; *12:9-17*; *18:9-10*; *22:17-21*; *23:11*). These visions are not chance coincidences, but expressions of God’s saving work, providing divine direction and encouragement.\n\n
10:9	idm142778					 **Peter** received the same vision **three times** to confirm its truthfulness (see *Gen 41:32*; *2 Cor 13:1*).\n\n
10:14	idm142788					 See *Lev 11* for a description of animals that **Jewish laws have declared impure and unclean**.\n\n
10:17	idm142796					 **Peter was very perplexed:** The meaning of the vision would become clear through the events that followed (*10:17-48*; see *11:1-18*): Peter should not hesitate to enter or even eat in the home of a Gentile because God has accepted Gentiles and cleansed them.\n\n
10:25	idm142805					 **Cornelius . . . worshiped him:** This act must have been more than traditional obeisance to a high-ranking person. The Bible restricts worship to God alone (see *14:11-17*; *Exod 20:3*; *Deut 5:7*; *Matt 22:37-38*; *Mark 12:29-30*; *Luke 10:27*; *1 Cor 10:14*; *Col 3:5*; *1 Pet 4:3*; *1 Jn 5:21*; *Rev 4:10*; *9:20*; *22:8-9*). Peter was just a fellow **human being** whom Cornelius should not worship.\n\n
10:34	idm142826					 **God shows no favoritism:** See *Deut 10:17*; *2 Chr 19:7*; *Job 34:19*; *Luke 20:21*; *Rom 2:11*; *Gal 2:6*; *Col 3:25*; *1 Pet 1:17*. The application of this principle is the meaning of Peter’s vision (*10:9-16*). • **In every nation he accepts those who fear him and do what is right:** See *Rom 10:11-13*.\n\n
10:36	idm142844					 Peter repeatedly underscores the importance of the apostolic **witnesses** to **the message of Good News**. The apostles **ate and drank with** Jesus (see *Luke 24:41-43*) and were eyewitnesses of his resurrection, so they could attest that he had conquered death (see *Acts 3:15*; *4:33*; *13:30-31*). The original apostles were **chosen in advance to be his witnesses** (see *1:12-26*); gradually, others such as Paul and Barnabas carried on this powerful preaching and teaching in the name of Jesus Christ (*9:15*; *14:1-3*; *26:16*).\n\n
10:43	idm142862					 Based on what they had seen and heard (*10:39-42*), the apostles could proclaim that Jesus of Nazareth was indeed **the one all the prophets testified about**. The whole plan of the Scriptures is profoundly centered in Christ (see *Luke 24:25-27*, *44-47*; *John 5:39*). • The major point of their message was that **everyone who believes in him will have their sins forgiven through his name** (see *Luke 24:47*).\n\n
10:44	idm142875					 On the day of Pentecost, Peter told the assembly that if they would repent, turn to God, and be baptized in the name of Jesus for the forgiveness of sins, they would receive “the gift of the Holy Spirit” (*2:38*; cp. *19:1-7*). As Cornelius and his household listened to Peter’s message, **the Holy Spirit fell upon** them, too, and they were **baptized**. They received the Holy Spirit **just as** the Jews did, so clearly God had shown no partiality (*10:34-35*). This event parallels the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem (*2:1-47*) and marks the spread of the Holy Spirit’s power to Gentiles (*1:8*; *2:39*).\n\n
10:48	idm142890					 **Cornelius asked** Peter **to stay with them for several days***,* perhaps because of his need for instruction in the Christian way.\n\n
11:1	idm142899					 Jews traditionally kept themselves separate and did not eat or associate socially with Gentiles (*10:28*; *22:21-22*; see *John 4:9*, *27*; *18:28*; *Gal 2:12-14*). Therefore, when the Jewish believers in Jerusalem learned that **Gentiles had received the word of God***,* they **criticized** Peter’s unconventional actions and wanted an explanation, which Peter provided.\n\n
11:4	idm142914					 Peter reviewed the sequence of events, explaining that the whole development was the result of God’s initiative (*11:12*). Peter had eaten with Gentiles because God had made it clear that he should (*11:4-12*). Peter had then observed the Holy Spirit’s definite action of coming upon Gentiles, and he realized that they were being accepted and blessed by God just as Jewish believers had been (*11:15-17*; see *1:5*). Peter was submitting to God’s will in admitting Gentiles to the church.\n\n
11:18	idm142924					 Peter’s logical, straightforward explanation convinced those who had objected—they recognized God’s hand at work in the conversion of the Gentiles and their **receiving eternal life**. However, issues relating to the inclusion of Gentiles would soon provoke a major crisis (*15:1-35*; Paul’s letter to the Galatians).\n\n
11:19	idm142932					 **The persecution** that followed **Stephen’s death** forced believers into other areas (*8:1-3*), and they **traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch**. • **Antioch of Syria** was a thriving cosmopolitan city, the third-largest in the Roman Empire after Rome and Alexandria. Antioch was of central importance in the spread of the Christian message to the Gentile world.\n\n
11:20	idm142943					 This outreach effort on the part of Jewish **believers . . . from Cyprus and Cyrene** was the first systematic attempt to preach to Gentiles **about the Lord Jesus**.\n\n
11:21	idm142951					 Once again, as had happened in the household of Cornelius, Gentiles **turned to the Lord** in considerable numbers. The explosion of Christian faith into the Gentile world had to remain in harmony with the church at Jerusalem, so the Jerusalem church **sent Barnabas to Antioch** to oversee developments there. He could see that **God’s blessing** was on what was happening, so he endorsed it **with joy**.\n\n
11:25	idm142961					 **Barnabas** recognized the special gifts that **Saul** possessed for preaching and **teaching**. His assessment of Saul’s gifts was wise, and it resulted in a fruitful team ministry in Antioch.\n\n
11:26	idm142970					 **Christians** was possibly a term of derision. The Greek text uses this term in only two other New Testament passages (*26:28*; *1 Pet 4:16*).\n\n
11:27	idm142979					 **some prophets:** See “*The Gift of Prophecy*” Theme Note. • **Agabus:** See also *21:10-12*.\n\n
11:28	idm142989					 **Claudius,** nephew of Tiberius Caesar (*Luke 3:1*), was the Roman emperor in AD 41–54. His last wife was his niece Agrippina, whose son Nero he adopted.\n\n
11:29	idm142998					 The upshot of Agabus’s prophecy was that the believers in Antioch decided to make a contribution to the Jewish believers—**the brothers and sisters**—in Judea. The believers in Antioch gave as generously **as they could** and committed the responsibility for this financial aid to leaders they trusted, namely, to **Barnabas** and his fellow worker **Saul**. This unified love and support of Christians for one another was a tangible demonstration of the difference Christ had made in their lives. Paul describes this visit in his letter to the Galatians (*Gal 2:1-10*).\n\n
11:30	idm143009					 This is the first reference in Acts to **elders** as officers of the Christian church (see also *14:23*; *15:2-23*; *16:4*; *20:17-35*; *21:18*; cp. *1 Tim 3:1-7*; *Titus 1:5-9*).\n\n
12:1	idm143023					 Jesus had clearly predicted persecution and hardship for his followers (*Luke 11:49-51*). For the first time since Jesus’ death, Roman authorities took direct violent action against the church. **James***,* the brother of John, was one of the first called to be a disciple (*Mark 1:16-20*; *Luke 5:1-11*), and he was one of the first Christians to be martyred for his faith. • **King Herod Agrippa** attacked **the church** (cp. *Acts 12:20-23*), a move that he found to be politically helpful with **the Jewish people**. The letter of James, the brother of Jesus, was probably written after this persecution to the scattered Christians (see *8:1-4*; *James Book Introduction*, “Date of Writing”).\n\n
12:4	idm143040					 Herod had Peter guarded by **four squads** of soldiers, making it humanly impossible for the apostle to escape (cp. *12:6*). However, God was in charge, and nothing is too hard for him (cp. *4:27-31*; *Gen 18:14*; *Jer 32:17*, *27*; *Matt 19:26*; *Mark 10:27*; *Luke 1:37*; *18:27*).\n\n
12:5	idm143056					 **the church prayed very earnestly:** God answers the earnest prayers of his people (*12:6-17*; see *Luke 11:1-13*; *18:1-8*; cp. *Matt 7:7-11*; *John 15:7*; *Phil 4:6-7*; *Jas 5:16*; *1 Jn 3:22*).\n\n
12:6	idm143071					 God, through **an angel***,* led Peter out, reunited him with his praying friends, and sent him out to carry on the work of spreading the Good News. The message advanced despite determined opposition.\n\n
12:7	idm143079					 See “*Angels*” Theme Note.\n\n
12:12	idm143086					 **The home of Mary, the mother of John Mark***,* was evidently a gathering place for believers. John Mark later became a missionary colleague of Barnabas and Saul (*12:25*).\n\n
12:13	idm143095					 **Rhoda** was so surprised when Peter appeared that she left him standing at the closed **door**. Both she and the other believers were **amazed** by God’s answer to their prayers (*12:5*).\n\n
12:18	idm143105					 When Peter couldn’t be found after a careful **search***,* Herod **interrogated the guards** and put them to **death** (cp. *16:27*). However, Herod met his own painful end as a divine judgment on his conceit when he **accepted the people’s worship**. Josephus records the death of Herod Agrippa I in greater detail (Josephus, *Antiquities* 19.8.1-2).\n\n
12:24	idm143118					 Herod’s demise from a terrible illness (*12:23*) contrasts with the growth of the Christian church and the unhindered message of Good News (*28:31*).\n\n
13:1	idm143126					 The **prophets and teachers of the church at Antioch** spent significant time in worship and prayer, earnestly seeking the Lord’s will as they fasted and opened themselves to divine direction. As they prayed, **the Holy Spirit** spoke to them, and they set apart **Barnabas and Saul** in clear recognition of God’s call for them to carry out a **special work** in his name. The believers’ inward journey in prayer and listening to God is matched by their outward journey in service, evangelism, and mighty works of healing and salvation.\n\n
13:1	idm143136					 **prophets and teachers:** See “*The Gift of Prophecy*” Theme Note; see also *1 Cor 12:28-29*; *Eph 4:11*. • The name **Simeon** suggests a Jewish background (see *Gen 29:33*; *Luke 2:25*; *3:30*); he is also **called “the black man”**—he was probably of African descent. • **Lucius** is a Latin name; he came **from Cyrene***,* the capital of Libya in North Africa. He was probably one of the preachers from Cyrene who had brought the Christian message to Antioch (*Acts 11:20*). • **Manaen** had been brought up with **King Herod Antipas;** he was probably Luke’s source for insight into Antipas’s thoughts and actions (see *Luke 9:7-9*). • **Barnabas** and **Saul** are prominently featured in the subsequent narrative.\n\n
13:3	idm143160					 **the men laid their hands on them:** This solemn act was only done **after more fasting and prayer***;* the Pastoral Epistles warn against laying hands on a person to appoint that person as a Christian leader without due care and diligence (*1 Tim 5:22*). At this point, Barnabas and Saul were **sent** . . . **on their way** as missionaries of the church at Antioch.\n\n
13:4	idm143172					 Barnabas and Saul’s first missionary journey was undertaken with a strong consciousness of **the Holy Spirit** as their guide. • **Seleucia** was Antioch’s ancient **seaport***,* located about twelve miles (20 km) west of the city at the mouth of the Orontes River. • Their journey took them westward by sea to **the island of Cyprus***,* which was Barnabas’s homeland (*4:36*).\n\n
13:5	idm143185					 Landing in **the town of Salamis** on the eastern end of Cyprus, they **went to the Jewish synagogues** (see *study note on 9:2*), where the Jews could hear and respond to the Christian message. They would also meet converts to Judaism (see *study note on 13:43*) and spiritually hungry Gentiles who are sometimes described as “God-fearers” (see *study note on 10:2*).\n\n
13:6	idm143196					 At **Paphos** there was a power struggle with a **false prophet***,* with the result that the power of God was manifested and the Roman governor **became a believer**.\n\n
13:6	idm143206					 **Paphos** was located on the southwest coast of Cyprus. As the leading city of Cyprus, it was of strategic importance. • **a Jewish sorcerer . . . named Bar-Jesus:** Such eastern magicians often exercised a tremendous influence in the Greco-Roman world.\n\n
13:7	idm143214					 **The governor, Sergius Paulus, who was an intelligent man***,* was attracted to the teaching of Barnabas and Saul. But **Elymas** (the sorcerer’s Greco-Roman name) recognized a challenge to his power and strongly opposed the message of Barnabas and Saul.\n\n
13:9	idm143223					 Luke makes the significant transition from the name **Saul** (a Hebrew name) to **Paul** (a Greco-Roman name), perhaps indicating that Paul was now on a predominantly Gentile mission. For the rest of the book of Acts, he is called Paul except when he recounts his conversion (as in *22:7*, *13*; *26:14*).\n\n
13:10	idm143234					 Paul, who became the chief spokesman, rebuked the sorcerer’s fraudulent claims, exposed his deceit, and pronounced divine judgment (cp. *8:20-24*). The sorcerer was **instantly** struck **blind***,* a condition that lasted **for some time***,* giving a strong demonstration of the truthfulness and superiority of the apostolic message over the bogus claims of the sorcerer.\n\n
13:12	idm143246					 The **teaching about the Lord** included a miraculous demonstration of divine power (cp. *Mark 1:21-27*), for it was a teaching about the living God (see *Acts 14:15*).\n\n
13:13	idm143255					 They landed at the port of **Perga**. From here, major roads opened into the interior beyond the Taurus Mountains. • At this point, **John Mark left** the team for reasons that are not stated (see *study note on 15:36-41*). Possibly he was unhappy that the Good News was moving out into Gentile lands; possibly he was homesick or otherwise unable to continue a difficult journey. Whatever the reason, he **returned to** the more familiar and comfortable Jewish surroundings of **Jerusalem**.\n\n
13:14	idm143266					 **Paul and Barnabas traveled inland** into the high country and came to **Antioch of Pisidia** (in the Roman province of Galatia in Asia Minor, not to be confused with Antioch in Syria). As was their custom, the apostles began at **the synagogue** (see *study note on 9:2*; cp. *13:5*; *14:1*; *17:1*, *2*, *10*, *17*; *18:4*, *19*; *19:8*).\n\n
13:15	idm143285					 After the **usual** Scriptures for the day had been read, one from **the books of Moses** and the other from **the prophets** (see *Luke 4:16-28*), the officials of the synagogue invited the visitors to speak **any word of encouragement for the people**.\n\n
13:16	idm143296					 **Paul** accepted the invitation, motioned **to quiet** his audience (cp. *19:33*; *21:40*), and launched into a straightforward proclamation of **the Good News**. This is Paul’s first great speech in Acts, and it provides a model of his preaching to a Jewish audience (see *22:1-21*).\n\n
13:17	idm143308					 To establish common ground, Paul traced Jewish history from the Exodus onward, stressing the Jews’ powerful deliverance from Egyptian bondage, the providential occupation of their inheritance in **Canaan***,* the establishment of the monarchy, the removal of **Saul***,* and the special place of **David**.\n\n
13:22	idm143319					 David was **a man after** God’s **own heart** despite his sins (e.g., *2 Sam 11–12*).\n\n
13:23	idm143328					 Paul here moved to the theme of his message: **Jesus***,* one of **David’s descendants***,* was **God’s promised Savior of Israel**. The Messiah’s way had been prepared by **John the Baptist***,* who insisted that **Israel needed to repent . . . and turn to God and be baptized**. John was a humble servant who simply cleared the ground for the one whose **coming** he announced.\n\n
13:26	idm143343					 Paul reviewed the shameful treatment Jesus had received, involving unjust condemnation and death. **But God raised** Jesus **from the dead***,* as attested by **witnesses**. This message provides good news, for through Jesus sinners can experience the forgiveness of sins. But this message must be met with faith, or dire consequences will follow.\n\n
13:31	idm143353					 The fact that Jesus was raised from the dead was well documented by **witnesses**. \n\n
13:38	idm143360					 Paul appealed for them to believe the message about Jesus, through whom **there is forgiveness for your sins**.\n\n
13:39	idm143367					 Faith is prerequisite to being **made right in God’s sight***;* this was not provided for in **the law of Moses** (*Ps 14:1-3*; see *Rom 3:9-20*).\n\n
13:40	idm143378					 Paul closed his message with a strong warning (cp. *Heb 2:3*). The Good News must not be ignored, neglected, or rejected, or frightening consequences will follow.\n\n
13:42	idm143385					 The message stirred up interest among the people, and **many** of them were converted.\n\n
13:43	idm143392					 Full **converts to Judaism** (also called *proselytes*) were Gentiles who had gone through the rite of circumcision to become full members of the Jewish community, observing the Jewish law (see also *2:11*; *6:5*; *Matt 23:15*). • **The grace of God** is a key concept in the New Testament to describe God’s unmerited favor shown preeminently through Jesus Christ.\n\n
13:44	idm143404					 The excitement caused by the apostles’ preaching led to a mass turnout on the following week. This response provoked the jealousy of **some of the Jews** (cp. *4:1-2*; *5:17*), whose ability to win converts to Judaism (*13:43*) was being dwarfed by Paul’s ministry. They verbally attacked Paul and his ministry (cp. *6:8-12*; *18:6*; *19:9*; *Matt 23:13*). Paul met this hostility with a bold declaration that these Jews had had their opportunity to hear **the word of God***,* and that since they had rejected it, the offer of salvation would now be given **to the Gentiles** (cp. *Acts 10:34-35*), in accord with the Lord’s **command** in Scripture. The local Gentiles welcomed the Good News and many responded to it, so the Lord’s message was carried **throughout that region**.\n\n
13:50	idm143424					 Jewish opposition once again forced **Paul and Barnabas** . . . **out of town**. They **shook the dust from their feet as a sign of rejection***,* as Jesus had taught his disciples (see *Matt 10:14-15*; *Mark 6:11-12*; *Luke 9:5-6*; *10:10-11*). That place was then treated as pagan territory, and other people were given access to the message of new life in Christ.\n\n
13:52	idm143438					 Despite probable harassment and persecution, **the believers were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit** (cp. *5:41*; *16:23-25*; *Matt 5:10-12*; *2 Cor 8:2*; *1 Thes 1:6*).\n\n
14:1	idm143450					 The missionaries moved on to the next town, **Iconium** (now called Konya), located east of Pisidian Antioch on a high plateau in south central Asia Minor. Iconium enjoyed a favorable location on several key trade routes. • In their usual fashion, **Paul and Barnabas** began their ministry in the area by speaking powerfully in **the Jewish synagogue***,* which led to a great response from **both Jews and Greeks**.\n\n
14:2	idm143461					 Once again **Paul and Barnabas** faced hostile **Jews** who rejected the Christian **message** and also **poisoned the minds of the Gentiles**.\n\n
14:3	idm143471					 The Spirit-inspired **apostles** were resilient to withstand the verbal attack against them, and they persisted in **preaching** the Good News that God’s **grace** was available to Gentiles as well as to Jews. • **boldly:** Spirit-inspired boldness is evident throughout Acts (see *2:14*; *4:9-10*, *13*; *7:2-53*; *8:30-35*; *9:27-28*; *18:26*; *19:8*; *22:3-21*; *23:1-6*; *28:16-20*, *23-31*). • In addition, the Holy Spirit confirmed the Christian message with **miraculous signs and wonders** (cp. *5:12-16*; *15:12*; *16:18*; *19:11*).\n\n
14:4	idm143498					 The apostolic message required a decision about belief in Jesus, and **opinion** was clearly split. • Paul and Barnabas are called **apostles** for the first time (also in *14:14*), extending the idea of apostleship beyond the Twelve. Their message was in continuity with that of the original apostles, and they were prepared to suffer hardship and persecution for it as the earlier apostles had done (*5:41*; *14:19*; *20:24*; *21:13-14*; see also *Rom 8:35-38*; *2 Cor 4:8-17*).\n\n
14:6	idm143513					 **Lycaonia** was a southern region of the Roman province of Galatia. Its major cities were Lystra, Derbe, Laranda, and Iconium. Acts reports two more visits by Paul to Lycaonia (*16:1-5*; *18:23*). Paul’s letter to the Galatians was probably addressed to scattered believers in the churches of Lycaonia (see *Galatians Book Introduction*, “Recipients”). • **Lystra** was located roughly twenty-five miles (40 km) south-southwest of Iconium. • **Derbe***,* situated about thirty miles (50 km) southeast of Lystra, was on the busy major road that stretched from Iconium and Lystra eastward to Tarsus, the capital of Cilicia.\n\n
14:8	idm143526					 Paul’s healing of **a man with crippled feet** recalls a similar incident in *3:1-12*. In Acts, the work of Paul parallels the work of Peter, and the many miraculous signs and wonders performed among the Jews were also performed among the Gentiles.\n\n
14:9	idm143534					 **Paul realized he had faith to be healed:** Paul, full of the Holy Spirit (*9:17*), sensed the man’s spiritual openness and expectancy for divine help and intervention.\n\n
14:11	idm143542					 **Zeus** was the patron god of Lystra, and the city had a **temple** in his honor. They associated Barnabas with Zeus, perhaps because he was the more impressive figure, and **Hermes** was identified with **Paul** . . . **since he was the chief speaker**. The native people of Lystra thought that they were being treated to a divine visitation similar to a past mythological appearance cited by the poet Ovid (in which the gods Zeus and Hermes came to visit the area but were unrecognized except by an old couple; see Ovid, *Metamorphoses* 8.616–724). So the people set out to honor these supposed gods.\n\n
14:13	idm143554					 **The apostles** opposed the people’s idolatry and their attempt to **offer sacrifices** to them. They directed the people’s worship **to the living God***;* the apostles were his representatives as they brought **the Good News** of the Christian message.\n\n
14:19	idm143565					 The crowd became fickle when **some Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium** and easily turned the people against the apostles. • **They stoned Paul and dragged him out of town:** Paul later referred to this time of persecution as a lesson (*2 Tim 3:11-12*). • **thinking he was dead:** That Paul **got up and went back into the town** suggests that God miraculously healed him of his wounds.\n\n
14:20	idm143576					 **The next day he left:** Paul later returned to Lystra on his second missionary journey (*16:1*).\n\n
14:22	idm143584					 The apostles were diligent in following up with those who had made a Christian profession of faith. These new disciples needed to be nurtured, supported, and encouraged (*15:32*, *41*; *16:40*; *18:23*; see *1 Thes 3:2*; *4:18*; *5:14*). • **Paul and Barnabas** . . . **appointed elders:** See “*Church Leaders*” Theme Note.\n\n
14:26	idm143600					 As soon as Paul and Barnabas returned home to **Antioch** from their first missionary journey, they **called the church together** and gave a full report of their evangelism and discipleship. They humbly acknowledged divine guidance in opening **the door of faith to the Gentiles** (see *11:18*; *1 Cor 16:9*; *2 Cor 2:12*). Similar reports (*Acts 15:4*, *12*; *21:19*) always stressed the activity of God as working through the ministries of his servants (see *Rom 15:17-18*; *1 Cor 3:5-9*; *15:10-11*).\n\n
15:1	idm143618					 These **men from Judea** were Jewish Christians who taught the necessity of circumcision (and with it, conversion to Judaism) in order to be saved. The central issue was how Gentiles were to be received into Christian fellowship. Paul wrote his letter to the Galatians about this time to counter the same teaching in Galatia (see *Galatians Book Introduction*, “Date of Writing”).\n\n
15:2	idm143626					 The Antioch church decided **to send** . . . **delegates to Jerusalem** to resolve this matter in discussion with **the apostles and elders** there. En route, the entourage visited believers **in Phoenicia and Samaria***,* where the Christian faith had made substantial inroads (ch *8*).\n\n
15:4	idm143638					 The first council of the church met to resolve the dispute concerning Gentiles and circumcision (*15:1-2*).\n\n
15:5	idm143645					 These **Pharisees** were **believers***,* yet they retained their strong adherence to **the law of Moses**. Paul argued against their message most strenuously (see *Gal 1:6-9*; *2:14–3:14*).\n\n
15:7	idm143657					 **Peter***,* no doubt remembering his own experience in the household of Cornelius (ch *10*), argued that God had already **confirmed** his acceptance of the Gentiles without circumcision by **giving them the Holy Spirit.** The **undeserved grace of the Lord Jesus** had been made available to all.\n\n
15:13	idm143669					 **James***,* the brother of Jesus, declared that the conversion of the Gentiles was clearly in accord with Scripture. He argued forcefully that it was contrary to the divine will to put unnecessary requirements on the admission of the Gentiles.\n\n
15:14	idm143677					 **Peter:** Greek *Simeon.* Peter’s given name was Simon (see *Matt 16:17-19*).\n\n
15:15	idm143686					 Because God’s **prophets** had **predicted** the conversion and inclusion of **the Gentiles***,* James argued that the Gentiles should be accepted as Gentiles, without requiring them to practice Judaism (*15:1*).\n\n
15:20	idm143697					 **Eating food offered to idols** is sinful if it involves knowingly partaking of an idolatrous sacrifice (see *Exod 20:4*; *Deut 5:8*; *1 Cor 8:4-13*; *10:14-30*; *Rev 2:14*, *20*). • **Sexual immorality** was common in the Greek world but is always sinful (*Exod 20:14*; *Deut 5:18*; *Gal 5:19*). • **eating the meat of strangled animals:** God’s law prohibits eating meat that has blood in it (*Lev 17:13-14*) or **consuming blood** (*Lev 17:10-12*), “for the life of every creature is in its blood” (*Lev 17:14*). Also, “It is the blood, given in exchange for a life, that makes purification possible” (see *Lev 17:11* and *study note*). This command was first given to Noah, the ancestor of Gentiles as well as Jews (*Gen 9:4*).\n\n
15:22	idm143722					 The Jerusalem church chose **two of the church leaders to report** its **decision**. They took with them a letter **from the apostles and elders** . . . **in Jerusalem** explaining the terms of the agreement.\n\n
15:29	idm143732					 **Farewell:** The letter to the churches includes this familiar Hellenistic greeting at the end of a letter, found only here in the New Testament. Paul often ended his letters on a more theological note (e.g., *1 Cor 16:23-24*; *2 Cor 13:13*; see *Eph 6:23-24*; *Phil 4:23*; *Col 4:18*; *1 Thes 5:23-28*; *1 Tim 6:21*).\n\n
15:30	idm143746					 **The believers** at **Antioch** received the decision with **great joy** that conversion to Judaism and keeping all the requirements of the law of Moses was not required of them. The dispute had been resolved, so the work of teaching and preaching in Antioch could continue unimpeded.\n\n
15:36	idm143755					 The discordant separation of Paul and Barnabas is indicated by a very strong word in Greek (**their disagreement was so sharp**). It was an honest disagreement between two godly men about whether John Mark (Barnabas’s cousin, *Col 4:10*) should be given a second chance to accompany them on a mission journey after he **had deserted them in Pamphylia** (see *Acts 13:13*). The rift between Paul and John Mark was eventually healed (*2 Tim 4:11*).\n\n
15:40	idm143766					 Following his disagreement with Barnabas over John Mark, **Paul chose Silas** as his partner for a second missionary journey through **Syria and Cilicia**. The two men traveled overland to visit Derbe and Lystra, explaining the decision of the Jerusalem council and **strengthening** believers in their faith.\n\n
16:1	idm143775					 Paul returned to churches that he and Barnabas had established on their previous journey.\n\n
16:3	idm143781					 Paul had Timothy **circumcised** to enhance Timothy’s acceptance and effectiveness as a Jew in Jewish circles (contrast Titus, who was a full Gentile, *Gal 2:3*). Elsewhere Paul clarified that it makes no difference to God whether one is circumcised or not circumcised (*Rom 2:25-29*; *Gal 5:6*; *6:15*). Paul was prepared to use any legitimate means to communicate the Good News (*1 Cor 9:20-21*) to various audiences.\n\n
16:4	idm143793					 Paul and Silas faithfully communicated the **decisions** of the Jerusalem council. The wisdom of the decision was indicated as **the churches were strengthened in their faith and grew larger every day** (cp. *2:41*; *4:4*; *5:14*; *6:1*; *9:31*; *21:20*).\n\n
16:6	idm143807					 God directed the missionaries’ travels: **The Holy Spirit had prevented them** from proceeding westward into the province of Asia, **the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them to go** north to **Bithynia***,* and then **Paul had a vision** calling them to go northwest **over** the Aegean Sea **to Macedonia**. God’s Spirit guided his servants in Acts in a variety of ways, including divine visions (see also *9:10*; *10:9-16*; *22:18*), direct intuition (cp. *8:29*, *39*; *10:19*; *20:22*), counsel with other believers (cp. *15:29*), guidance through prayer (*13:2*, *4*), insight through Scripture (*28:25-27*), and prophecy (*11:28*). Guidance by the indwelling Holy Spirit helped them to accomplish their mission to be Christ’s witnesses (*1:8*; see also *4:8*, *31*; *11:24*; *13:9*).\n\n
16:8	idm143837					 **Troas**, a major port on the Aegean Sea, was one of the more significant cities in the Roman Empire. Paul’s strategy was often to visit principal places such as Troas, Athens, Corinth, and Ephesus. When the Christian faith had been planted in major centers, local Christian workers could carry it into outlying areas (e.g., Epaphras took the message from Ephesus to Colosse, *Col 1:7*; *4:12-13*).\n\n
16:9	idm143846					 **a vision:** See “*Visions*” Theme Note.\n\n
16:10	idm143854					 **we:** The most natural interpretation of the shift from “they” to “we” is that Luke accompanied Paul from Troas to Philippi (*16:10-17*). Later Luke joined Paul again at Philippi and sailed with him to Troas, then to Miletus (*20:5-15*), then from Miletus to Jerusalem (*21:1-18*). After Paul’s two-year imprisonment in Caesarea, Luke traveled with him to Rome (*27:1–28:16*).\n\n
16:11	idm143865					 **Samothrace** is a small mountainous **island** lying west-northwest of the Hellespont about twenty miles (32 km) from the coast of Thrace. • **Neapolis** (modern Kavala) was the seaport for Philippi and the eastern terminus of the famous *Via Egnatia* (the Egnatian Way), which ran from Rome to Asia.\n\n
16:12	idm143875					 At **Philippi***,* about ten miles (17 km) inland from Neapolis, Paul began his missionary labors in Europe.\n\n
16:13	idm143883					 Luke gives his readers cameos of three lives touched by the Good News in Philippi: a wealthy woman (*16:14-15*), an exploited slave girl (*16:16-21*), and a middle-class officer (*16:23-36*).\n\n
16:13	idm143892					 The Jewish community at Philippi was too small to have a synagogue, which required ten adult males. Instead, Jews met **for prayer** in an open space by the Gangites (now called Angista) River that afforded privacy, quiet, and water for Jewish purification rites.\n\n
16:14	idm143899					 The first person changed by Christ in Philippi was **Lydia***,* a successful businesswoman **from Thyatira** (modern Akhisar), a city of western Asia Minor famous for its woolen fabrics, weavers, and linens. Lydia responded to the message and **she and her household were baptized** (cp. *16:32-33*). • One of Lydia’s first acts as a **true believer in the Lord** was to extend hospitality to the visiting missionaries. Hospitality is an important Christian virtue (*Matt 25:31-46*; *Rom 12:13*; *16:23*; *1 Tim 3:2*; *Titus 1:8*; *Heb 13:2*; *1 Pet 4:9*; *3 Jn 1:5-8*; cp. *Gen 18:1-8*; *19:1-3*; *24:23-33*).\n\n
16:16	idm143922					 The second portrait of a changed life in Philippi is of a **slave girl who had a spirit that enabled her to tell the future**. • Even though the **demon within her** was stating the truth, Paul, like Jesus, did not permit it to proclaim the Christian message (cp. *Mark 1:25*, *34*; *3:11-12*; *Luke 4:35*, *41*). The Lord had commanded that the gospel be proclaimed by his disciples, not by opponents (*Acts 1:8*; *9:15*; *26:15-18*; *Matt 28:18-20*; *Luke 24:46-49*; *John 20:21*; see *Acts 22:15*).\n\n
16:19	idm143942					 As in the ministry of Jesus, sometimes the Good News threatened established commercial interests (see also *19:25-27*; *Mark 5:1-20*). The slave girl’s exploiters viciously attacked the missionaries and **dragged them before the authorities** as criminals, blamed them for fomenting a disturbance, resorted to racial bias (**these Jews**), and appealed to the Philippians’ pride (**us Romans***;* the Philippians prided themselves on being Roman citizens of a Roman colony). • **customs that are illegal:** By law, Jews were not permitted to make converts of Romans.\n\n
16:22	idm143955					 All reasonable security measures were taken to ensure that Paul and Silas **didn’t escape** after they had been **stripped and beaten with wooden rods** (see *22:24-26*; *2 Cor 6:5*; *11:23-25*). As at Christ’s tomb (*Matt 27:65*), however, human effort did not prevent divine intervention.\n\n
16:25	idm143967					 **Paul and Silas***,* like the persecuted apostles in Jerusalem, were joyful, “rejoicing that God had counted them worthy to suffer disgrace for the name of Jesus” (*5:41*).\n\n
16:26	idm143976					 The **massive earthquake** is reminiscent of the great earthquake at Jesus’ resurrection (*Matt 28:2-3*).\n\n
16:27	idm143984					 Luke’s third portrait in Philippi is of the Philippian **jailer** who, shaken by what had happened, responded in faith when challenged to accept **the Lord Jesus** and **be saved**. He was **baptized** with **his household** and rejoiced in his newfound faith as he reached out with hospitality to the preachers.\n\n
16:27	idm143995					 The Roman jailer clearly knew that his life could be forfeited if the prisoners for whom he was responsible escaped. This was standard practice (*12:19*; *27:42*; cp. *Code of Justinian* 9.4.4).\n\n
16:29	idm144004					 **Paul and Silas** had impressed **the jailer** with their cheerful faith (*16:25*), their composure in crisis, and their concern for his well-being (*16:28*). Whatever the jailer’s previous understanding of Paul’s message, God touched his heart, and he cried out for divine help.\n\n
16:31	idm144014					 Paul and Silas directed the jailer to a faith in Christ that brings blessing both to him and to his family. The whole household received Christian instruction, and their response was expressed in baptism and the offering of hospitality to Paul and Silas.\n\n
16:37	idm144020					 Paul and Silas were both **Roman citizens***,* so the beating and imprisonment (*16:22-24*) had been illegal. After the city officials learned of this, they were justifiably alarmed because they had committed a crime against Rome. • **Let them come themselves to release us:** Paul made use of his rights as a Roman citizen in order to clear his name and ensure that no disrepute would attach to the Christian message or those who accepted it. Luke intended to show that Christianity should enjoy the same status as Judaism in the Roman Empire as a permitted religion—the Christian faith was compatible with the life of a Roman citizen. Accordingly, it was important to note that Paul made use of his rights as a Roman citizen (cp. *22:25-27*) and was ready to use the privileges of citizenship to advance the cause of Christ in a hostile world.\n\n
16:40	idm144031					 This meeting in **the home of Lydia** bolstered the spirits of the Philippian Christians who had to deal with the fallout from the missionaries’ work there.\n\n
17:1	idm144038					 After traveling through Macedonia to **Thessalonica***,* Paul preached to the Jews first (*Rom 1:16*) in the synagogue. Here, as elsewhere, there was a mixed response.\n\n
17:1	idm144047					 **Amphipolis** was a Roman military post located on the Egnatian Way in the northeastern part of Macedonia. • **Apollonia***,* named after the Greek god Apollo, was also situated on the Egnatian Way. • **Thessalonica** offered a starting point for ministry because it had **a Jewish synagogue** (see *study note on 9:2*). Paul was able to preach for **three** consecutive **Sabbaths***,* explaining **the Scriptures** and showing their fulfillment in Jesus.\n\n
17:4	idm144063					 **God-fearing Greek men:** See *study note on 10:2*. • Luke regularly draws attention to **women** who joined the Christian movement (*17:4*, *12*, *34*; see also *5:14*; *8:12*; *16:13-15*, *31-34*; *18:26*; *21:9*).\n\n
17:5	idm144081					 Once again, the enemies of the Christian faith saw it as a disruptive threat (cp. *16:19-21*). Ironically, **they gathered some troublemakers** and then accused Paul and Silas of causing **trouble** by disturbing the peace and committing **treason against Caesar**—serious charges of threatening the stability of the empire (cp. *Luke 23:2*).\n\n
17:8	idm144092					 The charges did not hold up under scrutiny, so the officials **released** **Jason and the other believers** after they posted **bond**. Christianity, Luke contended, was politically harmless to the Roman Empire and should therefore be recognized as a permitted religion and not subjected to political attack.\n\n
17:10	idm144101					 In light of the strong opposition in Thessalonica, **the believers sent Paul and Silas** **to Berea***,* located about fifty miles (80.5 km) west of Thessalonica. There the missionaries had a better reception than in Thessalonica. Many Jews came to faith, as well as **many of the prominent Greek women and men**. The Bereans were exemplary in their attitude, for they were **open-minded** and eager to learn, good listeners, diligent Bible students, and thoughtful people. Their resulting faith had a strong foundation.\n\n
17:13	idm144112					 Paul acknowledged the determination and persistence of this persecution when he wrote to the Thessalonians (*1 Thes 2:14-16*).\n\n
17:16	idm144119					 In this chapter, we see Paul presented as a model witness for Christ, engaging the thinkers of his day and challenging them with the Christian message. Paul quoted writers his audience would be familiar with and showed the relevance of the gospel by dialoguing with them, critiquing their assumptions, and offering Jesus as a constructive alternative (see *Col 1:28*). Paul reminded these proud intellectuals that there is a living God to whom all human beings are answerable; that they will be judged by him through Jesus, whom God raised from the dead; and that they should therefore repent and put their faith in Jesus.\n\n
17:16	idm144126					 **Athens***,* like Alexandria and Tarsus, prided itself on its intellectual sophistication in examining ideas and considering the different philosophies that were current at the time.\n\n
17:18	idm144134					 **Epicurean . . . philosophers:** Epicureanism was a popular school of Greek philosophy, founded by Epicurus (341–270 BC). Epicureans believed that the principal aim of life was to secure happiness. They thought of pleasure not in terms of sensual indulgence, as their critics charged, but in terms of tranquility. Their contemporaries often called them atheists; in their view, there were no gods to fear, and death simply marked the end of human existence. They sought their security in organized communities where they could live in contentment apart from society. • **Stoic philosophers:** Stoicism was founded by Zeno of Citium (335–263 BC) and became the most influential philosophy in the Greco-Roman world. It viewed the universe as permeated by Reason (sometimes referred to as God or Providence). Stoicism saw divine Reason as expressed in human reason and held that as humans made progress, they could advance from ignorance (the source of vice) to true knowledge (the source of virtue). They developed extensive lists of virtues and vices and produced detailed household codes to guide family behavior. Paul’s teaching resembles that of the Stoics in his use of household codes and lists of virtues and vices (*Gal 5:19-23*; *Eph 5:22-33*; *Col 3:18–4:1*; *1 Tim 3:1-13*; *5:1–6:1*). However, Paul’s message of Good News—focusing on the life, death, and **resurrection** of Jesus Christ—was **strange** and **foreign** to these Greek philosophers. • The air of superiority with which they addressed Paul as **this babbler** indicates their arrogance.\n\n
17:22	idm144153					 Paul’s remarkable sermon in Athens reveals his versatility in preaching the Good News (*Rom 11:14*; *1 Cor 9:19-23*; *10:33*; cp. *Acts 16:3*; *17:2-3*; *21:20-26*). While Paul’s Greek audience did not know the Scriptures or have a tradition of monotheism as the Jews did, they did have a rich intellectual heritage. So Paul established a point of contact on the basis of an Athenian inscription to an **Unknown God**. He then explained God’s nature as the Creator (*17:22-29*), followed by God’s purpose as the Redeemer (*17:30-31*). • As he did elsewhere in his own writings (see *1 Cor 15:33*; *Titus 1:12*), Paul made use of the Greek poets. There are several points of connection in this sermon with the *Hymn to Zeus* by Cleanthes (about 315–240 BC). Paul was probably quoting Epimenides, who had declared about God, “**In him we live and move and exist**” (Epimenides, *Cretica,* about 600 BC). Paul also cited Aratus, a Stoic poet from Cilicia (about 315–240 BC), who had commented, “**We are his offspring**” (Aratus, *Phaenomena* 5). These allusions to their **own poets** established connections with his audience. Paul was then able to present the singular nature of God (*Acts 17:29*), and he stressed the coming judgment through Jesus Christ, whom God had raised from the dead. This message, while touching on Greek culture and philosophy, had a clear focus on Christ that presented the challenge of Christ to a cultured and intellectual but idolatrous people.\n\n
17:30	idm144180					 The idea of **people’s ignorance** is carefully discussed both in the Old Testament law (*Lev 4:2*, *22*, *27*; *5:15*, *17*; *Num 15:25*, *27*) and in the New Testament (*Eph 4:18*; *1 Pet 1:14*; *2:15*; *2 Pet 3:5*, *8*). Paul was particularly fervent about combatting ignorance (see *Rom 10:13-15*; *11:25*; *1 Cor 10:1*; *12:1*; *2 Cor 1:8*; *1 Thes 4:13*). The message of Good News overcomes ignorance and summons all who hear it to **repent of their sins and turn to** God (see *Acts 2:38*).\n\n
17:32	idm144207					 The Athenians listened carefully until **Paul** spoke of **the resurrection of the dead** (*17:31*); at that point some **laughed** or mocked, for the notion of resurrection was foolish to Greek ears (see *1 Cor 15:12-19*). Similarly, the Jews in Jerusalem later listened carefully to Paul until he mentioned God’s acceptance of the Gentiles (*Acts 22:22*). These are examples of how the message of Good News can offend people because of their prejudices (see *1 Cor 1:20-25*).\n\n
17:34	idm144220					 **some joined him and became believers:** Paul’s sermon was not without positive response. Two prominent converts are mentioned: **Dionysius** and **Damaris**. Luke often placed a man and a woman in juxtaposition (e.g., *5:1-11*; *17:4*, *12*; *Luke 14:1-6*; *15:3-10*). • Dionysius was **a member of the council** of the Areopagus, the highest governing body of Athens.\n\n
18:1	idm144235					 Paul spent eighteen fruitful months preaching and teaching in **Corinth***,* first in the synagogue and then **next door** in the house of **Titius Justus** (*18:1-11*). Then, in court, Paul won a significant victory over his enemies (*18:12-17*).\n\n
18:1	idm144247					 In Roman times, Greek political power in Achaia resided in **Corinth***,* a prominent city-state and major commercial city. Corinth was notorious for its prostitution, immorality, and drunkenness (see *1 Corinthians Book Introduction*, “Setting”). Paul invested much time and effort establishing a Christian community in Corinth (see *study note on Acts 16:8*).\n\n
18:2	idm144257					 The edict of **Claudius Caesar** that had **deported all Jews from Rome** around AD 49 is mentioned by the Roman historian Suetonius (*Life of Claudius* 25). • **Aquila** and **Priscilla** became an outstanding husband-and-wife team in the early church. They earned their living as **tentmakers,** as did Paul, who probably **lived and worked with them** during his year and a half in Corinth (*18:11*; see *Rom 16:3-4*; *1 Cor 16:19*). • **just as he was:** Paul would have been trained as a tentmaker as a young man. It was Jewish custom to provide sons with a manual trade, including young men who intended to become rabbis or other professionals.\n\n
18:4	idm144275					 Once again Paul followed his custom of **preaching** to **the Jews** first, and then reaching out to **Gentiles** after he met with rejection and opposition (*13:42-49*; see *3:25-26*; *26:20*; *Rom 1:16*; *2:10*; *3:29*, *30*; *4:9-12*). • Paul probably wrote his letters to the Thessalonian Christians **after Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia** with a report of how things were going there (see *1 Thes 3:6*; *2 Thessalonians Book Introduction*, “Setting”).\n\n
18:7	idm144295					 **Titius Justus** (“Titus the Just”) was a **Gentile who worshiped God** (a “God-fearer”; see *study note on 10:2*). Because Titus was a common Roman name, *Justus* differentiates him from the better-known Titus, Paul’s co-worker (*2 Cor 2:13*; *7:6*, *13*; *8:6*, *16*, *23*; Titus).\n\n
18:9	idm144311					 Paul had experienced real opposition in Corinth (*18:6*) and apparently was afraid of being attacked again, so the divine message was a comfort to him (cp. *23:11*; *Ps 34:4*, *7*, *19*; *Matt 28:20*), encouraging him to persist in his public ministry and promising God’s protection (cp. *Ps 91:11*; *2 Tim 4:17*).\n\n
18:12	idm144325					 The **governor of Achaia***,* Junio **Gallio***,* was the older brother of the Roman philosopher Seneca (Seneca was a tutor to Emperor Nero). An inscription indicating that he was governor around AD 51–52 helps to date Paul’s visit in Corinth to about that time.\n\n
18:14	idm144336					 Gallio’s ruling indicated that the charges against Paul were unjustified. The Roman government had nothing to fear from acknowledging Christianity as a legal religion.\n\n
18:17	idm144342					 It is most likely that the Greeks beat **Sosthenes** to express their hostility to the Jews; it is possible that the Jews attacked their own synagogue leader because he was unsuccessful in pleading their case. Sosthenes may be the same man Paul later mentions as “our brother” (*1 Cor 1:1*), but it is uncertain, as the name was fairly common.\n\n
18:18	idm144350					 **Cenchrea** was a seaport located on the Aegean Sea, roughly five miles (8 km) east of **Corinth**. It was here that Paul **shaved his head according to Jewish custom** to mark the completion of a temporary Nazirite **vow** (cp. *21:23-24*; see *Num 6:1-21*; *Judg 13:4-7*; *16:1*; *Amos 2:11-12*; *Luke 1:15*).\n\n
18:19	idm144366					 Paul made a quick stop at **Ephesus***,* the most important city in the Roman province of Asia. There he **left the others behind***,* including Priscilla and Aquila (*18:26*). He sailed to Judea, landing at **Caesarea***,* the headquarters of the Roman forces of occupation. After a visit to **the church at Jerusalem***,* Paul returned to **Antioch***,* the church that had originally commissioned him. This marked the end of his second missionary journey. In Antioch, he spent a rewarding time of reporting what God had done through him and his colleagues, sharing the excitement and challenges of their work with the home church. Then **after** . . . **some time***,* Paul began his third missionary journey. He went by land rather than by sea, traveling **through Galatia and Phrygia** and revisiting **believers** whom he had led to faith in Christ on his previous trips. It was important to him that these young converts not be left to founder and shipwreck their faith (see *Eph 6:10-20*; *1 Tim 1:18-20*; *2 Tim 1:15*; *4:10*).\n\n
18:21	idm144392					 **“I will come back later”:** Paul later spent significant time in Ephesus during his third missionary journey (*19:1–20:1*; see *19:8*, *10*).\n\n
18:23	idm144402					 This section describes Paul’s third missionary journey (about AD 53–57). Paul revisited Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening the disciples (*18:23*). He then traveled to Ephesus (*19:1*), where he remained for over two years (*19:8-10*).\n\n
18:23	idm144412					 Paul wanted to keep in touch with earlier converts and strengthen their faith.\n\n
18:24	idm144418					 **Alexandria***,* the second-largest city in the Roman Empire, was famous for its rhetorical tradition and the philosophical work of Philo. Apollos was **an eloquent speaker** with an excellent knowledge of **the Scriptures** (the Old Testament). His knowledge about Jesus and the Holy Spirit was inadequate, though. He did not understand that believers could experience and enjoy the power of the Holy Spirit as a present energizing reality. Fortunately, **Priscilla and Aquila** took him aside and corrected his spiritual understanding.\n\n
19:1	idm144429					 **Paul traveled** to **Ephesus** after **Apollos** had left. Subsequently, Apollos returned to Ephesus while Paul was still working there (*1 Cor 16:12*). The two men had different personalities, gifts, and roles, but God worked through both of them. • Some **believers** in Ephesus still had an inadequate understanding of the Christian faith (cp. *Acts 18:26*) and did not **receive the Holy Spirit when** they **believed**. They had accepted **John’s baptism***,* which **called for repentance from sin***,* but had not received Christian baptism, which included the gift of the Holy Spirit. When Paul had instructed them further, they were able to receive Christian baptism (*19:5*) and the Holy Spirit (*19:6*).\n\n
19:6	idm144449					 When Paul **laid his hands on them** they received the **Holy Spirit, spoke in other tongues** and **prophesied***,* thereby experiencing the same filling with God’s power and presence that the disciples had received on the day of Pentecost (*2:4*, *11*).\n\n
19:10	idm144461					 Paul probably wrote 1 Corinthians during this time (see *1 Corinthians Book Introduction*, “Date and Occasion of Writing”).\n\n
19:11	idm144468					 Paul, like other Christian evangelists (*3:1-11*; *4:22*; *5:12-16*; *6:8*; *8:6-7*, *13*; *9:33-42*), performed **unusual miracles**. • **evil spirits were expelled:** As Jesus and Peter had done (cp. *5:16*; *Mark 1:21-34*; *Luke 4:31-37*).\n\n
19:13	idm144486					 Paul’s effectiveness is contrasted with the impotence of the traveling Jewish exorcists, who used **the name of Jesus** as though it were magical but did not have a relationship with him or the indwelling power of the Holy Spirit (cp. *Matt 12:27*; *Mark 9:38-39*; *Luke 9:49-50*; *11:19*).\n\n
19:17	idm144497					 The contrast between Paul and the Jewish exorcists was not lost on the people of Ephesus, **Jews and Greeks alike**. The resulting **fear** caused the inhabitants to honor and respect **the name of the Lord Jesus**. It led many to confess and forsake **their sinful practices***,* including **sorcery**.\n\n
19:20	idm144509					 Luke’s summary of the success of the Good News in Ephesus is short but pungent (cp. *2:43-47*; *5:14*; *6:7*; *9:31*; *12:24*; *16:5*; see *Rom 1:16*). When the Christian faith overcame problems of internal dissension, idolatry, and pagan practices, it **spread widely** and grew rapidly.\n\n
19:21	idm144523					 **felt compelled by the Spirit:** No doubt Paul was troubled by what he had heard about the situation in Corinth (see *1 Corinthians Book Introduction*). Instead of going immediately himself, **he sent** . . . **Timothy***,* who was carrying a letter, 1 Corinthians, from Paul to the Corinthians (*1 Cor 4:17*; *16:10-11*). Paul himself did **go over to Macedonia and Achaia** not long afterward (*Acts 20:1-3*). • **“I must go on to Rome!”:** Perhaps compelled by his proven strategy (see *study note on 16:8*), Paul wanted to proclaim the Good News in the most significant city in the world.\n\n
19:23	idm144540					 The patron deity of **Ephesus** was **the Greek goddess Artemis.** Her birthplace was believed to be Ephesus, so Ephesus was the **official guardian of the temple**. Twice annually, elaborate festivals were held in her honor with athletic, musical, and theatrical celebrations that included singing **Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!** The temple of Artemis at Ephesus was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Conversions to Christianity clearly damaged the worship of Artemis and the associated economic activity, but it became clear that Paul and his associates had committed no crime.\n\n
19:23	idm144550					 **the Way:** See *study note on 9:2*.\n\n
19:24	idm144558					 **Demetrius, a silversmith** whose **business** was threatened by Paul’s proclaiming faith in one God, whipped up a major riot against him.\n\n
19:24	idm144566					 **Silver** coins and **shrines** carrying the image of **Artemis** were minted in Ephesus; statuettes of the goddess were used in civic processions and are still sold there today.\n\n
19:27	idm144575					 **all around the world:** The ancient geographer Strabo reports that temples dedicated to Artemis existed in cities from Asia Minor (now Turkey) to what is now France and Spain (Strabo, *Geography* 3.4.8; 4.1.4).\n\n
19:29	idm144583					 Archaeologists have excavated the **amphitheater** where **the whole city** assembled; it held 24,000 people.\n\n
19:31	idm144591					 **Some of the officials of the province** (Greek Asiarchai, “rulers of Asia”): The “Asiarchs” were the appointed leaders in the Roman province of Asia. They served as civic benefactors and usually championed the emperor cult. Some of these officials in high places were **friends of Paul**—Luke highlights that Christianity was attractive to people of high standing in society.\n\n
19:35	idm144600					 The demonstration was finally quelled only when the **mayor** intervened and **dismissed** the assembly to prevent the city from being charged by **the Roman government** with **rioting**. This story demonstrates that Christians in the Roman world were entitled to legal due process.\n\n
19:35	idm144610					 The tradition that the **image** (statue) of **Artemis** had fallen **from heaven** might point to its having been carved from a meteor.\n\n
20:1	idm144619					 Paul traveled to **Macedonia***,* where he **encouraged the believers in all the towns***,* including Thessalonica, Philippi, and Berea. He also continued to gather the offering for the needy in Jerusalem (see *Rom 15:25-28*; *2 Cor 8:1–9:15*). Titus met Paul in Macedonia with a report from Corinth, which prompted Paul to write 2 Corinthians and send Titus back carrying it (*2 Cor 7:5-7*; *8:6*).\n\n
20:2	idm144633					 From Macedonia, Paul **traveled down to Greece**—i.e., Corinth in the province of Achaia (see *study note on 18:1*)—**where he stayed for three months** (cp. *2 Cor 13:1*). Paul probably wrote his letter to the Romans during this time (see *Romans Book Introduction*, “Date, Place, and Occasion of Writing”). • **a plot . . . against his life:** Cp. *Acts 9:23-25*, *28-30*; *23:12-35*; *25:3*.\n\n
20:4	idm144649					 Paul’s traveling companions were disciples from Berea, Thessalonica, Derbe, and Asia, whom he was mentoring and equipping to lead (cp. *2 Tim 2:2*).\n\n
20:5	idm144656					 This is another of the “we” passages in Acts (see *study note on 16:10*). Luke apparently rejoined Paul at Philippi, where Luke had remained several years earlier, and journeyed with Paul to Jerusalem (*21:1-18*).\n\n
20:7	idm144664					 **On the first day of the week** the early church commemorated Jesus’ resurrection (see *Mark 16:9*; cp. *John 20:19*; *Rev 1:10*). • This was Paul’s last visit to Troas, which included gathering **to share in the Lord’s Supper.** This meal probably included both communion and a common meal (cp. *Acts 2:42*, *46*; *Jude 1:12*). • The remarkable feature of this gathering was the understated miraculous restoration of **Eutychus***,* the **young man** who fell **asleep** on a **windowsill** and **dropped three stories to his death** (cp. *Acts 9:36-41*).\n\n
20:13	idm144685					 **Assos** was a key city in Mysia on the east coast of the Aegean Sea. • **Mitylene** was the most strategic city on the island of Lesbos. • The island of **Samos** was of major importance on the trade routes from Asia Minor to the west and from the Aegean Sea to Egypt.\n\n
20:16	idm144694					 **The Festival of Pentecost** was one of the three Jewish pilgrimage festivals (see *study note on 2:1-4*). \n\n
20:17	idm144702					 **Miletus** was a major port on the western coast of Asia Minor at the mouth of the Meander River. It provided a place for Paul to meet briefly with the **elders** of Ephesus on his way to Jerusalem.\n\n
20:18	idm144710					 Paul’s address to the elders of the church of Ephesus is a testimony regarding his life and ministry in Ephesus, calling for similar dedication from the leaders who would carry on the ministry. The sermon highlights Paul’s integrity and pastoral **care** (*20:18-21*, *26*, *31*), speaks about the future (*20:22-23*, *25*, *29-30*), warns against **false teachers** (*20:29-30*), and exhorts the elders to be watchful and faithful (*20:28*, *31*). Paul modeled sacrificial, conscientious, servant leadership.\n\n
20:23	idm144727					 **the Holy Spirit tells me:** See, e.g., *21:10-12*.\n\n
20:26	idm144735					 **I have been faithful. If anyone suffers eternal death, it’s not my fault:** Cp. *Ezek 3:16-21*.\n\n
20:28	idm144743					 Paul refers to the church as **God’s people** and **God’s flock** (cp. *1 Pet 2:25*; *5:2*, *4*). Elsewhere the church is called *the body of Christ* (*1 Cor 12:27*; *Eph 1:23*; *4:12*; *Col 1:24*); the *bride* of Christ (*2 Cor 11:2*; *Rev 19:7*; see *Eph 5:25-32*); *the temple of the living God* (*1 Cor 3:16*; *2 Cor 6:16*); *a chosen people*, *royal priests, a holy nation, God’s very own possession* (*1 Pet 2:9*); and *God’s field*, *God’s building* (*1 Cor 3:9*). • Paul expected the **leaders** to feed and shepherd the church **over which the Holy Spirit** had appointed them as leaders (see *1 Tim 3:1-7*; *Titus 1:5-7*; *1 Pet 5:1-4*; cp. *Acts 6:2-4*).\n\n
20:29	idm144778					 **vicious wolves:** Paul’s prophecy did in fact happen, prompting him to write to Timothy in Ephesus some five years later (see *1 Tim 1:3-7*, *19-20*; *4:1-5*; see also *Matt 7:15*; *10:16*; *Mark 13:22*; *Luke 10:3*; *2 Pet 2:1-22*; *3:3*).\n\n
20:35	idm144794					 **‘It is more blessed to give than to receive’:** This saying of Jesus is not recorded in the Gospels.\n\n
20:38	idm144801					 The poignancy of the occasion was heightened by awareness that **they would never see him again** (*20:25*).\n\n
21:1	idm144809					 This “we” passage (see study notes on *16:10*; *20:5-15*) covers Paul’s journey from Miletus to Jerusalem at the close of the third missionary journey.\n\n
21:1	idm144817					 **Cos** was an island in the Aegean Sea with a major trade port. • **Rhodes** is a large Aegean island that featured the Colossus, a huge statue 100 feet (30 meters) tall that once stood at the entrance to the city. In Paul’s time, the statue lay where it had fallen during an earthquake over 200 years earlier; it would not be removed for another 600 years. • **Patara** was the major port of Lycia, located on the coast opposite Rhodes.\n\n
21:2	idm144826					 **Tyre** was an important port in **Phoenicia** with a maritime empire of far-flung commercial interests (see *Isa 23*; *Jer 25:15-38*; *47*; *Zech 9*; *Matt 15:21-28*; *Mark 7:24-31*).\n\n
21:4	idm144840					 The **local believers** at Tyre gave Paul a touching farewell that reveals deep Christian fellowship. • **prophesied through the Holy Spirit that Paul should not go on to Jerusalem:** The believers at Tyre clearly foresaw the danger in Paul’s visiting Jerusalem and out of brotherly concern tried to dissuade him. Paul willingly accepted the risks in order to fulfill his apostolic mandate (cp. *Phil 3:7-10*). See also *study note on Acts 21:11-14*.\n\n
21:7	idm144850					 Paul visited **Ptolemais***,* an important city on the coast of the Mediterranean, as he made his way from **Tyre** to Caesarea.\n\n
21:8	idm144859					 **Philip** had the title of **Evangelist** due to his evangelistic activity (*8:4-40*; cp. *Eph 4:11*; *2 Tim 4:5*).\n\n
21:9	idm144870					 Philip’s daughters’ **gift of prophecy** demonstrated the fulfillment of Joel’s prophecy, as Peter had preached at Pentecost (*2:17-21*; *Joel 2:28-32*).\n\n
21:10	idm144879					 Luke juxtaposes female prophets (*21:9*) with a male prophet (see *study note on 17:34*). **Agabus**, like the Old Testament prophets, used symbolic actions to proclaim his message (see “*Prophetic Sign Acts*” Theme Note).\n\n
21:11	idm144889					 Despite Agabus’s prediction of suffering and the believers’ begging Paul not to go to Jerusalem, Paul was resolutely ready **even to die for the sake of the Lord Jesus**. Luke stresses Paul’s courage, determination, and heroism as a Christian missionary who would let nothing interfere with his mission. See *study note on 21:4-6*.\n\n
21:18	idm144897					 It was important for **James** and **all the elders of the Jerusalem church** to hear of Paul’s successful mission **among the Gentiles** and for the mother church to continue to endorse this effort (*21:20*; see *15:7-21*). Paul’s report communicated that **God had accomplished** his purposes **among the Gentiles through** Paul’s **ministry**.\n\n
21:20	idm144911					 The Jerusalem church leaders urged Paul to strengthen his credibility by demonstrating that he was not teaching Jews **to turn their backs on the laws of Moses**. At the same time, no attempt was made to force Jewish rules on Gentile converts—those terms had been set previously (*15:22-29*) and were simply to be honored.\n\n
21:26	idm144919					 The concerns of the Christian leaders (*21:20-25*) were evidently well based, for **when their vows** were almost completed, **some Jews from the province of Asia** raised a mob against Paul with false charges. They were intent on killing Paul, but the Roman **commander** rescued him.\n\n
21:28	idm144929					 **Gentiles:** It was a crime punishable by death to bring any non-Jew into the Temple precincts beyond the Court of the Gentiles (see also Josephus, *War* 5.5.2; 6.2.4). The Jews **assumed** that Paul had violated this sacred law by bringing **Trophimus, a Gentile from Ephesus** (see also *Acts 20:4*; *2 Tim 4:20*), into the forbidden area.\n\n
21:30	idm144941					 This supposed desecration of the Temple aroused the fury of the Jewish populace. The **Temple** . . . **gates were closed** because they thought the Temple had been defiled by a Gentile.\n\n
21:31	idm144949					 **commander:** Or *tribune*, a Roman officer who commanded 1,000 men.\n\n
21:34	idm144957					 The **fortress** of Antonia, a large military garrison built by Herod the Great on the northwest corner of the Temple Mount, accommodated the Roman cohort that was stationed there to keep the peace.\n\n
21:37	idm144964					 **The commander** had mistaken Paul for an **Egyptian** false messiah who had planned to seize power from the Romans around AD 54 (roughly three years earlier; see Josephus, *War* 2.13.5). Paul corrected the mistake, gained permission to speak to the people, and addressed the crowd in **Aramaic,** the common language of Judea. He gave a strong statement of his faith in Jesus as the Messiah (*Acts 22:1-21*).\n\n
22:1	idm144976					 Paul’s premier defense of his life and faith before his own people in Jerusalem illustrates his flexibility as a missionary, just as his speech to the Greek philosophers in Athens had done (*17:22-31*; see *1 Cor 9:20-23*). Paul begins by recognizing his kinship with his people, explaining his Jewish background and training under the noted rabbi **Gamaliel** the Elder and describing his zealous desire **to honor God in everything***,* which they shared (*Acts 22:1-3*). Paul then describes his persecution of Christians (*22:4-5*), the revelation of Jesus to him on the way to **Damascus** (*22:6-10*), and his conversion (*22:11-16*). Paul ends his speech by describing his conversation with the Lord in the Temple. The Lord had predicted the Jews’ rejection of the message and had sent Paul to the **Gentiles** (*22:17-21*).\n\n
22:3	idm144994					 **under Gamaliel:** See *study note on 5:34*.\n\n
22:12	idm145002					 **Ananias:** See *study note on 9:17*.\n\n
22:14	idm145010					 **the Righteous One:** See also *3:14*; *7:52*; *1 Jn 2:1*. Righteousness was one of the Messiah’s characteristics (see *Isa 32:1*; *53:11*).\n\n
22:16	idm145022					 **be baptized. Have your sins washed away:** See “*Baptism*” Theme Note.\n\n
22:17	idm145030					 While Paul was praying **in the Temple***,* he **saw a vision of Jesus** telling him that the **people** of **Jerusalem** would not **accept** his **testimony**. The Lord then sent him **to the Gentiles**. The crowd’s response to this report (*22:22-23*) proved the point.\n\n
22:23	idm145045					 The crowd’s yelling, throwing off **their coats***,* and tossing **handfuls of dust into the air** were probably ritual responses to perceived blasphemy. They opposed and tried to thwart Paul’s words that suggested the inclusion of Gentiles (*22:21*). Cp. *Luke 4:16-30*.\n\n
22:25	idm145056					 Paul claimed his status as a **Roman citizen** at this critical time when he was about to be tortured to make him confess his supposed crime. Roman citizenship was a valuable asset, and claiming it falsely was a capital offense. Its principal benefits were the prohibition of scourging and the right to appeal to the emperor (*25:11*). **The commander was frightened** at having nearly violated Roman law (cp. *16:35-39*).\n\n
22:28	idm145066					 **it cost me plenty!** During the early part of the reign of Emperor Claudius (AD 41–54), Roman citizenship could be purchased, but it was expensive.\n\n
23:1	idm145074					 In addressing **the high council,** Paul insisted on his personal integrity **before God**—he had not violated God’s law or done the things they accused him of doing.\n\n
23:2	idm145082					 **Ananias** was the Jewish **high priest** from AD 47 to 58. • **slap him:** He apparently assumed that Paul was lying and tried to intimidate him.\n\n
23:3	idm145092					 **you corrupt hypocrite:** Cp. *Ezek 13:10-17*; *Matt 23:27*.\n\n
23:5	idm145101					 Why Paul did not recognize the **high priest** is not known. • **Paul replied** by quoting *Exod 22:28*, acknowledging the respect to which the high priest was entitled by virtue of his office.\n\n
23:6	idm145110					 Paul focused on the key issue in his trial, the **hope** of **resurrection** from **the dead**. His preaching was simply the outworking of that hope and the fact of Jesus’ resurrection, but the message was unacceptable to both groups of Jews because of its implications. **Pharisees** could not abide the inclusion of the Gentiles apart from circumcision and keeping the law of Moses (cp. *15:5*), but that was what the resurrection of Jesus and the outpouring of the Spirit had provided (*Acts 2:39*; *10:34-48*). **Sadducees** could not stand the proclamation of the resurrection at all (cp. *4:1-2*).\n\n
23:7	idm145125					 Paul’s statement (*23:6*) **divided the council***,* with the **Pharisees** taking Paul’s side against the **Sadducees**. The resulting **uproar** was so great that the commander rescued Paul and took him back into the **fortress** of Antonia.\n\n
23:11	idm145138					 At this critical juncture, Jesus encouraged Paul to continue as his faithful **witness** by assuring him that he would go to **Rome** (see *19:21*).\n\n
23:12	idm145147					 The plan to kill Paul was desperate, as **a group of . . . more than forty** took **an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul** (cp. *1 Sam 14:24-46*; *Matt 14:6-11*; see also *Deut 23:21-23*; *Matt 5:33-37*; *Jas 5:12*).\n\n
23:16	idm145160					 **Paul’s nephew** thwarted the murderous plot by reporting it to one of the **Roman officers**.\n\n
23:23	idm145168					 A mounted escort took Paul safely to the Roman **Governor Felix** in **Caesarea***,* the Roman headquarters for Judea. There Paul would have greater protection than in Jerusalem. The military operation was executed **that night** with secret efficiency and maximum security (*23:31*).\n\n
23:24	idm145179					 Antonius **Felix** was procurator (**Governor**) of Judea about AD 52–59, with responsibility for both military and civil affairs. Felix had a bad reputation (see *24:24-27*) and was eventually recalled to Rome by Nero.\n\n
23:26	idm145189					 The letter of **Claudius Lysias** to **Governor Felix** is a typical Hellenistic letter, naming the writer and the person addressed, offering a greeting, and stating the business at hand (though there is no parting word of farewell; see *study note on 15:29*). It summarizes the events that preceded it and explains the action taken; it also suggests that the commander has followed proper Roman judicial procedure. • The title **his Excellency** was often applied to persons of high social, political, or economic status (*Luke 1:3*).\n\n
23:31	idm145200					 **Antipatris***,* a city rebuilt by Herod the Great in 9 BC on the Plain of Sharon, was a convenient military control point between Jerusalem and Caesarea.\n\n
23:35	idm145209					 **The governor** followed the proper protocol and waited for Paul’s **accusers** to arrive before granting an official hearing. • **Herod’s headquarters** was Herod the Great’s palace at Caesarea; it subsequently became the residence of the Roman governors of Judea.\n\n
24:1	idm145218					 **Tertullus** presented a legal case against Paul in a Roman court on behalf of **the high priest** (*24:1-9*). Then Paul cheerfully made his **defense** and defended his faith (*24:10-21*), and the governor adjourned the hearing without a decision and **left Paul in prison** for two years (*24:22-27*).\n\n
24:1	idm145231					 **Tertullus** presented the case for the prosecution, beginning with the customary speech of praise intended to attract the attention and sympathy of the **governor**, followed by the statement of charges (*24:5-8*).\n\n
24:5	idm145240					 **Troublemaker** (or *agitator*) was a charge of political sedition. A Roman court would have taken this charge very seriously (see *16:21*; *17:7*; *18:13*). Similar accusations were made against Jesus before Pilate (*Luke 23:2*, *5*, *14*). • The term **cult** (or *party*, or *sect*) is used here in a negative sense to put Paul’s religion under a pallor of suspicion if not illegality (see also *Acts 24:14*).\n\n
24:6	idm145258					 **trying to desecrate the Temple:** See *study note on 21:28-29*.\n\n
24:10	idm145266					 Paul’s defense was that (1) he wasn’t in Jerusalem long enough to incite a riot; (2) none of his accusers had ever seen him stirring up a riot; and (3) he worshiped in accord with **Jewish law and everything written in the prophets**.\n\n
24:14	idm145273					 **the Way:** See *study note on 9:2*. • Paul emphasized his common ground with his Jewish audience, including his **worship***,* belief in **the Jewish law***,* acceptance of **the prophets***,* and hope in the resurrection (*24:14*, *15*; see *24:21*).\n\n
24:15	idm145290					 At the last judgment God **will raise both the righteous and the unrighteous**. Paul kept this final appointment with God constantly in mind (*24:16*). The fear of the “coming day of judgment” unnerved Felix in a subsequent conversation with Paul (*24:25*).\n\n
24:16	idm145299					 Paul stressed that he had acted with **a clear conscience** (see *20:27*, *33*; *23:1*; *1 Cor 4:4*; *2 Cor 1:12*; *4:2*; see also *2 Tim 1:3*). He had not departed from his Jewish heritage (*Acts 24:14*), and he had no fear of God’s judgment (*24:15*).\n\n
24:17	idm145315					 **money to aid my people:** See *study note on 20:1-2*; see also *Rom 15:25-29*; *1 Cor 16:1-2*; *2 Cor 9:1-7*. • **and to offer sacrifices to God:** See *Acts 21:23-26*.\n\n
24:22	idm145328					 Perhaps **Felix** delayed his decision hoping that Paul would bribe him (*24:26*).\n\n
24:23	idm145336					 It was in keeping with the proper treatment of a Roman citizen **to give him some freedom and allow his friends to visit him and take care of his needs**.\n\n
24:24	idm145343					 **Drusilla** was the sister of Herod Agrippa II and Bernice (*25:13*); Drusilla had abandoned her former husband, Azizus the King of Emessa, and married **Felix**. Drusilla **was Jewish***,* so in forsaking her original husband and marrying Felix she had disregarded God’s commands (*Exod 20:14*; *Deut 5:18*; cp. *Mal 2:16*; *Mark 10:12*). Josephus criticized her for this (*Antiquities* 20.7.1-2). Drusilla and her husband were confronted in their conversation with Paul by the prospect of judgment.\n\n
24:25	idm145359					 Paul’s words about **righteousness***,* **self-control***,* and coming divine **judgment** frightened **Felix***,* who was notably corrupt (*24:26-27*; see study notes on *23:24*; *24:24*).\n\n
24:26	idm145375					 Felix kept Paul in custody hoping for a **bribe**. When this failed and his own term ended, he left Paul in prison **to gain favor with the Jewish people**.\n\n
24:27	idm145383					 Felix’s successor was **Porcius Festus***,* appointed by Nero to be governor of Judea about AD 59~62. Josephus describes Festus as a conscientious, honest administrator who was not able to stem the rising tide of Jewish unrest despite his strong action against the party of the Assassins (Josephus, *Antiquities* 20.8.10; cp. *Acts 21:38*). He resisted the Jewish leaders’ attempt to have Paul’s trial moved to Jerusalem, but he was not immune to their pressure (*25:9*).\n\n
25:7	idm145395					 The **serious accusations** were probably those raised previously (*21:27-28*; *24:5-9*), but the accusations were unsupported by the evidence (*24:10-13*).\n\n
25:9	idm145405					 **Festus, wanting to please the Jews:** The governor would later state his official reason for delaying Paul’s trial and asking to move it to Jerusalem (*25:17-20*). His request was driven by politics, however, not justice.\n\n
25:10	idm145413					 Festus’s suggestion that Paul be tried in Jerusalem motivated the apostle’s **appeal to Caesar**. Paul was not afraid of death, but he objected to being turned over to a biased court intent on murder, not justice (*25:7*).\n\n
25:12	idm145421					 **Festus** granted Paul’s appeal. This fulfilled Paul’s conviction that he must see Rome (*19:21*; see also *23:11*; *27:24*; *Rom 1:13-15*; *15:22-29*).\n\n
25:13	idm145433					 Festus **discussed Paul’s case** with Herod Agrippa II (ruled AD 50–100), who had come to Caesarea to make a courtesy call on the new governor.\n\n
25:16	idm145441					 It was a fundamental principle: **Roman law** did **not convict people without a trial. They must be given an opportunity to confront their accusers and defend themselves** (cp. *19:38-39*). This put Roman judicial procedure in a favorable light for readers of Acts.\n\n
25:17	idm145450					 **I didn’t delay:** In contrast with Felix, his predecessor (*24:22-27*).\n\n
25:18	idm145458					 These verses give Festus’s official reasons for his actions; see also *25:9*. There were no criminal accusations against Paul; the objections were **about their religion** and centered on Paul’s claim that **Jesus** . . . **is alive**.\n\n
25:23	idm145468					 Paul’s hearing before **King Agrippa** was accompanied by all the pomp and circumstance appropriate for an official royal visit. The main purpose of the hearing was for Agrippa to advise Festus on what he should **write** in the appeal to Caesar, for there was **no clear charge against** Paul, and Festus himself believed Paul had **done nothing deserving death**.\n\n
26:1	idm145478					 In his eloquent **defense** before King **Agrippa***,* Paul argued that his preaching was completely consistent with the **Jewish** faith. The defense begins with a courteous acknowledgement of Agrippa’s competence to hear the evidence (*26:2-3*), outlines the nature of Paul’s background, Jewish training, and membership in the **Pharisees** (*26:4-5*), and explains that the charges against him are merely for believing the fulfillment of Jewish hopes for the resurrection (*26:6-8*). Paul then tells the story of his conversion from strong opponent of Christianity (*26:9-11*) through a vision on the way to **Damascus** (*26:12-18*; see *9:1-18*). His preaching was nothing more than obeying this divine **vision** (*26:19-20*). Even though he encountered violent opposition from his fellow Jews (*26:21*), God **protected** him as he taught a message that the Jews should have embraced (*26:22-23*). This defense is a model for Christians put on trial for their faith (see *9:15*; *Luke 21:12-15*).\n\n
26:12	idm145503					 See *9:1-18*.\n\n
26:17	idm145510					 Throughout his defense in this trial for his life, Paul also clearly set out the conditions for receiving new life in Christ (also in *26:20*, *23*; see *Matt 10:19-20*).\n\n
26:22	idm145519					 Paul stressed God’s protection as he carried out his witness (cp. *3:18*; *10:43*; *Luke 24:25-27*, *44-47*). Paul then called on his hearers to believe his message, that Jesus is the **Messiah** who fulfills the promises of the Old Testament (see *Luke 24:27*, *44*).\n\n
26:24	idm145532					 **Paul, you are insane:** Festus, a Roman, thought all this talk about the prophets and resurrection was **crazy** (cp. *17:18*, *32*), and he concluded that Paul must have driven himself mad with **too much study**.\n\n
26:26	idm145543					 **they were not done in a corner:** The major events of the Christian faith were historical matters of public record that witnesses could attest as factually true. Agrippa could not invalidate Paul’s statements of fact.\n\n
26:27	idm145550					 Paul’s question put **Agrippa** in a bind: If he said he believed **the prophets***,* he knew Paul would press home the Christian message; if not, he would offend the devout Jews in his audience. Agrippa knew that Paul wasn’t crazy and that Paul’s testimony about Jesus was historically sound (*26:26*). So Agrippa evaded Paul’s question and refused to face the claims of Christ, alleging that the statement given by Paul was too brief for him to arrive at a responsible decision.\n\n
26:28	idm145560					 **“Do you think you can persuade me to become a Christian so quickly?”:** This enigmatic remark might have been ironic, incredulous, scoffing, or brushing off Paul’s challenge. It also might have been a direct statement of Paul’s persuasiveness, or a direct statement about or genuine question of Paul’s intention. It seems best to take Agrippa’s reply as deliberately evasive: He didn’t want to admit that he believed the prophets (*26:27*), for Paul had just made a strong case, and the next step would be to believe in Jesus as the promised Messiah to whom the prophets pointed. Agrippa didn’t want to take that step. On the other hand, he didn’t want to say that he didn’t believe the prophets, for that would alienate the Jewish subjects to whose loyalties he wanted to appeal. His non-committal response underlines his discomfort with Paul’s testimony.\n\n
26:29	idm145568					 Paul’s bold answer shows his quickness in repartee. He challenges Agrippa and his whole audience about the value of knowing Christ and making a personal commitment to him.\n\n
26:31	idm145574					 The consensus of these rulers was that Paul had not **done anything to deserve death or imprisonment***;* this verdict was given repeatedly by the Roman authorities that considered Paul’s case (*25:25*; see *Luke 23:4*, *15*, *22*).\n\n
26:32	idm145586					 **He could have been set free:** The legal verdict was clear (*26:31*). But as a practical matter, **if he hadn’t appealed to Caesar***,* Paul might not have been alive (*25:1-11*). As it was, he was fulfilling God’s purposes for him (*23:11*).\n\n
27:1	idm145598					 The vivid nautical language used throughout the account of Paul’s journey to Rome yields one of the best available accounts of an ancient sea voyage. • This is the last “we” section in Acts (see also *16:10-17*; *20:5-15*; *21:1-18*). During the two years of Paul’s imprisonment, Luke had probably done much of the research for his Gospel throughout Judea and Galilee. Here, as a member of Paul’s sailing party, he was an eyewitness participant in the danger at sea.\n\n
27:1	idm145607					 **Julius** is otherwise unknown. • The **Imperial Regiment** (see *study note on 10:1-8*) served in Syria during this time.\n\n
27:2	idm145616					 **Aristarchus** was a native of **Thessalonica** and a co-worker with Paul in Asia (see *19:29*; *20:4*, *6*; *Phlm 1:24*). • **Adramyttium** was a port on the west coast of Asia Minor southeast of Troas.\n\n
27:3	idm145629					 **Sidon**, on the coast about 70 miles (110 km) north of Caesarea, was the first port of call. **Julius** treated Paul kindly and allowed his local Christian **friends** to care for him.\n\n
27:4	idm145638					 Luke describes in detail the sea voyage north and then west along the southern coast of Asia Minor. • **Myra** was a regular stop for **Egyptian** grain ships **bound for Italy**.\n\n
27:7	idm145647					 The **great difficulty** was due in part to the lateness of the season (*27:9*). • **Cnidus** was a seaport on the southwestern coast of Asia Minor near the island of Cos. • **The cape of Salmone** was located at the northeastern tip of **Crete***,* the largest of the Greek islands.\n\n
27:8	idm145659					 **Fair Havens** was a small bay on the southern side of the island of Crete.\n\n
27:9	idm145666					 **because it was so late in the fall:** This was a **dangerous** time for a voyage on the Mediterranean.\n\n
27:10	idm145674					 Paul realized what would happen if they went on. He warned the ship’s officers, but they and the Roman **officer** were unlikely to listen to an imprisoned Jewish rabbi with no experience as a seaman. Later, however, they would respect him more (*27:30-36*, *42-43*).\n\n
27:12	idm145683					 The prevailing southeasterly winds made Fair Havens an unsafe place for ships to harbor in the winter, but **Phoenix***,* a town **farther up the coast of Crete***,* offered a better **harbor**.\n\n
27:14	idm145694					 The storm, **called a “northeaster,”** was **of typhoon strength***,* very threatening to both the cargo and the crew. Forced to let the ship **run before the gale***,* they sailed past a small island called **Cauda** (known today as *Gaudos*), south of Crete.\n\n
27:17	idm145707					 Binding ropes around the ship’s hull (called *frapping* in nautical terms) was intended **to strengthen it** against the tremendous pressure of the storm. • **Syrtis** refers to the shallow bays filled with **sandbars** off the coast of North Africa west of Cyrene.\n\n
27:18	idm145717					 The violence and persistence of the storm led to **throwing the cargo overboard** (cp. *Jon 1:5*) and the crew’s abandoning **hope**.\n\n
27:21	idm145726					 Paul addressed the crew, first scolding them for not listening to him (*27:10-12*) and then encouraging them with the angel’s assurance of survival for all of them.\n\n
27:27	idm145733					 The **Sea of Adria***,* south of Italy and Greece and between Malta and Crete, is now known as the Ionian Sea.\n\n
27:30	idm145741					 This time the soldiers listened to Paul (cp. *27:10-11*).\n\n
27:33	idm145748					 Paul’s words and actions are those of a true leader who personally assesses a perilous situation, decides on action, and leads others in solving the problem (cp. *Neh 1–3*; contrast *Jon 1*). Paul’s positive example and strong faith in God (*Acts 27:22-25*) encouraged the others to eat and take heart.\n\n
27:36	idm145757					 The food brought renewed strength and encouragement to the frightened and exhausted crew and prisoners. • **all 276 of us:** The exact number of persons onboard fits well with what is known of grain ships of the period.\n\n
27:39	idm145764					 They ran **the ship aground** on **a shoal** or reef.\n\n
27:42	idm145772					 Even in a crisis, **the prisoners** remained the responsibility of **the soldiers** (see *12:19*; *16:27*; *27:32*; see *study note on 16:27*). Fortunately, **the commanding officer** intervened on their behalf. It was a clear indication of God’s protection and favor that all 276 people made it **safely to shore***,* precisely fulfilling the angel’s promise (see *27:24*).\n\n
28:1	idm145788					 **Malta** was a major island under Roman control, about sixty miles (100 km) south of Sicily.\n\n
28:3	idm145795					 The locals of Malta understood **justice** as a personified power or deity carrying out judgment on a criminal. When nothing bad happened to Paul, the natives understood him as having power over snakes and concluded that he himself was a god (cp. *14:11-12*). In fact, Paul’s survival demonstrated God’s protection (cp. *Mark 16:17-18*).\n\n
28:8	idm145804					 Cp. *Luke 4:38-40*.\n\n
28:10	idm145811					 Showing their gratefulness, the **people supplied** the ship’s company with what they needed.\n\n
28:11	idm145818					 Luke, himself present on this journey (see *study note on 27:1–28:16*), recorded Paul’s itinerary from Malta to **Rome** with great geographical detail.\n\n
28:11	idm145826					 Another Egyptian **ship** from Alexandria took Paul and his companions on board after an interval of **three months** and the worst of the winter had passed.\n\n
28:12	idm145834					 **Syracuse** was the capital of the eastern half of Sicily.\n\n
28:13	idm145841					 They sailed across the Straits of Messina to **Rhegium** on the southern tip of Italy. This port was a stopping place for ships traveling from the west coast of Italy to the eastern Mediterranean. • **Puteoli** (modern Pozzuoli) was a major port of entry for large grain ships bringing supplies from the east to Rome. Paul spent **a week** here with some local **believers** before moving on **to Rome**.\n\n
28:15	idm145852					 Paul was greeted by **brothers and sisters** who met his party on the way up to Rome.\n\n
28:16	idm145859					 Paul was allowed **to have his own** . . . **lodging***,* apparently in **private** facilities, **though he was guarded by a soldier**. Though Paul was traveling in chains, “the word of God cannot be chained” (*2 Tim 2:9*). Paul was possibly treated so well because of his social status or Roman citizenship (cp. *Acts 16:37-38*; *22:25-28*).\n\n
28:17	idm145873					 Conscious that the Good News was to be presented to the Jews first (*13:46*; *Rom 1:16*) and concerned that the false charges against him might already have reached Rome, Paul summoned **the local Jewish leaders** and gave an account of his life and work. He insisted that he was guilty of no criminal offense, but strong **Jewish** opposition had made it necessary for him **to appeal** to the emperor. Paul had nothing against his **own people***;* rather, he wanted to explain his great conviction that **the Messiah** they had been expecting had **already come** in the person of Jesus of Nazareth.\n\n
28:21	idm145888					 The Jewish leaders assured Paul that they had received no **reports against** him, and they wanted **to hear** his explanation of **this movement**.\n\n
28:23	idm145897					 Paul **explained** how **Jesus** fulfilled the Old Testament hopes for **the Kingdom of God***,* the master theme of Jesus’ own preaching (*Mark 1:14-15*; see *Matt 4:12-17*; *Luke 4:14-21*, *43*). Referring to **the Scriptures***,* Paul presented the case for Jesus as the promised Messiah.\n\n
28:24	idm145913					 Paul’s all-day message met a mixed response, as it had in other quarters (e.g., *13:40-51*; *17:11-14*).\n\n
28:25	idm145921					 Paul parted with scriptural words of warning that are often used in the New Testament to explain the Jewish rejection of the gospel (cp. *Matt 13:14-15*; *Mark 4:12*; *Luke 8:10*; *John 12:38-40*; see *Rom 11:1-12*, *25-32*).\n\n
28:28	idm145933					 Since Jews everywhere had been given an opportunity to accept the faith (*13:46*; see *Rom 1:16*), it was now time for **the Gentiles** to be offered **this salvation**.\n\n
28:31	idm145943					 Despite being under house arrest (*28:16*), Paul **boldly** proclaimed the Kingdom message. • **And no one tried to stop him** (Greek akōlutōs, “without hindrance”): This single word in Greek is the last word of the book of Acts and one of the keys to its meaning: God’s word cannot be chained, even when its messengers are (*2 Tim 2:9*; see *Phil 1:12-14*). Acts is the story of an unhindered message of Good News, available to all people throughout the world, whether Jew, Gentile, proselyte, rich, or poor. The mission of proclaiming this message is accomplished in the power of the Spirit (*Acts 1:8*); it embraces Jews (*3:1–5:42*), Samaritans (*8:1-25*), converts to Judaism (*2:11*; *13:43*), “God-fearers” (*8:26-40*; *9:32–11:18*), and Gentiles (*13:1–28:28*). • Luke ends his account with Paul still under house arrest in Rome (about AD 60–62). Paul was later released and traveled freely. According to tradition, Paul was imprisoned again in Rome about AD 64 and was martyred there during Nero’s persecution of believers.\n\n
