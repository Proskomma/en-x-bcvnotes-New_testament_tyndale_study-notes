1:1	idm47388					 The Chronicler begins by showing Israel’s place among the nations, tracing their line of descent from Adam to Jacob, using material from Genesis.\n\n
1:1	idm47394					 An overview of the generations between **Adam** and **the sons of Noah** (cp. *Gen 5:3-32*).\n\n
1:5	idm47403					 The record of Noah’s descendants establishes Abraham’s place in history. The ethnic backdrop of the seventy nations of the world provides the context for Israel’s history (cp. *Gen 10*).\n\n
1:13	idm47410					 **ancestor of the Hittites:** Hebrew *ancestor of Heth.*\n\n
1:24	idm47418					 The summary of **Shem**’s descendants ends with **Abraham** (cp. *Gen 11:10-26*).\n\n
1:28	idm47427					 Using the same pattern as the author of Genesis, the Chronicler traces separately the descendants of Abraham apart from Isaac, listing **the sons of Ishmael** (*1:29-31*; cp. *Gen 25:12-15*) and **the sons of Keturah** (*1 Chr 1:32-33*; cp. *Gen 25:1-3*) before detailing the descendants in the chosen family line.\n\n
1:34	idm47439					 Isaac’s genealogy first lists the descendants of **Esau** (*1:35-54*) and continues with **Israel.** The history of Edom is given in three components: **the sons of Esau** (*1:35-37*), **the descendants of Seir** (*1:38-42*), and **the kings who ruled in the land of Edom** (*1:43-54*). This arrangement follows *Gen 36*.\n\n
1:51	idm47455					 The Chronicler lists **the clan leaders of Edom** as far as his own sources allowed (see *Gen 36:40-43*).\n\n
2:3	idm47463					 While the genealogies present the entire people of Israel (*2:1-2*), David’s ancestors in the tribe of Judah receive priority.\n\n
2:3	idm47470					 The genealogy of Judah is as comprehensive as possible, recording peripheral material as the background to the main line of David’s ancestors. Cp. *Gen 46:12*.\n\n
2:3	idm47477					 **Er** and **Onan***,* the first two sons of Judah, were destroyed because of their sin (*Gen 38:6-10*). The descendants of **Shelah** are listed as an appendix at the end of the genealogies of Judah (*1 Chr 4:21-23*).\n\n
2:4	idm47489					 The main ancestral line of David descends from **Perez***,* one of the sons of **Tamar***,* Judah’s **widowed daughter-in-law**. • **Hamul**, one of Perez’s sons, is ignored completely; the Chronicler might not have had information about him.\n\n
2:6	idm47501					 For the genealogy of **Zerah,** cp. *Josh 7:1*, *17*; *1 Kgs 4:31* (Mahol might be another name for Zerah).\n\n
2:7	idm47511					 **set apart for the** Lord**:** See “*Complete Destruction*” Theme Note.\n\n
2:9	idm47521					 The descendants of Hezron are given down to the time of David, in several sections: the direct line from Hezron to David (*2:9-17*; cp. *Ruth 4:18-22*), the other descendants of Hezron (*1 Chr 2:18-41*), then the descendants of Hezron’s son Caleb (*2:42-55*).\n\n
2:9	idm47531					 **Caleb** was the most notable immediate descendant of **Hezron***,* so the author covers his descendants in detail (*2:42-55*). This *Caleb* was apparently not the same individual as Caleb son of Jephunneh, a descendant of Kenaz (see *study note on 4:13-15*).\n\n
2:10	idm47543					 The passage dedicated to the descendants of **Ram** provides a direct line of descent from Ram to **Jesse***,* then records Jesse’s children.\n\n
2:14	idm47552					 The Chronicler lists **David** as the **seventh** son of Jesse, while Samuel makes him the eighth (*1 Sam 16:6-13*; *17:12*). Samuel does not provide the names of David’s fourth, fifth, or sixth brothers (**Nethanel***,* **Raddai***,* and **Ozem**). Later, the Chronicler lists a brother named Elihu, who might or might not have been an additional son (see *study note on 1 Chr 27:18*). The number seven (the “perfect” number) perhaps symbolizes that David was chosen by God to rule.\n\n
2:20	idm47568					 The Lord chose **Bezalel***,* a craftsman descended from Hezron, to construct the Tabernacle (see *Exod 31:1-2*).\n\n
2:21	idm47577					 Some of the families of **Gilead***,* listed elsewhere as members of the tribe of Manasseh (cp. *Num 32:39-42*), also had a connection with the tribe of Judah.\n\n
2:24	idm47586					 **Tekoa** was a small Judean village southeast of Bethlehem (see also *4:5-8*).\n\n
3:1	idm47594					 The genealogy of **David** continues the genealogy of Ram (*2:10-17*), which included David as the seventh son of Jesse (*2:15*). David’s genealogy is divided into three sections: David’s sons (*3:1-9*); the kings of Judah down to **Jehoiachin** and **Zedekiah** (*3:10-16*), who were exiled to Babylon; and the descendants of Jehoiachin down to the time of the Chronicler (*3:17-24*).\n\n
3:1	idm47608					 The list of David’s sons relies on information from Samuel (*2 Sam 3:2-5*; *5:14-16*); the list is divided between **sons . . . born** while David ruled **in Hebron***,* and those **born . . . in Jerusalem.**\n\n
3:10	idm47620					 The Chronicler lists the kings of Judah in father-to-son progression from Solomon to the Exile.\n\n
3:15	idm47626					 Three of the four **sons of Josiah** served as kings of Judah.\n\n
3:16	idm47633					 **The successors of Jehoiakim were his son Jehoiachin and his brother Zedekiah:** At the very end of the monarchy of Judah, the sequence of kings did not follow the typical pattern of the eldest son succeeding his father.\n\n
3:17	idm47640					 This portion of the list of David’s descendants extends to around 400 BC.\n\n
3:21	idm47647					 **The sons of Hananiah . . . Shecaniah** (literally *The son of Hananiah [was] Pelatiah and Jeshaiah, the sons of Rephaiah, the sons of Arnan, the sons of Obadiah, the sons of Shecaniah*): In Hebrew, all the names are listed as “the sons” of Hananiah, all in one generation. However, many ancient manuscripts and translations support viewing the list as covering several generations (as in the NLT) by translating “sons of” (Hebrew *beney**,* four times) as “son of” (Hebrew *beno*). The resulting genealogy extends several generations from the time of Zerubbabel and his son **Hananiah**.\n\n
4:1	idm47659					 The genealogy of **Judah** continues, with links back to *2:1-55*. The connection to **Hur***,* the ancestor of Bethlehem, is provided immediately (*4:1-4*; see *2:19-20*, *51-55*).\n\n
4:9	idm47672					 The exact genealogies of the remaining descendants of Judah are unknown—the Chronicler apparently had incomplete information.\n\n
4:9	idm47678					 The section on **Jabez** stands independently, allowing the Chronicler to explain the origin of his name; he is not mentioned previously, although Jabez was listed as the name of a town inhabited by some of the descendants of Hur’s son Salma (*2:55*). **Jabez** apparently received his name because he caused his mother pain, a fulfillment of the curse on Eve (*Gen 3:16*). Although his name was a curse, he was **more honorable than any of his brothers***,* and his prayer changed the outcome of his life. The prayer is poetic; it consists of a plea for blessing followed by requests for prosperity and protection from harm. His last request might mean “keep me from causing trouble and pain.” God listened to his prayer and removed his curse.\n\n
4:13	idm47690					 The name **Kenaz** also appears as a descendant of Esau by Eliphaz (*Gen 36:11*); his descendants are known as the Kenizzites. The Kenizzites lived in the southern part of the land and had affiliations with Judah and Edom. **Caleb son of Jephunneh** was a Kenizzite (*Num 32:12*; *Josh 14:6*) and had a brother named Kenaz (*Josh 15:17*), whose family is listed here.\n\n
4:18	idm47702					 Through Mered’s wife **Bithia, a daughter of Pharaoh***,* the descendants of Judah included children of Egyptian heritage.\n\n
4:21	idm47710					 Now that Judah’s descendants through his wife Tamar have been recorded (*2:4–4:20*), **the descendants of Shelah***,* Judah’s third son through Bathshua, are listed (see *2:3*; *Gen 38:2*, *5*).\n\n
4:24	idm47722					 After completing the genealogy of Judah’s descendants (*2:3–4:23*), the Chronicler turns to the records for the rest of the sons of Israel (cp. *2:1-2*).\n\n
4:24	idm47730					 **Simeon** was Jacob’s second son; his tribe’s territory was in the southern part of Judah (*Josh 19:1-9*).\n\n
4:34	idm47738					 The list of men described as **leaders of Simeon’s wealthy clans** (*4:34-38*) introduces the description of Simeon’s geographic expansion (*4:38-43*). The tribe’s expansion involved thirteen family leaders during the days of Hezekiah (late 700s BC) in the area of Gerar. This might have been part of Hezekiah’s military action against Philistine territories (*2 Kgs 18:8*).\n\n
4:39	idm47749					 **Gerar:** The actual territory is not certain, since Gedor (as in Hebrew) is a common name; the Greek variant *Gerar* would refer to a city in Philistia, to the west of Judah (*Gen 10:19*).\n\n
4:41	idm47758					 **completely destroyed:** See “*Complete Destruction*” Theme Note.\n\n
5:1	idm47766					 Chapter 5 records the genealogies for **Reuben** (*5:1-10*; cp. *Gen 46:9*), **Gad** (*1 Chr 5:11-17*), and **Manasseh** (*5:23-24*), the tribes of Israel that settled in Transjordan (the area east of the Jordan River).\n\n
5:1	idm47779					 Although **Reuben** was the **oldest son of Israel,** he did not receive **his birthright** because he had sexual relations with his father’s concubine (*Gen 35:22*). Jacob transferred this right to Joseph when he elevated Ephraim and Manasseh to full membership among the tribes (*Gen 48:5*). This gave Joseph the double portion that traditionally belonged to the firstborn (*Deut 21:15-17*). As Jacob foresaw, Judah surpassed his brothers and became the forefather of the ruling tribe (*Gen 49:8-10*). However, Reuben is still listed first (*1 Chr 2:1*).\n\n
5:3	idm47793					 **The sons of Reuben** are also listed in *Gen 46:9*; *Exod 6:14*; *Num 26:5-6*.\n\n
5:4	idm47803					 The exact relationship between **the descendants of Joel** and the rest of the tribe of Reuben is unknown.\n\n
5:6	idm47810					 **Tiglath-pileser** was king of Assyria (744–727 BC); he attacked the tribes of Transjordan during King Pekah’s reign (752–732 BC), taking the people **into captivity** (see *5:25-26*; *2 Kgs 15:29*).\n\n
5:10	idm47822					 The tribes of Transjordan, including the **Reubenites***,* expanded their settlements to the north and east in conjunction with their war with the **Hagrites** in the days of Saul (see *5:18-22*; *Ps 83:6*). Later, the Hagrites were among David’s men (see *1 Chr 11:38*; *27:31*).\n\n
5:18	idm47835					 The account of the **war against the Hagrites** develops the elements introduced in *5:10*. It was a struggle among shepherds over grazing territory. All three tribes were participants; the Chronicler details their prowess, military qualifications, and numbers. With **God . . . fighting against** the enemy, the victory resulted in enormous spoils and total possession of the territory.\n\n
5:25	idm47844					 The tribes of **Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh** went into permanent exile because of unfaithfulness.\n\n
6:1	idm47851					 By its substantial scope and placement in the center of the genealogical lists, this section gives special significance to the priestly tribe of **Levi**.\n\n
6:1	idm47858					 This section provides the genealogies of the three most significant groups of the tribe of Levi: the high priests (*6:1-15*), the three clans of Levites (*6:16-30*), and the singers (*6:31-47*). Each genealogy begins with an introduction, followed by the list of names.\n\n
6:1	idm47867					 The three **sons of Levi** are introduced, but their actual genealogies are postponed to follow the list of high priests.\n\n
6:2	idm47874					 After the Exile, the community of Judea, for whom Chronicles was written, needed to establish unequivocally the legitimate ancestry of the priests. This genealogy of **Kohath** established continuity between the ancestors known from the Pentateuch and the later high priests down to the exile of Judah in 586 BC; other records connected the priests following the Exile with this line (see *Ezra 3:2*; *7:1-6*; *Hag 1:1*). Not all who served as high priest were included in this listing.\n\n
6:10	idm47885					 Most Old Testament scholars agree that the phrase **the high priest at the Temple built by Solomon in Jerusalem** belongs in *6:9* (connected to the first **Azariah**) but that the order was transposed through a scribal error. Making this correction yields 12 generations between Aaron and the building of the Temple, which conforms to the date in *1 Kgs 6:1* (480 years is the equivalent of 12 generations of 40 years each in numerical typology). The correction also results in 12 generations between the building of the Temple under Azariah to the rebuilding of the Temple under Jeshua (*Ezra 3:2*).\n\n
6:16	idm47896					 The second introduction of the Levites (*6:16-19a*) introduces the heads of all the Levitical families (*6:19b-30*). The list contains the genealogies of **Gershon** (*6:20-21*), **Kohath** (*6:22-24*), **and Merari** (*6:29-30*).\n\n
6:27	idm47910					 When he served under Eli, **Samuel** assumed a Levitical function (*1 Sam 3:1*).\n\n
6:31	idm47918					 This genealogy names the lead singers from **Kohath** (*6:33*), **Gershon** (*6:39*), and **Merari** (*6:44*), the chief Levitical families.\n\n
6:33	idm47930					 **Heman** held the lead position among David’s singers (see *Ps 88:title*).\n\n
6:39	idm47939					 **Asaph** wrote several psalms (*Pss 50*; *73–83*).\n\n
6:49	idm47948					 This explanation of the priests’ prerogatives introduces the list that follows.\n\n
6:50	idm47954					 The list of priests from **Aaron** to **Ahimaaz** provides an introduction to the territorial list (*6:54-81*). The list runs down to David’s time, when Ahimaaz served (*2 Sam 15:36*; *17:17-29*; *18:19-29*).\n\n
6:54	idm47966					 The list of Levitical cities is derived from *Josh 21*, following a geographical logic, with families grouped in defined geographical districts. To show the unity and completeness of Israel, the territorial list presents the Levites as settled in the land to the same extent as the other tribes.\n\n
7:1	idm47973					 In this chapter, the genealogies of the remaining tribes of Israel are given. • The sections on the tribes of **Issachar***,* **Benjamin***,* and **Asher** might have been derived from a military census; the lists are of nearly equal length, emphasize military terminology, record the father’s houses, and provide no information on settlements. • The tribes of Zebulun and Dan are omitted entirely, and **Naphtali** has a very brief record.\n\n
7:12	idm47985					 The Hebrew text of this verse appears to have been disrupted (something was apparently lost during scribal copying) because no introduction is given for either **Ir** or **Hushim**. The names **Shuppim and Huppim** have parallels in the tribe of Benjamin (*8:8*, *11*; *Gen 46:21*; *Num 26:39*). If the Hebrew text was in fact damaged, **Hushim** might be a descendant of Dan (cp. *Gen 46:23*; *Num 26:42*).\n\n
7:13	idm48001					 In contrast with other genealogies, this abrupt listing of **the sons of Naphtali** includes only the first generation (cp. *Gen 46:24*; *Num 26:48-50*). The manuscript of Chronicles might have suffered damage at an early stage of scribal copying, which could also account for the omission of Dan and Zebulun. It is also possible that the records for Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali were lost when Tiglath-pileser attacked and exiled these tribes during Pekah’s reign (*2 Kgs 15:29*); in that case, the Chronicler had no records available to include.\n\n
7:14	idm48011					 Several difficulties in these verses might indicate that the Hebrew text was damaged: (1) **Maacah** is listed as the sister of **Makir** as well as his wife (*7:15-16*). (2) **Huppim and Shuppim** were listed earlier with Benjamin (*7:12*), not **Manasseh.** (3) Those **considered Gileadites** (*7:16-17*) are rather ambiguously linked to **Gilead***,* whose direct descendants are not listed (cp. *Num 26:30-33*). (4) **The sons of Shemida** are not connected to the genealogy (*1 Chr 7:19*); Shemida was one of Gilead’s descendants (*Num 26:32*).\n\n
7:20	idm48031					 The genealogy of **the descendants of Ephraim** includes a story illustrating the circumstances of the tribe’s settlement in Canaan (*7:21-24*). The genealogy ends with **Joshua** son of **Nun***,* who led Israel into the Promised Land.\n\n
7:22	idm48042					 The **father** of Ezer and Elead is recorded as **Ephraim***,* but Ephraim the son of Joseph could not have settled in Canaan after the Exodus. The traditional solution was to imagine an early exodus for the family of Ephraim. Other possibilities are that the name *Ephraim* is a scribal mistake or that *Ephraim* referred to the tribe rather than the son of Joseph who bore the name.\n\n
8:1	idm48053					 The genealogy of **Benjamin’s** descendants brings the genealogies to a close. The record began with Judah, the tribe of David; it ends with Benjamin, the tribe of Saul.\n\n
8:3	idm48060					 **Gera, Abihud:** As translated, Bela had two sons named *Gera* (*8:3*, *5*), an unusual situation. If the rendering suggested in the NLT note is correct, the second Gera was the first Gera’s son.\n\n
8:6	idm48070					 This list reports the militia from the clans of **Ehud** (*8:6-7*) and **Shaharaim** (*8:8-28*), who lived in the vicinity of Jerusalem.\n\n
8:7	idm48080					 This **exile** is unknown; it might have been a voluntary emigration from the territory of Benjamin, perhaps during the period of the judges.\n\n
8:29	idm48087					 This list gives the militia that resided at **Gibeon***,* although some of them had moved to **Jerusalem**.\n\n
8:33	idm48096					 The Chronicler concludes his record of Benjamin’s history with the genealogy of **Saul***,* beginning two generations before Saul and extending through **Merib-baal** (=Mephibosheth; see *study note on 2 Sam 4:4*) and down to the families of **Azel** and **Eshek** (*1 Chr 8:38-40*). **Micah** (*8:35*) lived in the time of Solomon, and **Ulam** (*8:39*) lived near the end of the kingdom of Judah before the destruction of Jerusalem. Thus, Saul is connected with his larger tribal history and with a noble heritage that carried on throughout the kingdom period.\n\n
9:1	idm48113					 The Chronicler shows how people and institutions who returned from the Exile had continuity with the past. The Levites and the priests are prominent in this summary of Israel, expressing the Chronicler’s view that they were central to the organization of the nation. They were crucial to Israel’s function and success as a nation where God was the King. The Chronicler drew upon the records of ancient times as far back as Moses and David (*9:19-22*) to describe each group’s homeland and rank.\n\n
9:1	idm48120					 The statement that **all Israel was listed in the genealogical records** reveals the crux of the Chronicler’s thought, that *all Israel* was represented by the community of Judea in the time of the Chronicler, which had continuity with Israel’s past. • **The Book of the Kings of Israel** is a source document that the authors of both Kings and Chronicles used but has now been lost (see also *study note on 1 Kgs 14:19-20*). • **The people of Judah were exiled** for unfaithfulness, as the other tribes had been (*1 Chr 5:25-26*; *6:15*; see *2 Chr 36:20-21*).\n\n
9:3	idm48134					 **settled in Jerusalem:** Jerusalem had always been at the center of all Israel, and people from all the tribes lived there, both before and after the Exile. This statement affirms the inclusion of some members of the northern tribes among those who returned from exile.\n\n
9:21	idm48141					 **Tabernacle:** See *study note on Exod 27:21*.\n\n
9:28	idm48149					 **various articles used in worship:** See *Exod 25:8–30:38*.\n\n
9:30	idm48157					 The **priests . . . blended the spices** for use in the Tabernacle and Temple, and that blend could not be used for secular purposes (*Exod 30:34-38*).\n\n
9:32	idm48165					 **bread to be set on the table each Sabbath day:** See *Exod 25:23-30*.\n\n
9:34	idm48173					 The reference to **Jerusalem** draws readers back to the beginning (*9:3*) and defines all Israel in terms of its representatives living in that city. • In detailing the responsibilities of the priests and Levites, the Chronicler’s primary focus was the **heads of Levite families** (*9:10-33*).\n\n
9:35	idm48183					 The place of Saul’s family in the kingdom has already been established (*8:29-40*); the repetition of that material provides a transition from the genealogies to the narratives, beginning with the story of Saul’s death (ch *10*).\n\n
10:1	idm48191					 The narrative of Israel as a kingdom begins with the death of Saul, who failed to fulfill God’s purposes for him as king and for Israel as a nation. Saul’s death prepares the way for David, whom the Chronicler regarded as the first true king of Israel.\n\n
10:6	idm48197					 **Saul and his three sons died . . . bringing his dynasty to an end:** The Chronicler does not mention Saul’s armor bearer or the rest of his troops (see *1 Sam 31:6*), emphasizing God’s action in removing Saul and replacing him with David (*1 Chr 10:14*).\n\n
11:1	idm48206					 **David** first became king of Judah at **Hebron** and ruled there 7½ years (*3:4*; *2 Sam 5:5*). The Chronicler omits the account of that period (see *2 Sam 2–4*) and focuses on David’s reign over the entire nation for 33½ years, beginning with his **covenant . . . with all the elders of Israel** at Hebron (see *2 Sam 5:1-5*).\n\n
11:4	idm48219					 David’s conquest and rebuilding of **Jerusalem** established it as the capital city of his reign over all Israel.\n\n
11:10	idm48226					 This account of **David’s mighty warriors** demonstrates that David had the support of Israel’s best and bravest men, as well as the support of **all Israel** (cp. *2 Sam 23:8-39*).\n\n
11:10	idm48235					 **just as the** Lord** had promised:** David’s kingship was God’s choice, not David’s or the people’s (cp. *11:3*; *1 Sam 16:11-14*).\n\n
11:41	idm48246					 **Zabad . . . Jaasiel:** These warriors, not mentioned in the parallel passage at *2 Sam 23*, were from locations east of the Jordan River. David had broad support among all the tribes of Israel as well as among foreigners.\n\n
12:1	idm48254					 Support for making **David** king did not begin with Saul’s demise. When Saul was king and David was a fugitive, **warriors** went to David and eventually became a vast camp of various tribes, representing all of Israel. Even **relatives of Saul** deserted to David and supported him as king (*12:2*). Of course, David was prudent about such deserters (*12:17*), making sure they were not traitors who would betray him to Saul. Before David’s actual anointing took place at Hebron, the will of the people reflected the will of God that David should become king.\n\n
12:23	idm48265					 The succession of a king was often a contentious matter, particularly when the new king represented a different family lineage. The gathering of all twelve tribes at Hebron, including some of **Saul’s relatives** (*12:29*), to confirm David’s rule showed that the animosity of the war among different tribes following Saul’s death had been overcome (*12:23-37*). The Chronicler stresses the unity among the tribes with the declaration that they all, without reservation, had **the single purpose of making David the king over all Israel** (*12:38*).\n\n
13:1	idm48276					 These chapters chronicle the transformation of Jerusalem into the political and religious center of Israel, beginning with David’s disastrous attempt to transfer **the Ark of God from Kiriath-jearim** to Jerusalem (*13:1-14*; cp. *2 Sam 6:2-11*).\n\n
13:9	idm48285					 With the death of **Uzzah***,* Israel’s celebration abruptly turned to sorrow. Touching the Ark resulted in death because its holiness had been violated (see *15:13*).\n\n
13:12	idm48294					 David’s response to Uzzah’s death might have been an expression of his own inadequacy to bring the Ark to Jerusalem.\n\n
14:1	idm48300					 Even though the Ark was not present in Jerusalem (*13:1-14*), God blessed David’s palace, his children, and his conquest of the Philistines. God’s blessing did not depend on the presence of the Ark. These blessings eventually encouraged David to carry out his original plan to bring the Ark into Jerusalem (*15:1-29*).\n\n
14:1	idm48308					 Hiram’s generosity provided further evidence of God’s purpose in making David king.\n\n
14:8	idm48314					 News of David’s rule **over all Israel** catalyzed **the Philistines** to attack; they could no longer regard him as subordinate to their patronage, as they had when he ruled only Judah. They attacked through the valley southwest of Jerusalem (see *Josh 15:8*). David inquired of the Lord before battle, a direct contrast to Saul’s inquiring of a medium in seeking help against the Philistines (*1 Chr 10:13*; see *1 Sam 28*).\n\n
14:12	idm48325					 David’s **orders to burn** the Philistine idols conformed to God’s instructions (*Deut 7:5*).\n\n
15:1	idm48333					 Again, David set out to bring **the Ark of God** to Jerusalem. This time he made thorough preparations to ensure that the transfer would succeed.\n\n
15:1	idm48340					 The first attempt to bring **the Ark** to Jerusalem (*13:1-14*) failed because of improper procedure (see *15:13*). This time, David prepared a place for the Ark in Jerusalem and organized **Levites . . . to carry the Ark** because this was their responsibility (*Deut 10:8*; *18:5*). The **special tent** that David prepared for the Ark was not the Tabernacle, which was located at Gibeon at the time (see *1 Chr 16:39*; *21:29*).\n\n
15:13	idm48355					 See *13:1-10*.\n\n
15:16	idm48362					 This is the first of three lists of Levitical musicians (see *15:19-22*; *16:4-6*). This list gave the names of the three leaders (**Heman***,* **Asaph***,* and **Ethan***;* see *6:33-47*) along with **their assistants**.\n\n
15:19	idm48378					 The second list of Levitical musicians focused on their musical specialties rather than their rank.\n\n
15:20	idm48384					 **harps:** Hebrew adds *according to Alamoth.* *Alamoth* is probably a melody, believed to be sung in the soprano range (related to Hebrew ‘*almah**,* “young woman”).\n\n
15:21	idm48395					 **lyres:** Hebrew adds *according to the Sheminith.* *Sheminith* might be related to a term meaning “octave,” suggesting a lower vocal range.\n\n
15:29	idm48404					 The **contempt** of **Michal** (cp. *2 Sam 6:16-23*) toward David stands in stark contrast to God’s blessing on the celebration (*1 Chr 15:26*); her description as **the daughter of Saul** implies that her attitude mirrored her father’s disregard for the Lord (see *1 Sam 10:10-12*; *13:7-14*; *15:10-23*; *28:1-25*).\n\n
16:1	idm48419					 The transfer of the Ark (*16:1-3*) and the conclusion of the event (*16:43*) are reported exactly as in Samuel (see *2 Sam 6:17-20*). However, between these bookends, the Chronicler elaborates on the celebrations that accompanied the event and on the permanent arrangements for worship (*1 Chr 16:4-42*). David’s psalm of celebration is the central focus of the account.\n\n
16:7	idm48429					 David’s **song of thanksgiving** is a composite of three psalms: *16:8-22* draws from *Ps 105:1-15*; *1 Chr 16:23-33* draws from *Ps 96*; and *1 Chr 16:34-38* draws from *Ps 106:1*, *47-48*. The composer made several adjustments to the sources to fit this occasion. The Temple did not exist when the Ark was brought to Jerusalem, so the Chronicler says that **strength and joy fill his dwelling** (*1 Chr 16:27*) instead of “his sanctuary” (*Ps 96:6*) and requires the worshiper to **come into his presence** (*1 Chr 16:29*) instead of “into his courts” (*Ps 96:8*). The name “Abraham” (*Ps 105:9*) is also changed to **Israel** (*1 Chr 16:13*) to focus specifically on the nation as the fulfillment of the promises to Abraham. The hymn does not mention the judgment of the earth (*Ps 96:10*, *13*; cp. *1 Chr 16:30*, *33*) because it was not relevant to the dedication of the Ark.\n\n
16:39	idm48456					 **Gibeon** served as the central **place of worship** until the Temple was built in Jerusalem (see *21:29*; *2 Chr 1:3*). The personnel **at the Tabernacle** had to be reorganized because some of the Levites were permanently transferred to Jerusalem.\n\n
17:1	idm48467					 The larger section (*13:1–17:27*) concludes with Nathan’s prophecy about David and David’s prayer of thanks.\n\n
17:1	idm48474					 David wanted to build a home for **the Ark** that would equal his own **palace***,* but the Lord designated David’s heir, Solomon (ch *22*), to build the Temple. Jerusalem was to be the single place of worship for all Israel.\n\n
17:10	idm48484					 David had resolved to build a house for the Lord—the Temple. Instead, the Lord would **build a house** for David—**a dynasty of kings**. Establishing David’s eternal *dynasty* was the central part of God’s plan to establish his rule on earth.\n\n
17:12	idm48493					 The construction of the Temple was a central aspect of God’s kingdom on earth. Solomon later built the Temple (*2 Chr 2–7*) and fulfilled this promise.\n\n
17:13	idm48500					 The Chronicler made this declaration about Solomon in particular (see *22:9*; *28:5-6*; cp. *2 Sam 7:14*).\n\n
17:14	idm48509					 In the parallel at *2 Sam 7:16*, God promises to establish David’s house, kingdom, and throne, whereas here it is Solomon’s. While the books of Samuel and Kings cast David as Israel’s ideal king, the Chronicler views Solomon as David’s equal. David made all the preparations for building the Temple, but God designated Solomon as the Temple builder. The promise to Israel was secured in the combined reigns of David and Solomon.\n\n
18:1	idm48516					 This section recounts David’s wars and military achievements, presenting David as the great warrior of Israel’s history. This account relates the public and political aspects of David’s enemies, but it deals very little with their private affairs. • Three distinct sections reflect accounts in Samuel: (1) the battles in the expansion of the kingdom (*18:1-17*; see *2 Sam 8:1-16*); (2) the battle against the Ammonites (*1 Chr 19:1–20:3*; see *2 Sam 10:1–11:1*; *12:30-31*); and (3) the exploits of David’s mighty men (*1 Chr 20:4-8*; see *2 Sam 21:18-22*). Each section begins with a chronological transition (**after this**) that loosely joins these events (*1 Chr 18:1*; *19:1*; *20:4*).\n\n
18:1	idm48533					 These war records tell the story of David’s expanding kingdom in conquering **the Philistines** (*18:1*), **Moab** (*18:2*), **Zobah** (*18:3-4*), **Damascus** (*18:5-6*), and **Edom** (*18:12-13*); these include records of David’s international relations, spoils, and tribute (*18:7-11*). A recurring theme is that **the** Lord** made David victorious wherever he went** (*18:6*, *13*).\n\n
18:1	idm48555					 The **Philistines** posed a constant threat to David’s kingdom (see study notes on *Josh 13:2*; *19:43*; *Judg 3:3*). They remained entrenched in their coastal settlements; although David conquered **Gath and its surrounding towns***,* a Philistine king remained in Gath at the end of David’s reign (*1 Kgs 2:39*).\n\n
18:2	idm48568					 David’s conquests east of the Jordan River took place in stages. The conquest of **Moab** in the south gave David firm control over the plateau north of the Arnon River. David’s victory over the Aramean alliance under **Hadadezer** brought him into alliance with **King Toi of Hamath***,* an archenemy of Hadadezer (*18:9-11*). With the defeat of Ammon and the Arameans east of the Jordan, David extended his control over the southern expanses of **Edom** and gained access to a southern seaport (*18:12-13*).\n\n
18:14	idm48581					 The listing of David’s officials demonstrates the greatness of his rule over all of Israel.\n\n
19:1	idm48587					 The new Ammonite ruler, **Hanun***,* took exception to Israel’s presence so close to his nation. The Ammonites hired Aramean armies from the north, and these combined forces assembled **at Medeba** to challenge David’s control of Moab’s plateau.\n\n
19:9	idm48596					 The enemy armies drew their battle lines strategically; **the Ammonites** positioned themselves so that the city of Medeba could serve as a refuge, while the Israelites also had to deal with a second offensive from **the Arameans**. **Joab** divided his forces to fight on both fronts from a central rallying point.\n\n
19:13	idm48605					 Joab knew that the battle was not being waged to gain more territory but to defend the **people and the cities** of Israel from invasion (cp. *19:8*). • Joab placed his trust in God, knowing that the outcome depended on the Lord’s providence.\n\n
19:16	idm48613					 In the battle against **the Arameans***,* David accomplished three objectives: He challenged **Hadadezer’s** supremacy, threw the alliance of the Arameans into disarray, and prevented any possible future alliance between **the Arameans** and **the Ammonites**.\n\n
20:1	idm48624					 This war against the Ammonites was the context of David’s sin with Bathsheba (*2 Sam 11:2–12:25*), which the Chronicler omits.\n\n
21:1	idm48631					 This account of the **census** closely parallels *2 Sam 24:1-25* but has an entirely different focus. The Chronicler’s account provides the context for the dedication of the altar and the preparations for building the Temple (*1 Chr 22*).\n\n
21:1	idm48640					 **Satan** (or *the adversary*) motivated **David to take a census** of his military forces (cp. *2 Sam 24:1*). The Chronicler seems to interpret the narrative of Samuel in light of his theology of Satan as the adversary of God and humanity. As God allows Satan to work in the world, Satan unwittingly fulfills God’s purposes (cp. *2 Chr 18:3-34*; *Job 1:6–2:7*; *Zech 3:1-2*; *Matt 4:1-11*; *John 13:27*; *1 Cor 5:5*; *2 Cor 12:7*; *1 Tim 1:20*; *Rev 20:3*, *7-9*).\n\n
21:7	idm48660					 The *study note on 2 Sam 24:1* discusses possible reasons why **God was very displeased with the census.**\n\n
21:9	idm48668					 **Gad** is later mentioned as having compiled a list of “the events of King David’s reign” (*29:29*).\n\n
21:16	idm48676					 These verses provide a more detailed description of the angel and of David’s response than the parallel text (*2 Sam 24:17*). The sight of the angel carrying out his mission inspired David to plead on behalf of the people.\n\n
21:26	idm48683					 The census and plague led up to the dedication of **Araunah’s threshing floor** as the site for the new sanctuary. Typically, **offerings** would have been made at **Gibeon***,* where **the Tabernacle** was located (see *16:39*; *21:29*; *2 Chr 1:3*). The halting of the plague at the *threshing floor* enabled **David** to make offerings there in accordance with the word he received through Gad the seer (*1 Chr 21:18*). David then designated the new location for the future **Temple of the** Lord** God**.\n\n
22:2	idm48703					 God had promised David that his kingdom would be permanent and that his son would build a temple for the Lord (*17:11-12*). Now that the site had been chosen (*21:18–22:1*), David made preparations for **building the Temple of God.** He gathered the materials (*22:2-5*), and he charged both **Solomon** (*22:6-16*) and **the leaders of Israel** (*22:17-19*) with the task of building the Temple after his death.\n\n
22:5	idm48717					 While Solomon was **young and inexperienced** (see also *29:1*; cp. *1 Kgs 3:7*; *2 Chr 13:7*), David had the wisdom and skill to make **preparations** for building **the Temple***;* David also designed the Temple (*1 Chr 28:11-12*). Later, God provided Solomon with the wisdom he needed to build the Temple and to govern well (see *2 Chr 1:7-12*).\n\n
22:8	idm48732					 God did not allow David to build the Temple because he had **shed so much blood** (cp. *1 Kgs 5:3-4*). David’s wars were not unethical, and God had blessed and supported them. However, David had been tainted with a kind of ceremonial uncleanness from the blood he had shed and the deaths he had caused in battle (see *1 Chr 28:3*; cp. *Gen 4:10-12*; *Lev 17:3-4*; *Deut 21:1-9*; *Matt 27:24-25*). Accordingly, he could not build a holy sanctuary for the Lord.\n\n
22:9	idm48745					 **Solomon** was a **man of peace,** free from war and from shedding blood in battle. The **Temple** was built during his peaceful reign (see *2 Chr 2–7*). • The Hebrew deliberately uses two different words to describe conditions during Solomon’s reign: **peace** (Hebrew *shalom,* related to Solomon’s name), **and quiet** (Hebrew *menukhah**,* related to the idea of redemption).\n\n
23:1	idm48760					 When **David . . . appointed his son Solomon** as Israel’s king (cp. *1 Kgs 1*), David outlined the organizational structure of the kingdom and made all the necessary provisions for the Temple’s functioning. • The account of Solomon’s coronation continues in *1 Chr 28–29*; the intervening chapters (*23:3–27:24*) record in detail the organization of the kingdom.\n\n
23:3	idm48770					 **The Levites** are recorded according to their roles rather than their families.\n\n
23:6	idm48777					 **David divided the Levites into divisions** according to their ancestral families. The number of available clerics far exceeded the requirements for a single Temple; the divisions provided a necessary time-sharing mechanism that enabled all the priests and Levites to serve in the Temple periodically (cp. *Luke 1:5*, *8*).\n\n
23:24	idm48786					 In the census of *23:3*, individuals were counted at age thirty, but the actual registration of the divisions included those **twenty years old or older** (cp. *Num 1:3*). The age of entry into Levitical service apparently varied over time according to need.\n\n
23:28	idm48795					 **The work of the Levites was to assist the priests***,* which they accomplished in various ways: maintaining the Temple, setting out the **sacred bread** and other offerings, singing, and helping the priests with the sacrifices. These duties were allotted to different family divisions of Levites (*23:4-6*).\n\n
24:1	idm48805					 The information about the priests’ duties includes only their organization into orders and the assignment of their responsibilities by casting lots. The Chronicler does not explain their duties because they had long been solidly established (see *Exod 28:1-5*; *Lev 1–7*; *Num 6:22-27*).\n\n
24:1	idm48814					 The organization of **the priests** into their divisions **for service** began with Aaron’s sons **Eleazar and Ithamar***;* all of Israel’s priests were descended from these two men.\n\n
24:3	idm48824					 **Zadok** and **Ahimelech** were the leaders of the two families of priests during David’s time (see *6:8*; *18:16*; *2 Sam 8:17*).\n\n
24:7	idm48835					 The twenty-four divisions established for the priests continued unchanged for many generations; the order of **Abijah** (*24:10*) is specifically mentioned in *Luke 1:5*, *8*.\n\n
24:20	idm48845					 **The other family leaders** might refer to all those members of the tribe who were not priests yet who had already been documented (see *23:6-23*), or it might refer to Levites not mentioned before. However, most of the families were already included in the previous list. Therefore, this list appears to be an independent, supplementary list that complements the previous register of Levites, perhaps bringing the earlier list up to date at a later time.\n\n
24:31	idm48853					 The Levites were organized according to the same principles as the priests (*24:5-6*).\n\n
25:1	idm48860					 The musicians who served at the time of King **David** are listed according to their membership in **the families of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun**.\n\n
25:1	idm48868					 **Asaph:** See *6:39-40*; *15:17-19*; *16:5*; *2 Chr 29:30*; *Ezra 2:40-41*; *Pss 50*; *73*–-83.• **Heman:** See *1 Chr 6:33-38*; *Ps 88*. • **Jeduthun:** See *1 Chr 16:41-42*; *2 Chr 5:12*; *35:15*; *Pss 39*, *62*, *77*.\n\n
25:2	idm48892					 **Asaph** and **Jeduthun** . . . **proclaimed God’s messages***,* meaning they were prophets as well as musicians.\n\n
25:8	idm48902					 As with the priests, the order of the musicians by families was decided by **sacred lots** so that no preference would be shown (see *24:5*, *31*).\n\n
26:1	idm48911					 The first ancestor of the **gatekeepers** was **Meshelemiah** (called “Shallum” in *Ezra 2:42*; “Meshullam” in *Neh 12:25*).\n\n
26:5	idm48921					 **God had richly blessed Obed-edom***,* who temporarily housed the Ark (*13:13-14*), by giving him many descendants (*26:8*).\n\n
26:20	idm48931					 In preparation for Solomon’s succession to the throne, David appointed these officials as part of his comprehensive organization of the Levitical orders at the end of his reign. The officers included treasurers, administrators, and judges who were part of the political bureaucracy.\n\n
26:21	idm48937					 The Levites were in charge of the Lord’s treasuries and property (see *2 Chr 24:11*; *31:12*). Some spoils of war were always dedicated to God (*1 Chr 26:26-28*).\n\n
26:31	idm48946					 **Jazer** was a Levitical city (*Josh 21:39*) that became an administrative center during the monarchy. David and his descendants could depend on the loyalty of the Levites from **Hebron** (*1 Sam 30:27-31*; *2 Sam 2:1-11*).\n\n
27:1	idm48957					 David’s reserve **army** was organized into twelve **divisions***,* each serving on active duty one **month** each year. Their duties probably included protecting the borders, policing, keeping order in conquered territories, manning fortresses, and tending military equipment (horses and chariots). The divisions were not related to Israel’s tribal structure; each division contained individuals from various tribes, indicating the integration of the kingdom.\n\n
27:16	idm48967					 The order of the tribes roughly follows *Num 1:5-15*: the six sons of Leah, the two sons of Rachel (the “tribe” of Joseph=**Ephraim** and **Manasseh**, followed by **Benjamin**), followed by the two sons of Bilhah (**Dan** and **Naphtali**). Changes from the order of that list are that **Naphtali** is transferred to his geographical location next to **Zebulun***,* and the tribe of **Levi** is inserted at the position of Levi’s birth order, with the family of **Aaron (the priests)** listed separately. Absent from this list are the two sons of Zilpah (Gad and Asher).\n\n
27:18	idm48984					 The name **Elihu** might refer to *Eliab* (*2:13*), or he might have been a different **brother of David**.\n\n
27:25	idm48994					 Ancient kings, including David, acquired large amounts of property for themselves. This list records various aspects of David’s estate, including storehouses in Jerusalem and the provinces, property used for agricultural purposes, and various types of livestock.\n\n
27:32	idm49000					 The register of David’s officials concludes with this list of influential persons in the king’s immediate entourage. • A **wise counselor to the king** was probably an intimate confidant.\n\n
28:1	idm49007					 Here the account of Solomon’s coronation continues from *23:1-2*. David is presented at the pinnacle of his strength as he transfers authority to Solomon (cp. *1 Kgs 1:1–2:9*).\n\n
28:1	idm49015					 This assembly of **all the officials of Israel** includes all whose names were mentioned in the preceding chapters.\n\n
28:2	idm49022					 The account of David’s first discourse includes a message addressed to his people (*28:2-8*) and a message to Solomon (*28:9-10*). The main focus of the address is David’s desire for Solomon to **build a Temple**. In addition, David addressed two other important themes: God’s selection of Solomon, and the people’s obligation to keep God’s commandments.\n\n
28:2	idm49031					 David described the Temple as a place where the **Ark of the** Lord**’s Covenant . . . could rest.** The term “rest” describes the conquest of the land and the establishment of peace (e.g., *Deut 12:9*). In the wilderness, the Ark rested at the end of battle (*Num 10:35-36*). When David brought the Ark to Jerusalem, the Ark’s “rest” became permanent, as David expressed in a psalm of worship: “Arise, O Lord, and enter your resting place, along with the Ark, the symbol of your power” (*Ps 132:8*). God had chosen Mount Zion as his resting place.\n\n
28:4	idm49044					 **the** Lord** . . . has chosen me . . . to be king over Israel forever:** God’s selection of David actually began with Judah (*Gen 49:8-12*), culminated with David (*1 Sam 16:1-13*), and continued with Solomon (*1 Chr 28:5-6*, *10*). All subsequent kings reigned by virtue of God’s promise to David.\n\n
28:9	idm49057					 David’s message to Solomon did not stress the privileges of being chosen as king but emphasized the responsibilities of assuming the throne. The primary obligation was to **seek** the Lord, to **worship and serve him.** The Lord also required an unflinching resolve to build the Temple sanctuary.\n\n
28:11	idm49065					 God gave David the actual **plans for the Temple** through divine inspiration (*28:19*). On other occasions God also provided plans for the Tabernacle in the wilderness (*Exod 25:9*) and for the future Temple of Ezekiel (*Ezek 40:4*).\n\n
28:14	idm49075					 This list of vessels legitimized each object in the Temple by specifically recounting what God had communicated about them through David.\n\n
28:18	idm49081					 **for the** Lord**’s “chariot”—the gold cherubim:** The *cherubim* were various images of composite creatures found in connection with thrones and palaces. Ancient kings sat on cherub thrones. In God’s throne room (the Most Holy Place of Israel’s sanctuary), *cherubim* atop the Ark of the Covenant served a similar function (see *Exod 25:18-22*; *2 Sam 6:2*; *Ps 99:1*; cp. *Ezek 10*).\n\n
29:1	idm49096					 David persuaded the **assembly** of Israel’s leaders (*28:1*) to offer gifts to the Lord for the Temple. David’s own generous gift provided an example of the amounts leaders should consider. The Chronicler emphasizes that the heavy expense of building the Temple was not shouldered by Solomon alone; Solomon added to the contributions made by David and the leaders of Israel (see *22:14*).\n\n
29:6	idm49105					 Israel’s **leaders** gave **willingly***,* as had been the case with the Tabernacle (*Exod 25:1-7*).\n\n
29:7	idm49115					 **10,000 gold coins:** Persian *darics* were first minted during the reign of King Darius I of Persia (522–486 BC). In describing the Temple gifts presented during the days of Solomon, the Chronicler converted the information of his sources into the equivalents of his own day, just as the NLT converts Hebrew weights and measures to modern equivalents.\n\n
29:10	idm49124					 David’s prayer of praise concluded his addresses at Solomon’s coronation. The prayer extols God’s **power** and the **glory** of his **kingdom***,* and it serves to dedicate the offerings given for building the **Temple**. The prayer is composed of three parts: the doxology (*29:10b-13*), the presentation and dedication of the offerings (*29:14-17*), and the petition (*29:18-19*).\n\n
29:18	idm49138					 David did not ask God to grant power, victory, or riches, or for the establishment of Solomon’s kingdom. Instead he asked God to make the people of Israel, and Solomon in particular, **always want to obey** the Lord. Gaining this kind of heart attitude is a gift from the Lord; success and prosperity are secondary.\n\n
29:21	idm49145					 **Sacrifices** followed the speeches and prayers at Solomon’s coronation. **Solomon** and **Zadok** were **anointed***,* and Solomon acceded to the throne. Zadok was not beginning his priestly role but was being dedicated to serve in the Temple itself. (The descendants of Zadok are mentioned in *Ezek 40:46*; *43:19*; *44:15*; *48:11*.)\n\n
29:26	idm49160					 The Chronicler concludes his account of David’s reign with a stylized summary, similar in form to those used for all the kings of Israel and Judah (e.g., *1 Kgs 22:41-50*). Like Abraham (*Gen 25:8*) and Isaac (*Gen 35:29*), **David . . . died at a ripe old age** with **wealth** and **honor.**\n\n
29:29	idm49172					 The sources used for the chronicles of **David’s reign** are associated with three prophets, named in the order in which they appear in Chronicles: **Samuel** (*11:3*), **Nathan** (*17:1-27*), and **Gad** (*21:9*). The Chronicler had access to various sources in addition to the books of Samuel and Kings (see *study note on 9:1*; see also *1 Kgs 11:41-43*; *14:19-20*, *29-31*).\n\n
29:30	idm49189					 The concluding verse extols David by making him the center of the events of his time.\n\n
