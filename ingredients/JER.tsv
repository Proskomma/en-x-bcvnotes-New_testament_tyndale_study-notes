1:1	idm91101					 Jeremiah’s call is presented as a conversation; God spoke as a king to Jeremiah. Jeremiah’s objections show that he understood himself clearly. God responded to his objections with promises and compelling visions.\n\n
1:2	idm91107					 Jehoahaz and Jehoiachin are both missing from this list of kings. Neither of them reigned for longer than three months.\n\n
1:4	idm91113					 In his first **message** from the Lord, Jeremiah learned three important truths about God: his knowledge of all things, including individuals; his ability to choose individuals for specific tasks even before they come into existence; and his willingness to extend his authority to the people he calls. • God **set** Jeremiah **apart** to perform a special task and granted him the official status of a **prophet** when he **appointed** Jeremiah to that task. • Jeremiah’s ministry extended to the **nations**. Although he traveled away from the kingdom of Judah only three times (see *13:4-7*; *43:7-8*), his written materials have been read worldwide.\n\n
1:6	idm91127					 Jeremiah was **young** (probably a teenager).\n\n
1:7	idm91134					 God urged Jeremiah to look beyond himself to the importance of the task he was called to fulfill. He had to meet God’s requirements for a royal messenger, which included willingness to travel and the faithful delivery of the Lord’s messages.\n\n
1:9	idm91140					 When God placed his **words** in Jeremiah’s **mouth***,* he granted the prophet the status of an official royal messenger, including the ability to speak authoritatively in public.\n\n
1:11	idm91149					 These verses contain a play on words: The **almond tree** (Hebrew *shaqed*) is the first plant to flower, usually in late January or early February. The Lord wanted Jeremiah to know that he was always **watching** (Hebrew *shoqed*) him (see also *Ps 121:3-8*).\n\n
1:13	idm91160					 Like a flood of **boiling water***,* invading armies would bring **terror** to the people of Judah. Although Babylon was due east of Judah, the desert between them required that the Babylonian army attack Judah **from the north**.\n\n
1:17	idm91170					 Jeremiah was **afraid** of looking **foolish** as the Lord’s messenger (see *Jeremiah Book Introduction*, “Literary Features: The Messenger System”). In reality, it would be foolish of Jeremiah to refuse to do as God commanded.\n\n
1:18	idm91179					 A **fortified city** could hold out for a long time against a siege, often until the besieging army left to deal with a crisis elsewhere in the empire.\n\n
1:19	idm91186					 **I, the** Lord**, have spoken:** This statement has the force of a royal decree (see *study note on 2:2*).\n\n
2:1	idm91196					 Jeremiah used images of marriage, infidelity, and divorce to represent Judah’s spiritual apostasy.\n\n
2:2	idm91202					 **This is what the** Lord** says:** This and similar statements were equivalent to an official seal or a stamp of authority on a document. In many inscriptions of royal messages from the ancient Near East, the ruler stated that the message came from him and carried his authority. • The image of Israel as a **bride** had been used since the days of Hosea (about 760–722 BC; *Hos 2:2-19*; see also *Isa 54:6-8*; *62:5*). The concept is later applied to the redeemed community in heaven (*Rev 19:7*; *21:2*, *9*). • **long ago:** Following the exodus from Egypt, the Israelites were symbolically married to God when they agreed to a covenant relationship (*Exod 19:8*; *24:7*, *8*; *Deut 5:27*; *Ezek 16:8*). • **eager . . . to please** (Hebrew *khesed*): The Israelites made a commitment of loyalty to the covenant Lord (see *Deut 5:29*).\n\n
2:3	idm91228					 **Israel was holy** because the Lord had separated her from other nations to be his special **people** and reflect his character (*Exod 19:5-6*; *Lev 19*; *22:31-33*). • **first of his children:** Literally *the firstfruits of his harvest.* Mosaic law required the people to offer the first portion of every harvest to the Lord (*Exod 23:16*, *19*; *34:22*, *26*; *Lev 2:12*, *14*; *23:10*, *17*, *20*; *Num 18:12*; *28:26*; *Deut 18:4*; *26:10*; *Zech 14:20*). The people who made the covenant with God at Mount Sinai pledged their full commitment to the one true God. In return, the Lord protected them and punished their enemies during their journey to Canaan.\n\n
2:5	idm91255					 The Israelites **worshiped worthless idols***,* so their lives were ruled by delusions.\n\n
2:6	idm91263					 By not seeking **the** Lord*,* Israel’s ancestors showed that they had lost interest in their history. To them, the God of Israel was a delusion. They were only interested in the sensual excitement of the moment.\n\n
2:7	idm91272					 **defiled . . . corrupted:** See *Deut 4:25-28*.\n\n
2:8	idm91280					 Instead of teaching the people about the Lord, the leaders taught them about **Baal**.\n\n
2:9	idm91287					 **Therefore** often indicates that the Lord was about to issue a decree (e.g., *5:14*; *6:21*). • The Hebrew word translated **bring my case** can mean “strive” or “contend.” In addition, it might indicate combat, as in a fight or a battle, a verbal quarrel, or a legal argument in court. Because the leaders of the nation (*2:8*) failed to direct the people to him, the Lord was going to present his case against them. He was setting up a court in which he would be the plaintiff and the all-powerful Judge (*Ezek 20:35*, *36*; *Mic 6:2*). Jeremiah was a messenger, prosecutor, and advocate for the plaintiff.\n\n
2:10	idm91301					 **Kedar***,* an Arabic tribe descended from Ishmael, lived in the desert area east of the Jordan River Valley (see *49:28-33*; *Isa 21:16*).\n\n
2:11	idm91311					 No pagan nation **traded its gods** for those of another nation. Although the pagan nations generally worshiped the same nature deities (by different names), each nation essentially remained loyal to its own gods. Israel’s disloyalty is thus highlighted.\n\n
2:12	idm91318					 The **heavens** and the earth are often portrayed as witnesses to events among humans (see *51:48*; *Deut 32:1*, *43*; *1 Chr 16:31*; *Ps 96:11*; *Isa 1:2*; *44:23*; *49:13*).\n\n
2:13	idm91333					 The Israelites foolishly did **two evil things:** They **abandoned** the Lord, their true source of life, and they began to worship false gods that could not help them. • A **fountain of living** [i.e., running] **water** that flows throughout the year, even in drought, is a rare treasure (*Ps 36:9*; *John 4:14*). • The **cisterns** the Israelites dug after they entered Canaan were holes in the ground that were lined with plaster. These crude tanks collected water that drained from roofs in wet weather and provided water through the dry summers. The water could become putrid and dangerous to drink, and the plaster often cracked, letting the water drain out.\n\n
2:14	idm91346					 This historical review of Israel’s sin further emphasizes the folly, violence, arrogance, and despair of turning away from the true God to worship false pagan gods.\n\n
2:14	idm91352					 The Israelites had been rescued from slavery in Egypt, but they became slaves again in Jeremiah’s time through their covenants with Egypt and Assyria (*2:18*).\n\n
2:15	idm91359					 Jeremiah portrays the Assyrians who destroyed the northern kingdom (*2 Kgs 17:5-23*; *Nah 2:11-12*) as **lions**.\n\n
2:16	idm91368					 Another enemy, the **Egyptians***,* invaded from the south to pick up the pieces (*50:17*; *2 Kgs 23:29-37*). • **Memphis** and **Tahpanhes***,* Egypt’s major cities near the mouth of the Nile, were famous for their wealth.\n\n
2:18	idm91381					 Israel’s **alliances with Egypt** and **covenants with Assyria** (*2 Kgs 15:19–19:37*) provided no benefits, only sorrow. Neither the **Nile** in Egypt nor **the Euphrates** in Assyria ever helped Israel (*Isa 30:1-3*; *Hos 5:13*).\n\n
2:19	idm91394					 The decision to **abandon the** Lord brought further **punishment** and **shame** on Israel’s people (*Isa 3:9*; *Hos 5:5*).\n\n
2:20	idm91406					 **Long ago:** Lessons from Israel’s history concerning the Israelites’ rescue from **slavery** in Egypt had little effect, and the people of Israel defiantly refused to **serve** God (*Exod 19:8*; *34:15*; *Lev 26:13*; *Deut 12:2*; *Josh 24:16*; *Judg 10:16*; *Isa 57:5*, *7*). • **you have prostituted yourselves:** This metaphor was especially apt regarding the Israelites’ **bowing down to idols**. The Israelites backed their defiant words with rebellious behavior. They repeatedly worshiped fertility deities in hopes of good crops and green pastures. Their rituals were useless because the Lord is the one who had **planted** the Israelites in Canaan, and he creates life and fertility.\n\n
2:22	idm91426					 The metaphor changes from a planted vine to a dirty cloth that **soap or lye** cannot wash **clean**. However hard the Israelites scrubbed, their **guilt** was still apparent (cp. *Isa 1:18*).\n\n
2:23	idm91436					 Instead of acting like a faithful wife, Israel behaved like a wild animal in heat (*2:23-25*), a thief (*2:26-30*), and a prostitute (*2:31–3:5*).\n\n
2:23	idm91445					 The people protested that it was **not true** that they were **Baal** worshipers (cp. *2:25*). Archaeologists have found small plaques showing an Asherah (female goddess) and a male god resembling Baal, but their inscriptions bear the name of the Lord (*Yahweh*). Baal worship was apparently sometimes disguised as worship of Israel’s God.\n\n
2:25	idm91455					 The Israelites confessed to the Baal worship that they had earlier denied (*2:23*), thus revealing the true state of their hearts.\n\n
2:26	idm91462					 Israel’s leaders felt no **shame** for the evil they did; any contrition they expressed in the face of God’s punishment stemmed from selfishness, not repentance (*Ps 78:34-37*).\n\n
2:27	idm91470					 These idols of a **father** and **mother** probably represented Baal and Asherah. • **in times of trouble they cry out:** See, e.g., *Judg 10:10*; *Isa 26:16*; *Hos 5:15*.\n\n
2:28	idm91482					 The Israelites were foolishly devoted to **many gods** (*11:13*; *Deut 32:37*; *Judg 10:14*; *2 Kgs 17:30-31*), who were all powerless to help them. • Jeremiah addressed the individual tribe of **Judah***,* the people standing before him.\n\n
2:30	idm91495					 **killed your prophets:** See *26:20-23*.\n\n
2:31	idm91503					 The Lord’s anger turned to an appeal. He questioned why the Israelites considered life in obedience to him a **desert** of death and deprivation (*Num 21:5*), full of the evil and terror of **darkness** (*Job 24:17*; *1 Jn 1:5-6*).\n\n
2:32	idm91514					 For centuries, the Israelites had **forgotten** the Lord, their husband (*13:25*; *Ps 106:21*; *Hos 8:14*).\n\n
2:33	idm91524					 The Israelites would **plot and scheme** with their **lovers***,* their neighbors with powerful armies, by making treaties to gain the protection that the Lord had already promised them. God considered this an act of prostitution that left a stain of **blood** on Israel’s character. Like their pagan neighbors, Israel now crushed its own **innocent** and **poor** (*7:6*; *2 Kgs 21:16*; *24:4*).\n\n
2:35	idm91539					 Israel’s sinful condition was evident in the people’s arrogant retort. They claimed that they were innocent, and that God was needlesslyhad needless **angry** with them. God responded to the people’s denial of guilt by decreeing that he would be severe in his punishment and that he would not tolerate their denial of wrongdoing (*Prov 23:13*; *Mal 2:17*; *3:8*; *1 Jn 1:8*, *10*).\n\n
2:36	idm91551					 Judah, in its unfaithfulness to the Lord, chose unreliable and unfaithful allies. The leaders sought political help from neighbors such as **Egypt**—as false a friend as **Assyria** had been a century before.\n\n
3:1	idm91559					 **Adultery** was solid grounds for divorce (*Deut 24:1-2*; *Hos 2:1-5*; *9:1*). Judah committed spiritual adultery, smugly assuming that God would have no objections (*Ezek 16:26*; *Zech 1:3*).\n\n
3:1	idm91571					 The law prohibited a man from marrying a woman he had previously divorced who had then married another man (*Deut 24:1-4*). A woman who had **many lovers** was even less likely to be received back.\n\n
3:2	idm91579					 As the Lord’s bride (see *2:2*), Israel was not supposed to commit **adultery with other gods**.\n\n
3:3	idm91587					 The Lord did not condone the **shameless** behavior of the people. He had already brought on a drought, and their sexual rituals had no effect against it (*14:3-6*; *Lev 26:19*; *Zeph 3:5*).\n\n
3:4	idm91597					 Instead of confessing their sins, the people tried to cover them over with sweet **talk**. However, God saw through their deception. They were inadvertently correct that he would not **be angry forever** (*Ps 103:9*; *Isa 57:16*; *Mal 1:6*), though he promised to vent his wrath (*Jer 4:7*).\n\n
3:6	idm91609					 The Lord had been addressing the kingdom of Judah as “Israel” (*2:1–3:5*), emphasizing their identity as his people. Now the Lord distinguishes between **Israel***,* the northern kingdom that had been destroyed (*2 Kgs 17*), and the kingdom of **Judah**. Since the people of the southern kingdom had learned nothing from the fate of the northern kingdom, they were doomed to experience the same fate. • **Josiah** (640–609 BC) promoted a return to historic faith and practice in 621 BC (*2 Chr 34:29-33*).\n\n
3:7	idm91624					 King Josiah’s reforms failed to reach many of the common people. The love of idol worship common in northern Israel also continued among the farmers and shepherds of Judah. They failed to learn from the fate of the northern tribes, and even surpassed their practice of **adultery** (see *Ezek 16:47-48*).\n\n
3:8	idm91632					 **divorced:** See *2 Kgs 17:23*.\n\n
3:9	idm91640					 **land has been polluted:** As a result of Israel’s apostasy, fertile fields no longer produced crops and sheep did not graze on green grass (*Isa 57:6*).\n\n
3:10	idm91648					 Like the northern tribes of Israel, the people of Judah did not see anything immoral about idol worship; they treated the Lord’s objections lightly. The people did not really repent, but **pretended** to do so under the pressure of Josiah’s authority (*2 Chr 34:32*). Their religion was tainted with deception (*Jer 12:2*; *Hos 7:14*).\n\n
3:11	idm91658					 The Lord appealed to Israel to repent, return, and be reconciled to him (contrast *2:1–3:10*). Israel had sinned and had received its punishment. Now the people of Judah were sinning even more brazenly than their northern kin, and they ignored the lesson the Lord had taught Israel (*Ezek 16:51-52*). But it was still not too late to repent and become the **blessing to the nations** (*Jer 4:1-2*) that God intended them to be (*Gen 12:3*).\n\n
3:12	idm91669					 In this decree, the Lord calls the survivors of the **faithless** Israel of a century before to **come home**. God’s solid, underlying character is **merciful***,* and he desires to extend salvation and restoration (*12:15*; *31:20*; *33:26*; *2 Kgs 17:6*; *Ps 86:15*).\n\n
3:13	idm91684					 **acknowledge your guilt . . . Admit that you rebelled . . . Confess that you refused to listen:** Through these three elements of repentance, the people could demonstrate their willingness to receive the Lord’s salvation and restoration (*Lev 26:40*; *Deut 30:1-5*).\n\n
3:14	idm91693					 **Return home:** The Lord had spoken to all Israel as a husband to an adulterous wife, but now he refers to Israel as **wayward children**. The Lord would bring selected exiles back to the Promised Land (*31:6*, *32*; *Hos 2:19-20*; *Rom 11:5*). • **to the land of Israel:** Hebrew *to Zion*.\n\n
3:15	idm91707					 If the people of Israel repented, the Lord wanted to give them more than just the land. He also promised to provide leaders (**shepherds**) who would **guide** them **with knowledge and understanding** (*23:4*, *31*; *Ezek 34:11*; *Acts 20:28*; *Eph 4:11*).\n\n
3:16	idm91721					 When Judah was decimated and Jerusalem was destroyed, the land was nearly empty of people. But in the future, the devastated land would **once more** be **filled with people**. Its inhabitants would not dwell on the past or need the **Ark** to remind them of God’s presence (*23:3*; *Isa 49:19*; *65:17*).\n\n
3:17	idm91733					 In the future, the city of **Jerusalem** would be a global center of worship called **The Throne of the** Lord*,* and people from **nations** around the earth would renounce their rebellion (*7:24*; *Deut 29:19*; *Isa 60:9*).\n\n
3:18	idm91747					 **Judah and Israel** would be among the people flowing to Jerusalem. The Lord would mercifully bring them **from exile** and once again settle them in the Promised Land (*31:8*; *Isa 11:13*; *Ezek 37:16-22*; *Hos 1:11*; *Amos 9:15*).\n\n
3:19	idm91760					 **But:** This transitional word emphasizes the contrast between what the Lord **wanted** and the actual situation. The Lord **would love to treat** his people as his precious **children***,* but he could not. The covenant marriage between God and his people had been ruptured by the **faithless wife**. The Lord could not overlook this sin (*Isa 48:8*).\n\n
3:21	idm91773					 The people, held captive in Assyria, cried out that they had repented of their sins. However, their words were insincere, and the Lord rejected their plea. God was telling his people that if they were really going to turn back to him, they had to abandon the altars on the hills where they had worshiped idols and purge their religion of every trace of idolatry.\n\n
3:22	idm91779					 The Lord heard the touching prayer of devotion; the people affirmed their acceptance of **the** Lord as their **God** (*31:7*; *Pss 38:18*; *121:1-2*). • The people even confessed that they had worshiped **idols** and engaged in **religious orgies**. They admitted that all this was a **delusion** (*Jer 11:13*; *14:20*; *Hos 9:10*) and acknowledged that **salvation** is found only in **the** Lord. Their **ancestors** had **squandered** their wealth by killing their animals and children in honor of Baal.\n\n
3:22	idm91802					 The Lord did not forget his **children**. Out of the depths of his being, he called them to **come back** so that he could **heal** them. He desired to set aside his anger and pour forth his love (*30:17*; *33:6*; *Hos 6:1*; *14:4*).\n\n
4:1	idm91815					 The Lord saw that despite their lovely prayer, the people did not intend to **throw away** their **idols** or change their lifestyle (*15:19*; *Joel 2:12*).\n\n
4:2	idm91825					 **As surely as the** Lord** lives:** The correct attitude when offering a prayer of confession and making oaths reflects **truth, justice, and righteousness**. *Truth* means that the inner attitudes and thoughts of those praying match the words they utter. *Justice* means living by the laws of the Lord, who will judge the earth. *Righteousness* means that people relate to others in accordance with the Lord’s Spirit and the moral standards he has established. This kind of prayer requires a radical transformation of people’s inner lives and outer lifestyle (*Gen 22:18*; *Deut 10:20*; *Ps 72:18*; *Isa 48:1*; *1 Cor 1:31*). If the Israelites returned to the Lord in this way, the people would be blessed, and their influence would flow out as a **blessing** to all **the nations of the world**. Their changed lives would cause people of the world to **come** and join in a chorus of **praise** to God’s **name**.\n\n
4:3	idm91848					 These verses bring the kingdom of **Judah** and its capital, **Jerusalem***,* to center stage in God’s courtroom. The Lord decreed that he would judge Jerusalem at the hands of the Babylonians.\n\n
4:3	idm91857					 Sinners must intentionally face their rebellion and change their ways through confession and repentance (*Hos 10:12*; cp. *Matt 13:1-9*).\n\n
4:4	idm91865					 To deal with their sin, the people needed to give up the **pride** and **power** that were so precious to them (*Deut 10:16*; *30:6*; *Amos 5:6*; *Mark 9:43*; *Rom 2:28*; *Col 2:11*). • **surrender your pride and power:** Literally *circumcise yourselves.* Circumcision was a covenant sign of submission to God.\n\n
4:5	idm91881					 God was opening the pot of boiling water (see *1:13-14*) and pouring out a cruel army upon the people (*8:14*; *50:2*; *Josh 10:20*; *Isa 62:10*).\n\n
4:7	idm91892					 The coming army of Babylonian soldiers was like a cruel and vicious **lion** (see *2:15*). With power and savagery, it would wipe out everything, leaving houses empty and in **ruins** (*25:9*, *38*; *50:17*; *2 Kgs 24:1*; *Isa 1:7*; *6:11*; *Ezek 26:7-10*; *Dan 7:4*).\n\n
4:8	idm91909					 The Israelites were in trouble with the Lord and needed to make things right with him. Putting an army in the field or organizing guerrilla bands would be futile. Instead, Jeremiah called for the people to repent by **mourning** and by weeping with **broken hearts** (*Isa 22:12*). By using the pronoun **us***,* the prophet seems to include himself in the need for repentance (see *Jer 10:24*).\n\n
4:9	idm91921					 The impact of the foreign invasion would show Judah’s leaders that they were not as invincible as they believed (*48:41*; *Isa 22:3-5*).\n\n
4:10	idm91929					 Jeremiah was confused and offended because he and **the people** thought that God had promised **peace for Jerusalem**. However, these promises were false prophecies (*6:14*; *14:13*; *23:16-17*).\n\n
4:11	idm91940					 The Lord’s **people** would soon feel the **burning wind** and **roaring blast** of God’s judgment (*13:24*; *Hos 13:15*).\n\n
4:13	idm91951					 Like his countrymen, Jeremiah was fearful when he heard that the invasion from the north had begun (*Deut 28:49*; *Isa 5:28*; *Lam 4:19*; *Hos 8:1*; *Hab 1:8*).\n\n
4:14	idm91962					 Jeremiah still hoped that his people would **cleanse** their **heart***,* get rid of their **evil thoughts***,* and make a clean break with idolatry. Otherwise, they would face God’s judgment (*4:1*; *6:19*; *13:27*; *50:17*; *Prov 1:22*; *Isa 1:16*; *Jas 4:8*).\n\n
4:17	idm91980					 The foreign armies already surrounded the capital city. The impending attack was due to the people’s rebellion against the Lord.\n\n
4:19	idm91986					 When Jeremiah **heard . . . trumpets** and the **battle cries** of the invaders who brought **desolation***,* he realized that his own family and other people he knew were being killed or left homeless. Jeremiah could not escape the effects of God’s judgment even though he was faithfully serving the Lord (*9:1*, *19*; *10:19-20*; *20:9*; *2 Kgs 25:11*; *2 Chr 36:20*; *Ps 42:7*; *Isa 15:5*; *16:11*; *21:3*; *22:4*; *Ezek 7:26*).\n\n
4:23	idm92008					 In Jeremiah’s vision, **the** Lord**’s fierce anger** took precedence over his creative love (*10:10*; *12:4*; *Isa 5:25*; *24:19*; *Ezek 38:20*; *Zeph 1:3*). He was undoing the order of creation (see *Gen 1:2-3*).\n\n
4:28	idm92024					 At funerals in Hebrew society, it was customary for people to **mourn** and be **draped in black** (cp. *Isa 5:30*; *50:3*). The Lord had determined the people’s guilt, and he promised to be true to his word (*Jer 5:10*; *30:11*, *24*; *Isa 5:30*; *46:10-11*).\n\n
4:29	idm92039					 **flee . . . hide . . . run:** Panic gripped the people of Judah in reaction to the horrors of war. Their arrogance and smug confidence disappeared (see *6:23-24*).\n\n
4:30	idm92047					 Strangely, some people acted as if nothing serious were happening. They tried to ignore the enemy, but their future was bleak. The enemy would **kill** them (*22:20*, *22*; *2 Kgs 9:30*; *Isa 22:13*; *Lam 1:2*, *19*; *Ezek 23:9-10*, *22*, *40-42*).\n\n
4:31	idm92063					 The people in Jerusalem felt such intense anguish that Jeremiah likened their pain to the agony of a woman **giving birth to her first child**. Like such women, **beautiful Jerusalem** was desperate (*13:21*; *23:23*; *30:6*; *Isa 1:15*; *42:14*; *Lam 1:17*).\n\n
5:1	idm92077					 A **just** person lives according to God’s laws and deals with other people accordingly. An **honest person** is dependable, truthful, and faithful to God. Jeremiah did not find either justice or honesty. Although some people were **under oath***,* their claims of innocence were false. Their behavior showed that they had perjured themselves (*4:2*; *7:9*; *Gen 18:23-32*; *Isa 48:1*; *Ezek 22:30*; *Titus 1:15-16*).\n\n
5:3	idm92093					 Even when **crushed** by the disaster of war, the people ignored God and **refused to repent** of their sins (*Isa 9:13*).\n\n
5:4	idm92102					 Jeremiah searched for an economic reason behind Jerusalem’s rebellion but found that the **leaders***,* despite their advantages, were as rebellious as the uneducated **poor**. • A wooden **yoke** was placed on the neck of a farm animal, with **chains** attached to a plow or another implement for working the fields (cp. *27:2-12*; *Ps 2:3*).\n\n
5:6	idm92115					 The Babylonians would attack like a **lion***,* a **wolf***,* and a **leopard**. These ferocious beasts were capable of destroying human life. The people’s **rebellion** and **sins** were very serious to the Lord (*4:7*; *30:14-15*; *Ps 104:20*; *Ezek 22:27*; *Hos 13:7*; *Hab 1:8*; *Zeph 3:3*).\n\n
5:7	idm92135					 These verses list the evidence of sins the people had committed, including rejection of the Lord, submission to pagan deities, and sexual misconduct (*7:9*; *12:16*; *Num 25:1-3*; *Deut 32:21*; *Josh 23:7*; *Zeph 1:5*; *Gal 4:8*). Idolatry and adultery were closely connected in Israel because both represented the breach of an exclusive covenant.\n\n
5:9	idm92148					 The Lord regarded the people’s sins as worthy of punishment (*9:9*; *13:27*; *29:23*; *Ezek 22:11*).\n\n
5:10	idm92158					 The Lord delivered a decree to destroy Judah’s **vineyards***,* which probably represented Judah itself (see *Isa 5:1-7*; *27:2-6*). The people were ignoring the Lord. They did not belong to him as his children, and he could not overlook the **treachery** of their love for idols (*Jer 3:6*; *4:27*; *7:27*).\n\n
5:12	idm92172					 Even with the enemy looming on the northern horizon, the people thought that nothing bad would happen to them (*14:13*; *Isa 47:8*). They did not respect **God’s prophets** (literally *the prophets*) either. • Some interpreters end the people’s quote with *Jer 5:12* and attribute *5:13* to the Lord. The **windbags** would then refer to false prophets.\n\n
5:14	idm92185					 The approaching army was probably that of Babylon, which attacked Jerusalem in 605 BC. The Lord called the Babylonians to carry out the punishment he had promised (see *Deut 28:15-62*).\n\n
5:15	idm92193					 The Babylonian language was a Semitic **language** like Hebrew, but the Israelites did not **understand** it.\n\n
5:16	idm92201					 The soldiers of the well-trained and well-equipped Babylonian army treated their victims viciously and destroyed everything of value in the lands they conquered (cp. *Hab 1:6-10*).\n\n
5:18	idm92208					 The Lord comforted Jeremiah with the knowledge that the destruction would not be total, and he prepared the prophet to respond to those who wondered why the Lord would bring such severe judgment upon them.\n\n
5:20	idm92214					 **to Israel:** Literally *to the house of Jacob.* The names “Jacob” and “Israel” are often interchanged throughout the Old Testament, referring sometimes to the individual patriarch and sometimes to the nation. • To be **foolish** is to engage in rash and immoral behavior that ignores consequences. • **senseless:** Literally *no heart.* When “heart” is used in a negative sense, it means that a person or group does not desire to do moral acts and so disdains the intelligent behavior that is pleasing to God. • The people’s **ears** and **eyes** functioned (see *study note on 6:10*), but they stubbornly shut out the true meaning of what they heard and saw (*Isa 6:9*; *Ezek 12:2*; *Mark 8:18*).\n\n
5:22	idm92231					 The people should at least **respect** the Lord for his power and **tremble** at the thought of his unleashing that power against them. If even the mighty sea was unable to **pass the boundaries** the Lord had **set** for it, surely the rebellion of little Jerusalem would fail.\n\n
5:23	idm92241					 The people falsely thought that they could do without the Lord, who provided **rain** for their crops (*Deut 11:14*). This **wickedness** caused them to lose **wonderful blessings** and **good things** (*Jer 3:3*).\n\n
5:26	idm92253					 Among the people of Jerusalem were **wicked men** who grew **fat and sleek** by oppressing **orphans and . . . the poor** (*7:6*).\n\n
5:29	idm92263					 The people’s sins (*5:26-28*) fully justified the Lord’s punishment, but the religious leaders committed several more. The **prophets** told lies and called them **prophecies** from the Lord (*14:14*; *Ezek 13:6*). The **priests***,* assigned to serve the people, had become tyrants who dominated the people **with an iron hand**. Amazingly, the people approved of their leaders’ new roles, even though this situation left them unprepared for the doom descending upon them (*Mic 2:11*).\n\n
6:1	idm92278					 The invasion from the **north***,* probably by the Babylonians in 605 BC, was moving toward the kingdom of Judah. As the Lord’s messenger, Jeremiah had the duty of arousing the people so that they could find shelter.\n\n
6:1	idm92287					 Jeremiah’s parents lived in the tribal area of **Benjamin***,* a narrow strip of land oriented east to west a few miles north of **Jerusalem**. Amos had lived in **Tekoa***,* about twelve miles south of Jerusalem (*Amos 1:1*). • **Beth-hakkerem** was about three miles south of Jerusalem, overlooking Bethlehem.\n\n
6:2	idm92300					 Jeremiah portrayed the commanding officers of the invading army as **shepherds** who led their flocks of soldiers to camp **around the city**. The initial plan was to strike the city walls **at noon***,* when the attackers could see their work. But the people in the city were so weakened that the **attack at night** was just as effective (see *2 Kgs 25:1-4*).\n\n
6:6	idm92312					 The Lord was orchestrating the attack by the Babylonians. He instructed the invading enemy to construct **battering rams** for breaking through the **walls***,* and to build dirt ramps against the walls for easy access (*32:24*).\n\n
6:8	idm92322					 Even at this late hour, the purpose of the Lord’s accusations was to make the people **listen** and turn back to him.\n\n
6:9	idm92329					 Little time remained for the people to turn back to the one true God. The survivors of the invasion would be like leftover **grapes** on vines; God, the **harvester***,* would track down the survivors to ensure that everyone in Israel experienced this punishment.\n\n
6:10	idm92338					 In a series of rhetorical questions, Jeremiah, the messenger-prosecutor, revealed his love for the people; he then expressed his disbelief when the people responded with scorn. After presenting evidence of sins committed by the people from the lowest level of society to the highest, the prophet transmitted a divine decree. The future tense of his indictment suggests that the message was given before the invasion.\n\n
6:10	idm92344					 The people could literally **hear***,* because their retorts were filled with **scorn***,* but they did not take the Lord’s message seriously (cp. *Acts 7:51*).\n\n
6:11	idm92355					 Jeremiah shared the Lord’s **fury** toward the people; he could not contain his feelings.\n\n
6:13	idm92362					 The people were so **ruled by greed** that they sought gain even by violent methods (cp. *Prov 1:11-19*; see also *Isa 56:11*; *Mic 3:5*, *11*). The religious leaders were **frauds***;* they did not function as their titles indicated they should.\n\n
6:14	idm92375					 The sinful condition of God’s people was the **mortal wound** that warranted God’s judgment. Instead of calling for repentance, the religious leaders gave the people unfounded **assurances of peace** (*23:17*; *Ezek 13:10*).\n\n
6:16	idm92385					 The Lord again appealed to the people to repent and warned them of the terrible consequences that awaited them if they refused.\n\n
6:16	idm92391					 Following **the old, godly way** of God’s laws (*Mal 4:4*) would lead to **rest for** the people’s **souls** (cp. *Matt 11:29*).\n\n
6:17	idm92402					 Prophets were the Lord’s **watchmen** (*25:4*; *Isa 58:1*; *Ezek 3:17*).\n\n
6:18	idm92412					 All the **nations** would know that **disaster** had come upon the Lord’s people because they had **rejected** his **word** (*19:3*; *Prov 1:31*; *Isa 1:2*).\n\n
6:20	idm92425					 The offerings of expensive **frankincense** and **fragrant** perfumes were repulsive to the Lord because of his people’s rebellion (*7:21-23*; *Exod 30:23*; *Pss 40:6*; *50:7-9*; *Isa 1:11*; *43:24*; *66:3*; *Amos 5:21*; *Mic 6:6-7*).\n\n
6:22	idm92442					 This dialogue between Jeremiah and the Lord probably took place at the beginning of the Babylonian invasion in 605 BC. In these three poems, Jeremiah declares the Lord’s message (*6:22-23*), identifies with his people’s fear, and urges them to repent quickly (*6:24-26*). He then receives a heart-to-heart message from the Lord (*6:27-30*).\n\n
6:22	idm92452					 The Lord reminded the people that the impending invasion was not fictitious; the soldiers had real **bows and spears** (*Isa 13:18*). • **sound like a roaring sea:** The sound of tens of thousands of soldiers with cavalry and chariots must have been terrifying (*Isa 5:27-30*).\n\n
6:26	idm92462					 Jeremiah advised the people to put on **burlap and sit among the ashes** to show remorse for their sin and to beg for God’s mercy (*Isa 58:5*; *Amos 8:10*; *Jon 3:6*; *Mic 1:10*).\n\n
6:27	idm92473					 The Lord interrupted Jeremiah’s lamentation and brought him back to his commissioned task. God depicted the prophet as a silversmith working with raw ore. The refining process was going to reveal that the silver content of the ore was so small as to be worthless.\n\n
6:27	idm92479					 Jeremiah’s prophetic task was at odds with the empathy that he felt for his **people**. Like a metalworker, he was to direct the fire of criticism on the people to **determine** their **quality** in the light of God’s standards.\n\n
6:28	idm92488					 The people’s dross was spiritual; it included rebellion against God, **slander** of other people, a **hard** and stubborn attitude, and a disposition to **lead others into corruption** (*Ezek 22:18*).\n\n
6:29	idm92498					 To expose their wickedness, God was fanning the **flames** with the **bellows** of his judgment. But no valuable silver appeared; only the dross of **wickedness** remained (*Zech 13:9*; *Mal 3:3*).\n\n
6:30	idm92509					 The people, the **Rejected Silver***,* must be thrown away (*Isa 1:22*).\n\n
7:1	idm92518					 Jeremiah disabused the people of their belief that God’s **Temple** would guarantee their safety (cp. *26:1-6*).\n\n
7:1	idm92526					 The people were probably at **the entrance of the** Lord**’s Temple** for one of the annual festivals (see also *17:19*; *26:2*).\n\n
7:3	idm92537					 Pagans believed that a symbol was identical with what it represented, so in the paganized worship of Jeremiah’s day, the Temple *was* God’s heavenly house. It would be ridiculous to think that enemies could destroy it. To reinforce that idea, the people vigorously repeated a chant, **The** Lord**’s Temple is here**. However, **the** Lord** of Heaven’s Armies** needed no earthly house (*2 Sam 7:6-7*; *1 Kgs 8:27*); whatever security the Israelites obtained from the Temple came from the Lord himself, and only on his terms (*1 Kgs 6:12*).\n\n
7:5	idm92553					 Idol worship had harmed the people—spiritually, because idols were delusions; socially, because their behavior destroyed fellowship; and politically, because they did not think foreign armies could conquer them. Unless the people changed, they had no future in the Promised Land (*Exod 22:21-24*; *Deut 4:40*; *6:14-15*).\n\n
7:8	idm92562					 **steal, murder, commit adultery, lie:** The people’s behavior violated most of the Ten Commandments (*Exod 20:3-7*, *13-17*). • **burn incense . . . chant:** Israel’s relationship with God did not depend on any magical, ritual connection with him. It depended on their keeping the terms of his covenant. The things they were doing violated the terms of that relationship and denied the Lord’s holy character.\n\n
7:11	idm92572					 **a den of thieves:** See *5:29-31*; *Matt 21:13*; *Mark 11:17*; *Luke 19:46*.\n\n
7:12	idm92583					 God had allowed the Philistines to capture the Ark of the Covenant and destroy the Tabernacle at Shiloh when the people tried to use the Ark as a magical talisman (*1 Sam 4:1-11*). In the same way, he would allow the Babylonians to destroy the Temple.\n\n
7:12	idm92590					 **Shiloh** was a hill located halfway between Shechem and Jerusalem. The **Tabernacle** had been set up there after the conquest of Canaan led by Joshua (*Josh 18:1*, *6-19*; *Judg 18:31*). It remained the center of worship for the tribes of Israel until Shiloh was destroyed about 1045 BC by the Philistine army (see *Jer 26:6*; *Ps 78:60*).\n\n
7:13	idm92604					 The people of the northern kingdom had previously done what Judah was now doing. God had sent many prophets who **spoke** and **called out** to them (*2 Kgs 17:22-23*; *2 Chr 36:15-16*), but they **would not listen** and **refused to answer**. The Lord had spared Jerusalem and the Temple when the northern tribes were taken into exile by the Assyrians in 722 BC; this time, the Temple would be destroyed.\n\n
7:16	idm92617					 The Lord commanded Jeremiah not to **pray . . . for these people** because it would not do any good (*15:1*; cp. *Exod 32:10*; *Deut 9:14*).\n\n
7:17	idm92627					 Pagan worship had become a family affair; each member of a family provided some part of the ritual. The object of their worship was Ashtoreth, the **Queen of Heaven***,* the mother goddess of the Canaanites with her family of deities (see *44:17-19*).\n\n
7:19	idm92636					 God’s law was made for human benefit. Those who refused to follow his instructions **hurt themselves** (cp. *Mark 2:27*).\n\n
7:20	idm92644					 The people’s **offerings** and **sacrifices** meant nothing to the Lord if disobedience ruled in their hearts. Their sacrifices did not manipulate God into doing something he would rather not do. Rather, they embodied the people’s trust in God’s gracious forgiveness. When the people tried to use the sacrificial system to manipulate God while living self-serving lives, it only infuriated him (*Isa 1:10-16*; *Amos 5:21-27*). Obedience to God allows for a personal relationship between God and his people that provides the basis for a wonderful future (*Hos 6:6*).\n\n
7:24	idm92655					 Throughout their history, the Israelites had rejected the messages of the Lord’s **prophets** (*2 Chr 36:15*; *Mark 12:1-10*).\n\n
7:27	idm92664					 The Lord instructed Jeremiah to continue to proclaim his messages even though the people of Judah had totally rejected the Lord and would not listen (cp. *Ezek 2:7*). The appropriate action for Jeremiah to take was to **shave** his **head***,* mourn, and **weep alone on the mountains** (cp. *Job 1:20*).\n\n
7:30	idm92676					 This message decreed death for the people of Judah. It was finally fulfilled in the destruction of Jerusalem (586 BC).\n\n
7:30	idm92683					 The **valley of Ben-Hinnom** began on the west side of Jerusalem and continued around the south side. This narrow, steep-sided valley opened into the Kidron Valley and was the city’s combined garbage dump and graveyard. The bodies of the poor who were murdered or died of disease were dumped there, and child sacrifice (a practice totally abhorrent to the Lord; see *2 Chr 28:3*; *33:6*) was performed there. The valley was also known as **Topheth** (*2 Kgs 23:10*; *Isa 30:33*), perhaps referring to the ritual drums (Hebrew *top*) or to the sacrificial fires (*tap*) that were used there. In the New Testament it is called Gehenna, and Jesus compared hell to the fire that burned continuously in that valley (see *study note on Matt 5:29*). Before long, it would be known as **the Valley of Slaughter***,* because the siege and destruction of Jerusalem (588–586 BC) would fill the valley to overflowing with the bodies of the slain.\n\n
8:1	idm92701					 Scattering the **bones** of the dead was the ultimate act of contempt for a defeated nation. Jerusalem’s favorite pagan deities—**the sun, moon, and stars**—would be unable to prevent it from happening.\n\n
8:4	idm92709					 These three short poems were probably delivered during Jehoiakim’s reign.\n\n
8:4	idm92715					 These verses itemize the evidence of Judah’s sins. The people had fallen into idolatrous ritual sex and followed the ways of idol worship. They remained in their delusions because their minds and hearts were trapped by **lies***,* a term that is often applied to idols (*5:3*, *6*; *7:24*; *9:6*; *Prov 24:16*; *Isa 44:20*; *Amos 5:2*; *Mic 7:8*).\n\n
8:6	idm92731					 The Lord, who can **listen to** everything (cp. *Luke 12:3*), heard the people even when they talked in private. Not **a word** correlated with reality, and no one was **sorry for doing wrong**. Like **a horse galloping into battle** with no thought of death or danger, they did not consider the consequences of their sins.\n\n
8:7	idm92742					 **stork . . . turtledove . . . swallow . . . crane:** The Creator gave certain birds the ability to navigate the sky from summer nesting places to winter feeding grounds, and they always follow those instincts precisely. By contrast, the people of Israel ignored God’s revelations and the covenant laws he had established.\n\n
8:8	idm92749					 The people protested God’s judgment because they possessed **the word of the** Lord. God condemned them because they did not put his word into practice (cp. *Matt 7:26*; *Jas 1:22-25*).\n\n
8:8	idm92759					 The **teachers***,* highly valued in the government and in the Temple, included priests and non-priestly Levites. They were experts in explaining the Sinai covenant, and they were honored for their knowledge of covenant doctrine and the fine points of the legal system related to it. Now they were promoting the pagan viewpoints of King Jehoiakim and his officials as an updated **word of the** Lord (cp. *study note on 2:23*). The Lord called these new doctrines **lies**.\n\n
8:9	idm92771					 The phrase **wise teachers** is sarcastic—the Lord called their teachings **foolishness** and exposed their motivation as **greed** (cp. *Job 28:28*). This sin ruled the lives of the **prophets and priests***,* making all of them **frauds**.\n\n
8:10	idm92784					 These verses repeat *6:13-15*.\n\n
8:13	idm92791					 Having presented the evidence (see *study note on 8:4-7*), the Lord now decreed the punishment of the elite sinners. They would be consumed, along with the land’s produce. • **I, the** Lord**, have spoken:** The Lord placed his authority behind his decree.\n\n
8:14	idm92801					 These people had heard Jeremiah publicly deliver the decree of the Lord; they now realized that they deserved their punishment because they had **sinned against the** Lord. Though their doom was sealed, they still did not seek forgiveness for their sins.\n\n
8:16	idm92809					 See *6:22-23*.\n\n
8:18	idm92816					 The priests in the Temple expertly memorized and repeated carefully crafted prayers as rituals in the Temple worship. Repeating the precise wording of the prayers was thought to be very important; failure to do so drained the prayers of their perceived magical power. The character of the priests who uttered the prayers was considered of minor importance. The same was true of lamentations. In contrast, Jeremiah’s prayers and lamentations were spontaneous and occupied him to the depths of his being.\n\n
8:20	idm92822					 Instead of confessing their sin, the people surrendered to despair. The **harvest** time of their salvation was **gone** and they were **not saved**.\n\n
8:21	idm92831					 Jeremiah empathized with the suffering of his people. The closeness between the Lord and his prophet means that sometimes the first-person pronouns refer to the Lord as well—the Lord also hurts **with the hurt** of his **people** (cp. *Matt 23:37*).\n\n
8:22	idm92840					 The **medicine in Gilead** consisted of sticky sap that oozed from cuts made in the trunks or branches of small evergreen trees in the highlands east of the Jordan River. Merchants who sold this resin to the people claimed that it had healing powers. • Jeremiah saw the people’s need for God to heal their deep spiritual sickness. The people saw only the physical manifestations of God’s judgment against them and refused to acknowledge that their spiritual rebellion was the source of their problems. The African-American spiritual “There Is a Balm in Gilead” points to Jesus as the ultimate balm for our souls.\n\n
9:2	idm92847					 Jeremiah wanted to run away and build a **shack in the desert** to blot the reality of war from his memory (*Ps 55:6-8*). He understood that his people were **adulterers** and **liars** who deserved their punishment, but he did not want to be in Jerusalem to watch it happen.\n\n
9:3	idm92857					 The heavenly court was still in session (see *study note on 2:9*); the divine Judge lectured the people about the charges facing them and justified the severity of the verdict. Jeremiah interrupted the Lord’s speech twice to respond to the Lord’s messages (*9:10*, *12*).\n\n
9:3	idm92866					 The Lord did not scold Jeremiah for his outburst. Instead, the Lord recited the guilty charges against his people. • The comparison with **bows** indicates that the people’s **lies** were deliberately aimed to harm their targets.\n\n
9:4	idm92874					 The **lie** of idolatry was at the root of an entire culture of deceit. • The word **brother***,* as a synonym for **neighbor***,* indicates that even the closest relationships were polluted with fraud.\n\n
9:7	idm92885					 The Lord announced that he would place the people in the **crucible** of affliction (*6:27-30*; *Isa 1:25*). The three rhetorical questions challenged Jeremiah or anyone else to suggest a possible alternative to the Lord’s actions or to explain why they were not justified.\n\n
9:10	idm92894					 It is unclear whether these words were uttered by the Lord or by Jeremiah. If the words belong to the Lord, they indicate that he pronounced judgment from a broken heart. If they come from Jeremiah, they show the depths of pain in his heart as he delivered the Lord’s decree. The prophet faced the difficult task of separating his patriotism and empathy for the people from his identity as the Lord’s messenger.\n\n
9:11	idm92900					 The Lord clearly spoke these words, counterbalancing the deep emotion of *9:10* with a further declaration of judgment.\n\n
9:12	idm92907					 It is unclear who asks these three questions. It might be the people or Jeremiah. The first two questions express frustration that the Lord’s message about the religious and political situation made no sense—the Lord’s words seemed too harsh and too extreme. The third question reveals anger that the land had been desolated. The questioner seems to ask where to find the wisdom and goodness of the Lord in what was happening.\n\n
9:13	idm92913					 The Lord answered the questions (*9:12*) by repeating what he had said before. The people caused the destruction of city, towns, and land. They rejected the Lord’s covenant instructions and deliberately disobeyed his commands. They became dedicated idol worshipers because **their ancestors taught them** to worship **images of Baal***,* the Canaanite god of storm and fertility.\n\n
9:15	idm92923					 **The** Lord** . . . the God of Israel** then issued another decree. The Lord would provide **bitterness** and **poison** in the form of exile and widespread death in unknown countries.\n\n
9:17	idm92934					 This series of four short poems and a brief prose passage are messages from the Lord, presumably delivered to the people of Judah by Jeremiah. Three of the poems describe the effects of the Lord’s judgment on the people; the fourth poem is an exhortation. The prose section predicts doom on Judah and her neighboring nations.\n\n
9:17	idm92940					 The Lord commanded the people to organize the professional **mourners***;* these individuals commonly performed at ancient Near Eastern **funerals** (see *Amos 5:16*; *Mark 5:38*).\n\n
9:18	idm92951					 The mourners had to start their work immediately, mourning those who had already died and grieving for doomed Jerusalem. The mourners were to join the **people of Jerusalem** who had no **homes** and were forced to flee as refugees.\n\n
9:20	idm92959					 Because of the many deaths in the city, not enough professional mourners were available. The **women** were urged to quickly **teach** their **daughters** to be skilled mourners.\n\n
9:23	idm92968					 This short poem discusses the nature of true wisdom.\n\n
9:23	idm92974					 Intellectuals might **boast** about the knowledge they have accumulated. The king and his royal court might flaunt their **power** with pomp and ceremony. Wealthy merchants might display **their riches** by wearing splendid clothes and constructing majestic buildings. All of these would be destroyed at the time of God’s judgment.\n\n
9:24	idm92983					 The Lord would recognize just one kind of **boast**—the testimony of persons who **truly know** and **understand** that **the** Lord is the one true God (*1 Cor 1:31*; *2 Cor 10:17*). • **unfailing love:** This key covenant term (Hebrew *khesed*) carries the basic meaning of passionate loyalty. It is often undeserved, and the word may be translated as “mercy,” “grace,” “kindness,” or **love**. It is the Old Testament equivalent of the New Testament affirmation that “God is love” (*1 Jn 4:8*). • **righteousness:** God deals with his people on an ethical, moral level. He does what is right in every situation. • **I delight in these things:** God does not find joy in bringing vicious sinners to judgment and then punishing them. Rather, he actively seeks to redeem sinners.\n\n
9:25	idm93002					 Because arrogant sin ruled the nation, there would soon come a **time** when the Lord would decree a sentence of doom. • The rite of circumcision among the Hebrew people went back to Abraham (*Gen 17:10-14*). Through the centuries, this rite became so closely associated with being God’s covenant people that the Israelites assumed that it guaranteed their nation a lasting relationship with the Lord. Being **circumcised in body** is not enough, however; a person must also be **circumcised . . . in spirit**—radically separated from idol worship and completely committed to placing **the** Lord at the center of life and practice (*Rom 2:25-29*).\n\n
9:26	idm93015					 The **Egyptians** lived to the southwest on both sides of the Nile River. The **Edomites** lived to the south and southeast of Judah. The **Ammonites** lived east of the Jordan River. The **Moabites** lived east of the Dead Sea. These nations practiced circumcision but had **uncircumcised hearts** because all of them worshiped many false deities.\n\n
10:1	idm93026					 This poetic passage has three parts. The first is a contrast between the Lord and pagan idols (*10:1-16*). The second is a two-part reflection on the destruction that lay ahead for the idol worshipers (*10:17-18*, *19-22*). The third part is a prayer for God to act with restraint in the coming judgment and not to allow the pagan nations to go unpunished (*10:23-25*).\n\n
10:1	idm93036					 This poetic passage severely criticizes idol worship and strongly affirms the unity and majesty of the one true God. It is neither a rational discussion of divinity in nature nor a carefully crafted statement about God’s attributes; rather, it is a poem about the foolishness of worshiping idols that the worshipers themselves have made, along with vigorous affirmations of faith that boldly declare who God is.\n\n
10:1	idm93042					 As usual, Jeremiah identified the source of his message and urged his audience not simply to **hear***,* but to pay careful attention to the **word** of **the** Lord. In Hebrew thought, the person who does not respond has not truly heard.\n\n
10:2	idm93053					 The Lord commanded Israel (particularly Judah, because it was all that remained of Israel) to **act** differently from **other nations**. He warned them to reject certain people, such as astrologers who claim to **read their future in the stars**.\n\n
10:3	idm93062					 The stars are unable to predict anything—only the Lord knows the future. • A wooden **idol** was carved from **a tree***;* a **craftsman** carved the wood until it looked something like a creature that lives on earth (*Isa 40:18-20*; *44:9-20*).\n\n
10:4	idm93074					 The carved image possessed no beauty or value of its own. Humans had to apply **gold and silver** to make it look impressive (see *10:9*). Similarly, the image had no strength to stand by itself. It had to be secured to a foundation **with hammer and nails**.\n\n
10:5	idm93083					 Just as **scarecrows** in a garden can do nothing more than scare ignorant birds, idols are feared only by ignorant people.\n\n
10:6	idm93090					 **there is no one like you!** See *Isa 40:21-31*; *44:5-8*.\n\n
10:7	idm93099					 The **fear** of the Lord is not craven terror, but profound reverence and submission to his discipline (*Job 28:28*; *Ps 34:11-14*; *Prov 1:7*). It results in contentment (*Prov 10:23*). • **King of nations:** God is not limited to being the Lord of one small nation; his reign is worldwide. Jeremiah pointed out that no man-made deity could ever claim that title; not even **wise people** deserve such reverence.\n\n
10:9	idm93112					 The people who created idols had to send far away for metal. They had to purchase **silver from Tarshish** on the southern tip of Spain. They had to buy **gold from Uphaz** (or *Ophir*) in Arabia. The **skillful craftsmen** and **expert tailors** put their best efforts into changing an otherwise worthless piece of wood or stone into an attractive artifact (see *10:4-5*).\n\n
10:10	idm93124					 Pagan deities are neither alive nor permanent. They can easily be destroyed or put in museums. Mythical stories about idols showed them engaging in all sorts of immoral conduct because the people who invented them wanted to justify their own immorality. The **true God** is holy and just and abhors immoral behavior.\n\n
10:11	idm93131					 The pagan deities were not present at the creation of the **heavens and earth***,* nor are they everlasting. • The original text of this verse is in Aramaic, perhaps indicating that it was a quotation of an Aramaic saying and that this passage was addressed to the exiles in Babylon, where Aramaic was spoken.\n\n
10:12	idm93139					 This stanza contains several strong affirmations of God’s nature.\n\n
10:12	idm93145					 Jeremiah affirmed that the Lord’s **power***,* **wisdom***,* and **understanding** are the attributes with which he creates and sustains creation.\n\n
10:13	idm93156					 This affirmation struck at the essence of Baal, the Canaanite god of storm and fertility. The Canaanites believed that Baal actually was the **thunder** and the **rain***,* but the Lord claimed them as his creations (*Ps 135:5-7*) through which he can speak and even **roar** (*Job 37:2-5*).\n\n
10:16	idm93168					 **the God of Israel:** Literally *the Portion of Jacob.* The Hebrew idiom suggests that God himself is everything the people need. The God of Israel is not to be compared to pagan deities. As **the Creator***,* God selected the people of **Israel***,* rescued them from Egypt, and brought them into Canaan; the Lord redeemed them from slavery to make them his chosen people.\n\n
10:17	idm93180					 An announcement of judgment (*10:17-18*) is followed by a lament over what that judgment would mean (*10:19-22*).\n\n
10:17	idm93188					 This short decree about the coming exile is probably related to the first invasion of Judah by the Babylonians in 605 BC (see *study note on Dan 1:1*); however, it could also have applied to the invasions of 597, 586, or 581 BC, when some of the people of Judah were taken into exile (see *Jer 52:28-30*). • **I will fling out all you:** This expression might include the refugees who fled to nearby countries as well as the exiles taken to Babylon.\n\n
10:19	idm93199					 Jeremiah suffered personal loss along with his people; he spoke for the nation at large as well as for himself.\n\n
10:20	idm93205					 Jeremiah’s beloved **home** community of Anathoth was destroyed; even the town’s **children** were taken into exile. The same was true of the entire nation.\n\n
10:21	idm93213					 The **shepherds** (priests and prophets; see *5:29-31*) had turned their backs on the** wisdom from the** Lord that had been preserved in priestly memory and in the prophetic messages, both verbal and written. The divine decree predicted the utter failure of these leaders, as well as the resultant scattering of the people.\n\n
10:22	idm93223					 The invading **armies** would reduce every town to rubble, and **jackals** (wild dogs) would make their dens in the tumbled ruins.\n\n
10:23	idm93231					 Jeremiah wanted the Lord to **pour out** his **wrath***,* not simply on Judah, but on **the nations** who **devoured your people Israel***;* cp. *Isa 26:9-11*; *Hab 1:17*. These other kingdoms had gone so far in their brutality that the countryside was a **desolate wilderness**. *Jer 10:25* is a quotation from *Ps 79:6-7*.\n\n
11:1	idm93248					 The Lord reminded Jeremiah of several messages (*Exod 19:5*) that had been the basis for the relationship between the Lord and Israel over many centuries. Because the kingdom of Judah was the only remaining portion of the nation of Israel, its people were the defendants in their upcoming trial before the Lord. This event probably occurred during the reign of Jehoiakim.\n\n
11:1	idm93255					 The Lord authorized **Jeremiah** to present the legal charges against **the people of Judah and Jerusalem**. With the power of the divine name behind the spoken words, the Lord brought forward the **terms** of the **covenant** pertaining to the curses that would come upon those who did not **obey** (see *Deut 27:15-26*; *28:15-68*).\n\n
11:4	idm93268					 The Egyptians knew how to smelt iron, but the **iron-smelting furnace of Egypt** was also a metaphor for the Israelites’ slavery in that land from which the Lord had rescued them. God had also promised to be uniquely theirs if they would be uniquely his (*Exod 6:7*).\n\n
11:5	idm93276					 The Lord wanted to give Israel prosperity and blessing. **Milk** implies cattle, sheep, and goats. **Honey***,* the product of bees, implies the presence of many different flowering and fruit-bearing plants. • The word **Amen** is a Hebrew word that can be translated **may it be so.** The NLT includes both the Hebrew word and its translation.\n\n
11:6	idm93287					 Jeremiah was to use every available means to **broadcast** the Lord’s **message** to as many people as he could. As he visited every **town** and walked **the streets of Jerusalem***,* he reminded the people to **remember** and **obey** the requirements of **the ancient covenant**.\n\n
11:8	idm93301					 The Old Testament books of Numbers, Judges, Samuel, and Kings describe how the people of Israel repeatedly violated the **covenant** right up to Jeremiah’s time.\n\n
11:9	idm93308					 **conspiracy:** The word connotes “betrayal” or “treason” (cp. *2 Kgs 11:14*). • **Judah and Jerusalem** would no longer worship the Redeemer God, but would give themselves to **worshiping other gods**. Both **Israel** (probably referring here to the ten northern tribes) and **Judah** had **broken the covenant**.\n\n
11:11	idm93321					 The Lord warned Jeremiah ahead of time about the decree that he would issue against the people. **Calamity** was approaching, and no prayers could prevent it. The time for God’s **mercy** had passed.\n\n
11:12	idm93329					 The **people of Judah and Jerusalem** prayed and worshiped in their time of trouble, but not to the Lord; instead, they prayed **to their idols**. They were bonded to unreal and powerless images of wood and stone instead of to the one true God.\n\n
11:13	idm93337					 Idolatry was so rampant in Judah that not a town or street could be found without an idol present.\n\n
11:14	idm93343					 The Lord told Jeremiah not to **weep or pray** for the people of Jerusalem (see *7:16*); the Lord had shut his ears to any prayers they might direct to him. Because the people were committed to worshiping Baal, any prayer they offered would be a charade.\n\n
11:15	idm93351					 The people’s worship included the words and ceremonies the Lord required, but their worship was insincere; they did not love God or their neighbors.\n\n
11:16	idm93357					 At the time of the Exodus, the Lord regarded Israel as **a thriving olive tree**. King David likened himself to an olive tree (*Ps 52:8*), and the apostle Paul used this image when discussing how Gentiles could partake of the blessings of salvation (*Rom 11:16-21*).\n\n
11:18	idm93366					 The Lord warned Jeremiah of the **plots** against him. Jeremiah prayed, and the Lord promised to rescue him.\n\n
11:18	idm93373					 The Lord had warned Jeremiah at the time of his commissioning (*1:19*) that opposition would threaten his life. Jeremiah saw himself as **a lamb being led to the slaughter***,* with no power to resist. This opposition occurred before Jeremiah’s trial in the Temple courtyard, early in the reign of Jehoiakim (between 608 and 605 BC; see ch *26*). Some scholars believe that this verse prefigures the death of Christ, as does the suffering servant of *Isa 53:7*.\n\n
11:20	idm93385					 Jeremiah wanted the Lord to punish his enemies since the Lord knew their **deepest thoughts and secrets**. As events unfolded, Jeremiah discovered that the Lord had his own way of dealing with his foes.\n\n
11:21	idm93392					 Jeremiah’s enemies even included family and relatives in his hometown of **Anathoth***,* over whose fate he grieved (*10:20*). They demanded that he should **stop prophesying in the** Lord**’s name**. In line with the Lord’s promise to take care of him (*1:19*), the Lord told Jeremiah that even the families of his foes, including **their boys and girls***,* would lose their lives **when their time of punishment** came.\n\n
12:1	idm93408					 Jeremiah wondered why a just God did not immediately punish the wicked. Jeremiah could not stand the continued wickedness, yet he also grieved for the terrible human suffering that he saw coming (*10:19-25*).\n\n
12:1	idm93415					 Jeremiah affirmed the Lord’s **justice** when dealing with him in the past. However, since he was obedient, he could not understand why his life was being threatened. By contrast, those who were **wicked** and **evil** seemed to be **prosperous** and **happy**.\n\n
12:2	idm93426					 Jeremiah was irked that the Lord allowed evil people to become established and enjoy prosperity and happiness.\n\n
12:3	idm93432					 Although Jeremiah’s words seem self-righteous, he was submissive to the Lord’s personal searching of his **heart**. Jeremiah was also angry enough to demand that his enemies suffer the fate they had intended for him. He hoped they would be **butchered** or **slaughtered** like helpless **sheep**. Jeremiah did not seem to desire their forgiveness or their return to the Lord.\n\n
12:4	idm93442					 Jeremiah expressed feelings of helplessness; the Lord’s decree of desolation for the land seemed excessive. Jeremiah did recognize the **evil** of the people’s sneering claim that the Lord could not **see** the future (cp. *Isa 46:10*).\n\n
12:5	idm93452					 The Lord rebuked his messenger and responded to his question with questions of his own.\n\n
12:5	idm93458					 Jeremiah’s **racing against mere men** was the conflict he experienced with his family and friends. It could not be compared to the **race against horses** that would take place when the foreign army arrived. The coming war would be as severe as finding one’s way through the **thickets near the Jordan**.\n\n
12:6	idm93467					 Jeremiah’s **family** was a microcosm of Judah; they would **plot . . . against** Jeremiah behind his back (*11:9*) while speaking **pleasantly** to his face. They wanted to convince him that the Lord would not let the Babylonians harm the people of Judah and Jerusalem, and they hoped to stop him from bringing shame on the family (cp. *Mark 3:21*).\n\n
12:7	idm93478					 God called the people of Judah his **special possession***,* his **dearest ones***,* his **chosen people***,* and his **vineyard**. However, they had become hostile to him, so they had to be **surrendered** to **their enemies**. Perhaps the most severe justice they could face was for the Lord to step back and let the people suffer the consequences of their evil ways.\n\n
12:9	idm93493					 The people of Judah would become prey to huge flocks of **speckled vultures**. The people would soon be **corpses** that **wild animals** would **pick . . . clean**.\n\n
12:10	idm93503					 The corrupt **rulers** of Judah had already desolated the land by leading the people into sin (e.g., *2 Kgs 16:8-19*; *21:16*; *23:33-35*); the invading army would simply complete the task.\n\n
12:10	idm93513					 A **vineyard** is a frequent metaphor for God’s people (e.g., *Isa 5:1-10*; *Matt 21:33-45*; *John 15:1-8*).\n\n
12:11	idm93523					 Sorrow gripped the Lord as he saw the **empty wasteland**. He had ordered the invasion according to the terms of the Sinai covenant, but the act gave him no satisfaction. Sadly, **no one** other than God even cared.\n\n
12:12	idm93531					 The invading **armies** were the **sword** that **the** Lord sent to destroy the land.\n\n
12:13	idm93541					 The Lord found no joy in seeing his people’s crops eaten by invaders, who left only **thorns**. However, the apostasy of the people of Judah merited **the fierce anger of the** Lord (cp. *Ezek 16:36-39*), resulting in **shame**.\n\n
12:14	idm93552					 The Lord explained an important aspect of Jeremiah’s commission (see *1:10*).\n\n
12:14	idm93559					 No **evil nations** would receive protection from God’s punishment, not even those nations that God used to punish Judah. He would **uproot** them. • The Lord would also **uproot Judah,** but this is a positive reference to deliverance from exile.\n\n
12:15	idm93568					 **I will . . . have compassion on all of them:** Even other nations, as wicked as they were, could be restored after experiencing disaster.\n\n
12:16	idm93575					 To experience God’s compassion (*12:15*), the people of other **nations** needed to convert from idolatry and **learn the ways of** God’s **people**. This conversion would require a public submission to the terms of the Sinai covenant that included the words, **as surely as the** Lord** lives**. In addition, they would need to reject any oaths made in **the name of Baal***,* by which they had persuaded Israelites to worship foreign idols.\n\n
12:17	idm93590					 If these nations refused to **obey** the Lord, they would be **uprooted and destroyed** (*1:10*). • **I, the** Lord**, have spoken:** This statement gave God’s declaration the force of a divine decree.\n\n
13:1	idm93602					 The Lord told Jeremiah to act out a parable (see also chs *18*, *19*, *27*; see “*Prophetic Sign Acts*” Theme Note). The parable joined action with words to reinforce and illustrate special aspects of the Lord’s response to Judah’s rebellion. Jeremiah seemed unable to fully grasp the evil consequences of rejecting the Lord’s demand that the people worship him as the one true God. The direct relationship between Jeremiah and the Lord was the framework for this event.\n\n
13:1	idm93612					 God instructed Jeremiah to leave a **linen loincloth** unwashed to symbolize Judah’s unrighteousness (cp. *Isa 64:5*; *Rev 19:8*). This piece of clothing is comparable to modern-day underwear.\n\n
13:3	idm93621					 The **Euphrates River** is 300 miles north of Jerusalem. Jeremiah probably joined a merchant caravan for protection as he walked or rode a donkey for the 600-mile round trip. Jeremiah did not know the purpose of the trip, but he obeyed God’s instructions.\n\n
13:6	idm93628					 The safest time to travel was during the dry season, from June to September. The most likely time for cloth to rot was during the wet season, October to May. • **A long time afterward** was probably between six and ten months.\n\n
13:8	idm93635					 The parable was the Lord’s way of expressing how disgusting **the pride of Judah and Jerusalem** had become and how he was allowing the consequences of sin to take their course.\n\n
13:10	idm93642					 The rotten **loincloth** represented the people of **Judah and Israel***,* whose **wicked** rebellion had corrupted them and made them worthless. • **clings:** The same Hebrew word can be translated “joins” and is used to describe marital faithfulness (*Gen 2:24*). • **my people . . . an honor to my name:** See also *Exod 19:5*, *6*; *Deut 32:10-12*; *Eph 2:7*; *3:10*.\n\n
13:12	idm93660					 **Of course!** The people assumed that the Lord would continue to bless them as he had in the past (*Ps 104:15*; *Prov 9:2-5*). However, the **wine** was not a symbol of blessing; in this case, **drunkenness** symbolized God’s wrath (cp. *Rev 14:10*).\n\n
13:15	idm93672					 Jeremiah pled with the people to **listen** and **not be arrogant***,* but to change their attitude. If they refused to **acknowledge** the Lord as the one true God of Israel, a **terrible darkness** would fall upon the nation.\n\n
13:17	idm93683					 Jeremiah had learned that if the people did not acknowledge the Lord, they would **be led away into exile**. The thought of it filled him with grief.\n\n
13:18	idm93690					 The **king** was probably Jehoiakim’s son Jehoiachin, who was crowned in 597 BC after the death of his father; **his mother** was Nehushta (see *2 Kgs 24:1-9*). Jehoiachin was eighteen years old and reigned for just three months; this message was probably delivered during his short reign. His **glorious crowns** would soon be taken from him by the Babylonians (see *2 Kgs 24:11-16*). The treasures of the Temple and palace would be given to the Babylonians, and the royalty and elite of **Judah** would be **carried into exile**. At the same time, Judah’s southern neighbors would take over the **towns of the Negev***,* the desert area from the city of Beersheba to the Gulf of Aqaba.\n\n
13:20	idm93706					 King Jehoiachin did not seem concerned about the well-being of his **beautiful flock***,* the people of Judah. Judah suffered abuse at the hands of its supposed **allies** as a result of the king’s **many sins**.\n\n
13:23	idm93716					 **an Ethiopian:** People have no choice about the **color** of their **skin***,* just as **a leopard** has no choice about being spotted. In the same way, God’s people were born trapped by **evil**. They had no ability to change on their own, and they refused to allow the Lord to change them.\n\n
13:24	idm93728					 The divine Judge decreed condemnation.\n\n
13:24	idm93734					 **I will scatter you like chaff:** This word-picture represented the exile of the people of Judah. Cp. *Ps 1:4-5*.\n\n
13:25	idm93742					 The people of Judah could not escape their **assigned** punishment. They had **forgotten** God and had turned to **false gods**.\n\n
13:26	idm93751					 God allowed the Babylonians to **strip** Judah of all its treasures and take the people captive.\n\n
13:27	idm93758					 Judah’s **idol worship** included ritual sex acts **in the fields and on the hills**. The Lord wanted his people to be spiritually and sexually **pure** in relation to him.\n\n
14:1	idm93767					 This chapter is a three-way conversation among the Lord, Jeremiah, and the people. It was sparked by a serious drought that affected the land.\n\n
14:2	idm93773					 During a drought, no crops were sold in the markets at the Jerusalem **gates**. Previous harvests could not be stored long, so starvation threatened the people. Cisterns constructed to collect water dried up, and with no rain, no water was available for drinking or for cooking meals. As a result, **a great cry** went up from **Jerusalem**.\n\n
14:4	idm93782					 Both people and animals were helpless in the drought. • The **farmers** would **cover their heads** with coarse burlap to express shame, humiliation, and mourning.\n\n
14:7	idm93790					 Although the people confessed their sins, they did not turn from their **wickedness**. They tried to manipulate God into helping them by questioning his love, wisdom, and power, while still claiming the special privilege of being his people.\n\n
14:10	idm93797					 The Lord’s answer to their self-serving prayer cut to the heart of the issue. Their status as God’s **people** had been destroyed by their **wickedness***,* so their prayer was absurd and God’s judgment would proceed.\n\n
14:11	idm93806					 For the third time (see *7:16*; *11:14*), God told Jeremiah not to pray for the people of Judah and Jerusalem. It would be pointless for the people to **fast***,* since the Lord had decided to **pay no attention**. The priests’ presentation of **burnt offerings and grain offerings***,* which the Lord had given Moses as a way of worshiping him (see *Lev 1–2*), would be wasted effort, because the Lord would **not accept them**. Instead, the Lord would respond with **war, famine, and disease**.\n\n
14:13	idm93822					 **their prophets:** The government of Judah supported a corps of prophets who promoted the religious views of the king and his advisers. The Lord often condemned them, along with the officials and the priests. Here, the Lord exposed them as impostors and described what would happen to them and to the people to whom they prophesied.\n\n
14:17	idm93829					 As he surveyed Judah’s condition, God vividly expressed his grief through a short poem. The Lord takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked (*Ezek 18:23*; *33:11*).\n\n
14:19	idm93837					 Despite the Lord’s command to the contrary (*14:11*), Jeremiah prayed for God to mitigate the disaster that was occurring and the greater disaster to come.\n\n
14:22	idm93844					 Worship of other **gods** is useless. Only the Creator of the universe has the power to make nature do his bidding.\n\n
15:1	idm93851					 The Lord’s reply to Jeremiah’s prayer (*14:19-22*) was that Judah’s destruction was inevitable.\n\n
15:1	idm93858					 **Moses and Samuel** were noted for their intercessory prayer. Several times, when they prayed for the rebellious Israelites, the Lord withdrew his threatened punishment (see *Exod 32:11-14*; *Num 14:13-20*; *1 Sam 7:8-10*). But now, even their intervention would have been ineffective.\n\n
15:2	idm93868					 The people had no place to **go** to escape **death . . . war . . . famine***,* and **captivity**.\n\n
15:4	idm93878					 Judah’s apostasy could be traced back to **Manasseh son of Hezekiah***,* the king who reigned 697–642 BC (see *2 Kgs 21:1-18*; *2 Chr 33:1-20*).\n\n
15:5	idm93889					 These three questions are rhetorical—the answer is, “No one!”\n\n
15:6	idm93895					 The people had heard the charge that they had **abandoned** God and **turned** their **back on** him before (*2:13*), but they had not taken it seriously. Though the Lord had often given them **another chance** to repent, their sin provoked him to carry out the curses of the Sinai covenant (*Deut 27:15-26*).\n\n
15:8	idm93907					 Both the old and the **young men** would die.\n\n
15:10	idm93914					 Jeremiah bared his heart to God over the unjust treatment he was receiving because he was delivering the Lord’s message. In response, the Lord promised to protect and care for his prophet.\n\n
15:10	idm93920					 Feelings of grief gripped Jeremiah when people **hated** and cursed him for no reason.\n\n
15:11	idm93927					 The Lord replied to Jeremiah’s lament with reassurance and then explained what would be happening soon.\n\n
15:11	idm93933					 When **trouble and distress** fell upon the people, they would ask **Jeremiah** to **plead on their behalf**.\n\n
15:12	idm93942					 **Iron** and **bronze** are metaphors for the strong resolve that the Lord would give to Jeremiah (*1:18*).\n\n
15:13	idm93951					 It is not clear whether the Lord was speaking of Jeremiah’s or of Judah’s future. If Jeremiah’s, this prediction was fulfilled after the fall of Jerusalem (586 BC), when Jeremiah and Baruch were taken to Egypt against their will (see chs *41–44*). If it refers to Judah’s future, the prediction was fulfilled in the fall of Jerusalem and the Exile.\n\n
15:15	idm93959					 Jeremiah’s prayer sheds light on a crucial moment in his relationship with the Lord, when persecution had shattered his strength. It is possible that Jeremiah had begun to let his thinking be influenced by the rebellious people of Judah.\n\n
15:16	idm93965					 Jeremiah was glad to declare God’s word, even though it meant that he could not participate in the **merry feasts** of his sinful people. He protested the apparent injustice he had suffered (*15:18*).\n\n
15:18	idm93973					 Jeremiah posed two rhetorical questions that seem to presuppose that he should not have to suffer.\n\n
15:19	idm93979					 The Lord confronted Jeremiah with the need to make a decision. If Jeremiah decided to **return** to a disposition of service and submission, the Lord would **restore** him to further usefulness. If Jeremiah took care to utter **good words** of submission, faith, and obedience, and reject **worthless ones** (such as those that the false prophets spoke, *14:14-16*), Jeremiah could continue to be the Lord’s **spokesman**.\n\n
15:20	idm93991					 The Lord reaffirmed the promises he had made to Jeremiah when he called him to be a prophet (see *1:18-19*).\n\n
16:1	idm93998					 Jeremiah’s life was to be a sign or a parable (see “*Prophetic Sign Acts*” Theme Note), as the Lord instructed him not to marry (*Jer 16:1-4*) and not to go to funerals (*16:5-7*) or celebrations (*16:8-9*).\n\n
16:1	idm94008					 In Hebrew society, bachelors were rare and males were expected to **get married** in their early twenties. However, the severe crisis of the time apparently required Jeremiah to be a divine messenger without family obligations. He needed to depend entirely on the Lord (cp. *1 Cor 7:26-35*).\n\n
16:3	idm94016					 Jeremiah’s lack of children was the basis for a lesson about the future. The time would soon come when so many **children** and parents would die that no one would remain to **mourn for them or bury them**.\n\n
16:5	idm94024					 The ban on **funerals** and mourning was a parable with a message to the people of Judah. Destruction would be so great and widespread that **no one** would **mourn** properly or **comfort** others.\n\n
16:8	idm94034					 The ban on attending **feasts and parties** isolated Jeremiah from meaningful social contact, but the Lord gave it special importance. The entire nation and its social interaction would soon cease to exist.\n\n
16:10	idm94041					 The Lord told Jeremiah to expect questions from the people that would express their self-righteousness and their belief that the Lord should never harm them.\n\n
16:11	idm94047					 Jeremiah’s reply was the message he received when he was commissioned: The people had **abandoned** the Lord for idols (ch *2*), so the Lord would abandon them.\n\n
16:14	idm94055					 Jeremiah’s message was two-pronged: Judgment does not erase eventual hope (*16:14-15*), but neither does hope cancel out the certainty of judgment (*16:16-18*).\n\n
16:14	idm94063					 The Lord planned to bring his people back from exile to the Promised Land, an event that would be on par with the exodus from Egypt (see *Ezra 1–6*). The Exodus was the primary event in Israel’s history that had demonstrated the reality and power of the one true God.\n\n
16:16	idm94070					 The **fishermen** and **hunters** were the Babylonian soldiers God used to mete out his judgment (cp. *Hab 1:14-16*).\n\n
16:18	idm94079					 The **punishment** was **double**—slaughter and exile—because the people of Judah had violated the two most important commandments. They did not love God (*Deut 6:4-5*), and they did not love their neighbors (*Lev 19:18*; see also *Matt 22:37-40*).\n\n
16:19	idm94090					 Jeremiah responded by worshiping the Lord for his protection in times of **trouble** and his provision of salvation for people **from around the world**.\n\n
16:21	idm94098					 The Lord will require all people to know his **power** and **might** and to **understand** that he is **the** Lord (cp. *Exod 6:7*; *8:22*).\n\n
17:1	idm94111					 The families of Judah were committed to Baal worship; once again, the Lord listed the sins that justified their judgment.\n\n
17:1	idm94117					 A stone mason used **an iron chisel** or **a diamond point** to permanently inscribe images and texts on stones. Idol worship had so hardened the thoughts, emotions, and will of the people that it seemed impossible for them to change. • In Old Testament times, **the corners of . . . altars** had projections called “horns” (e.g., *Exod 27:1-2*). According to covenant rules, when an animal sacrifice was offered, blood was applied to these horns. How Baal worshipers treated them is unknown.\n\n
17:2	idm94127					 **Asherah poles** were cut from trees and erected near altars dedicated to Baal, the Canaanite storm god. **Asherah** was the Canaanite goddess who symbolized the fertility of moist ground that could produce crops. Ritual sex was performed near these altars to cause rain to fall, seeds to sprout, and plants to grow. A **tree** growing near an altar could also represent this fertility goddess. The people of Judah were so depraved that parents encouraged their **children** to join them in these rituals.\n\n
17:3	idm94137					 The Lord’s **holy mountain** was the Temple Mount in Jerusalem; **wealth and treasures** were stored there.\n\n
17:4	idm94145					 **The wonderful possession***,* the Promised Land, would **slip from** Judah’s **hands** when the people were taken **as captives to** Babylon.\n\n
17:5	idm94156					 This meditation on the folly of trusting in humans is contrasted with the wisdom of trusting in the Lord.\n\n
17:5	idm94162					 **Trust** is the disposition of the heart that results in obedience (cp. *11:4*; *Deut 27:15-26*).\n\n
17:6	idm94171					 The people of Judah would be utterly helpless in the time of calamity because they had switched their trust from the Lord to human capabilities. The people of Judah would be just like **shrubs in the desert** that are **stunted** because they lack water.\n\n
17:7	idm94179					 **Those who trust in the** Lord*,* like **trees planted along a riverbank***,* will have abundant resources and be well prepared to meet the vicissitudes of life. • **Water** represents the law of the Lord (cp. *Ps 1*; *Ezek 47:1-12*; *Rev 2:1-2*).\n\n
17:9	idm94194					 By nature, the **human heart** is **deceitful** and **desperately wicked**. Only the Lord **really knows how bad it is**.\n\n
17:11	idm94204					 Jeremiah affirmed that he had learned this lesson and did indeed trust in the Lord.\n\n
17:11	idm94210					 Jeremiah commended the Lord’s faithfulness to his people, in contrast to the fate awaiting those who turned away from the Lord.\n\n
17:11	idm94216					 Jeremiah cited a general principle (cp. *Ps 73*) that was not necessarily universal (*Job 21:27-33*): Those who have gained **wealth by unjust means** eventually lose those riches.\n\n
17:12	idm94225					 God’s faithful people **worship** the sovereign Lord, not money.\n\n
17:14	idm94232					 Jeremiah asked that since he had been faithful to the Lord, the Lord would rescue him from his persecutors and give him healing, salvation, and vindication.\n\n
17:14	idm94238					 Only the Lord can **heal** and **save***,* so **praises** are due to him **alone**.\n\n
17:15	idm94249					 Jeremiah’s predictions had not yet come true, so the people treated him with scorn; they might have even called him a false prophet (cp. *Deut 18:21-22*).\n\n
17:16	idm94256					 Because he was faithful, Jeremiah appealed to the Lord for vindication.\n\n
17:17	idm94262					 Jeremiah had a natural fear of the coming national **disaster***,* so he turned to the Lord for protection.\n\n
17:18	idm94270					 Jeremiah wanted his persecutors to experience the **shame and dismay** they deserved, the very feelings that he was experiencing (*17:15*).\n\n
17:19	idm94278					 Motivated by greed, the people of **Jerusalem** were violating the sanctity of the **Sabbath day** (see *Exod 20:8-11*; *Deut 5:12-15*). If they observed the Sabbath, they would lose income from trade. The Lord spelled out the reasons why they should keep the Sabbath **holy**.\n\n
17:19	idm94289					 The Lord instructed Jeremiah to go from gate to gate where business was transacted and confront the offenders face to face, beginning with **the king**.\n\n
17:21	idm94296					 Trading on **the Sabbath** was wrong and had to be stopped. The Sabbath was not a time to buy and sell, but was established in the Sinai covenant as **a holy day** (*Exod 29:8-11*; *31:12-17*) when the people of Israel were to rest and honor the Lord.\n\n
17:23	idm94306					 **they did not listen or obey:** The people probably considered the Sabbath too costly to observe, so they ignored it or overlooked its violations.\n\n
17:24	idm94313					 The Lord was willing to give the people a chance to change their ways. By choosing to **obey** God, the people could enjoy unending peace and the continuation of the kingdom and the city of **Jerusalem**. • The promise of **chariots** and **horses** represented the Lord’s blessing.\n\n
17:26	idm94323					 If the people repented, the Lord’s blessings would extend to the **towns of Judah and Benjamin**. • **The western foothills** stretched north and south between the coastal plain of the Mediterranean Sea and the **hill country***,* where Jerusalem rested. • The **Negev** was the desert that stretched from Beersheba southward to the Gulf of Aqaba. People from all these areas would come with their offerings to worship the Lord in his **Temple**.\n\n
17:27	idm94335					 **I will set fire to these gates:** This event occurred in 586 BC (*2 Kgs 25:9*).\n\n
18:1	idm94344					 The Lord had Jeremiah take part in an object lesson. What Jeremiah observed at **the potter’s shop** became a picture of what the Lord was about to do with Judah.\n\n
18:1	idm94351					 Jeremiah watched as the potter formed an earthen jar, then crushed it and started over.\n\n
18:5	idm94357					 The Lord likened himself to **this potter**. He could set standards of perfection and choose to destroy or reshape his work.\n\n
18:7	idm94364					 If a **nation or kingdom** rejected the one true God, then God could decree that it **be uprooted, torn down, and destroyed** (cp. *1:10*). If the nation changed **its evil ways***,* the Lord’s anger would relent and he would **not destroy** it.\n\n
18:11	idm94376					 The Lord planned to deal with **Judah and Jerusalem** as the potter dealt with the clay (*18:4*). However, they could still escape **disaster** if they would reject their **evil ways** and **do what is right**.\n\n
18:12	idm94387					 Instead of heeding the Lord’s message, **the people** of Judah ridiculed it, refused to change, and made a brazen commitment to pursue their **own evil desires**.\n\n
18:13	idm94395					 The Lord answered that he would scatter his people who had deserted him.\n\n
18:13	idm94401					 **Has anyone ever heard of such a thing?** In other **nations**, people did not turn their backs on their national deities (*2:11-13*), but **Israel** blatantly mocked the one true God.\n\n
18:14	idm94411					 The answer to these two rhetorical questions was “No.” The snow and the streams of **the mountaintops of Lebanon** were perennially reliable. By contrast, the Lord’s people were **not so reliable**. • **The ancient highways** represented a life of faithfulness to the covenant (*6:16*), while the **muddy paths** symbolized a life of self-serving paganism.\n\n
18:16	idm94422					 The Lord pronounced sentence on Judah and Jerusalem. • **their land will become desolate . . . I will scatter my people:** In 605–586 BC, Judah and Jerusalem were progressively emptied of residents. • **as the east wind scatters dust:** During the summer, a strong hot wind from the east can blow sand and dust from the desert into Judah. • **I will turn my back on them:** The people would no longer experience a covenant relationship with the Lord.\n\n
18:18	idm94432					 Jeremiah made an impassioned plea for vengeance on those who were trying to subvert his ministry.\n\n
18:18	idm94438					 The people hated **Jeremiah** because his authoritative messages challenged the messages of their leaders, so they plotted **to stop** him.\n\n
18:19	idm94446					 Jeremiah reminded the Lord of the injustice of his enemies’ opposition.\n\n
18:21	idm94452					 In his prayer for vengeance, Jeremiah asked God to fulfill his promised curses against those who violated his covenant (cp. *Deut 27:11-26*; *28:15-68*; see also “*Prayers for Vengeance*” Theme Note).\n\n
19:1	idm94461					 Jeremiah acted out another parable (see *13:1-14*) that demonstrated to the leaders of Judah that the Lord would utterly destroy their idolatrous and murderous nation.\n\n
19:4	idm94468					 **The people burn incense:** According to the Sinai covenant, offering incense while worshiping the Lord was to be an act of the priests (*Exod 30:8*). Offering incense to idols was a terrible affront to the Lord. • **the blood of innocent children:** Child sacrifice was practiced in Baal worship, and sometimes by **the kings of Judah** (*2 Kgs 17:17*; *Ps 106:37-38*).\n\n
19:6	idm94480					 **Valley of Slaughter:** Cp. *7:32*.\n\n
19:9	idm94488					 The **siege** of Jerusalem lasted for two and a half years, resulting in severe famine and **despair** (see *2 Kgs 25:1-4*). • **their own sons and daughters:** Cp. *Deut 28:53-57*.\n\n
19:10	idm94499					 **Judah***,* the nation that these leaders represented, would be utterly **shattered** and broken **beyond all hope of repair**. Never again would Judah be a sovereign nation with a Davidic king (see *33:17-18*), and the city of Jerusalem would be **defiled like Topheth***,* the unclean valley (see *study note on 7:30-34*).\n\n
19:14	idm94513					 Jeremiah concluded his message at **the Temple of the** Lord*,* where the common people could hear him.\n\n
20:1	idm94522					 The persecution suffered by **Jeremiah** moved from words to action. Jeremiah was **whipped** and placed **in stocks** overnight on the charge that he had blasphemed **the Temple**. When he was released, Jeremiah gave his jailer a message of personal condemnation from the Lord.\n\n
20:1	idm94532					 **Pashhur***,* the head of the police who kept order in **the Temple** area, ranked second to the high priest in authority. Evidently, he had heard **Jeremiah** proclaim the Lord’s decree about the destruction of Jerusalem, including the Temple. He regarded it as such blasphemy that he thought Jeremiah should be punished.\n\n
20:3	idm94542					 **The Man Who Lives in Terror:** Cp. *46:5*; *Ps 31:13*.\n\n
20:4	idm94551					 This is the first instance in which Jeremiah names **Babylon** as the country whose armies would invade **Judah** and take the people into exile. The invaders would take the **precious jewels and gold and silver***,* leaving Judah without resources.\n\n
20:6	idm94561					 **Pashhur** would be confronted with the proof that he had been a false prophet.\n\n
20:7	idm94568					 **you misled me:** Jeremiah spoke of his calling from the Lord (*1:5-10*) using the same Hebrew word that elsewhere refers to sexual seduction (*Exod 22:16*).\n\n
20:8	idm94577					 Jeremiah found it impossible not to speak **the words** of God’s judgment, even though his **messages** turned him into **a household joke** (cp. *Job 32:18-20*; *Ps 39:1-3*; *Acts 4:18-20*).\n\n
20:10	idm94589					 The people sarcastically threw back on Jeremiah the name that he had given to Pashhur, **The Man Who Lives in Terror** (*20:3*). Even Jeremiah’s **old friends** looked for ways to twist his words and trip him up.\n\n
20:11	idm94598					 Jeremiah realized that God was **like a great warrior** standing at his side. Jeremiah’s **persecutors** were at a real disadvantage and would completely **fail**.\n\n
20:12	idm94607					 Jeremiah placed his complete trust in the Lord** of Heaven’s Armies** (see *5:14*), who alone could carry out the **vengeance** due to the prophet’s enemies.\n\n
20:13	idm94617					 Suddenly, relief and joy came to Jeremiah’s soul; he recalled that even when he was **poor and needy***,* the Lord had **rescued** him from his **oppressors**.\n\n
20:14	idm94627					 Jeremiah’s hope of deliverance did not negate the reality of his circumstances. Shocked by his persecution, Jeremiah wished that he were already dead or that he had never been born (cp. *16:3-4*; *Job 3*).\n\n
20:16	idm94635					 The **cities of old** were probably Sodom and Gomorrah (*Gen 19:24-29*).\n\n
20:17	idm94643					 Jeremiah saw no meaning to his **life**.\n\n
21:1	idm94650					 From this point forward in the book of Jeremiah, there is specific information about the last several kings of Judah, particularly Jehoiakim and Zedekiah. The narratives are mostly written in prose and are not always in exact chronological sequence.\n\n
21:1	idm94656					 This section moves to the beginning of the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem in 588 BC (cp. *52:1-23*; *2 Kgs 24:18–25:21*; *2 Chr 36:11-21*). The Lord communicated with Judah through his messenger Jeremiah.\n\n
21:1	idm94666					 The reign of **King Zedekiah** spanned 597–586 BC. • The **Pashhur** mentioned here is not the one mentioned in *20:1-6* because they had different fathers. He and **Zephaniah** bore the full authority of the king, yet when they met the prophet, **they begged Jeremiah** for the Lord’s help. Clearly, they regarded Jeremiah as a man of great authority. Zedekiah recognized Jeremiah’s prophetic authority, but he lacked the courage or the moral integrity to do what Jeremiah directed him to do in the Lord’s name.\n\n
21:2	idm94678					 **Nebuchadnezzar . . . is attacking Judah:** This event probably occurred around the beginning of the siege of Jerusalem in 588 BC (*2 Kgs 25:1*). • Zedekiah did not pray to the Lord as his ancestor Hezekiah had done (*2 Kgs 19:14-20*, *29-37*; *2 Chr 32:20-22*; *Isa 37:1-7*, *14-20*). However, the king expected Jeremiah to perform the miracle of turning away the Lord’s anger.\n\n
21:3	idm94692					 The Lord answered King Zedekiah’s messengers with a judicial decree (see *study note on 2:2*). Resisting the Babylonians would be **useless** because the Lord was fighting against Jerusalem.\n\n
21:8	idm94700					 Although the Lord had decided to destroy the city of **Jerusalem** regardless, individual **people** still had a **choice** between **life***,* probably as slaves in Babylon, or **death** by Babylonian swords (cp. *Deut 20:10-13*).\n\n
21:11	idm94713					 Far from performing a miracle for the **dynasty of David,** God was going to hold them accountable for their sins.\n\n
21:11	idm94720					 The Lord gave the **royal family of Judah** the choice of treating **the people** with **justice** or facing the Lord’s **anger**.\n\n
21:13	idm94730					 The **people in Jerusalem** had put their complete faith in the **mighty fortress** of the city, believing it could not be conquered (see *2 Kgs 18:35-37*; *2 Chr 32:20-23*; *Isa 37:36-38*). The Lord had protected the city in the past, but now the Lord was fighting against it. • **light a fire in your forests:** See *Isa 6:13*.\n\n
22:1	idm94743					 This collection of messages to the last Davidic kings of Judah culminates in the promise that God would one day place a true descendant of David over his people.\n\n
22:1	idm94749					 Jeremiah delivered a statement, drawn from the Sinai covenant, that summarized the duties of a king of Judah. Fulfillment of these duties would ensure the continuation of the dynasty of David in Jerusalem; refusal would bring the unimaginable disappearance of the palace and the kingdom.\n\n
22:3	idm94755					 The **evil deeds** of Judah’s leaders included not being **right** or **fair-minded and just**. They had also refused to **help those** who had been **robbed** or to **rescue** the oppressed, and they mistreated **foreigners, orphans, and widows** (see *Isa 58:6-7*; *Mic 6:8*; *Zech 7:9-10*; *8:16-17*; *Matt 23:23*).\n\n
22:6	idm94773					 After the Temple, **Judah’s royal palace** was the nation’s most important building. It was an expensive building produced by the best craftsmen (*1 Kgs 7:1-12*), and it was the king’s home and the center of his government. Although the Lord loved the palace, it would not escape the destruction he decreed for Jerusalem.\n\n
22:6	idm94781					 Valuable crops were raised in the valleys and on the slopes of **Gilead***,* the highlands rising eastward from the Jordan Valley. • **Lebanon** was the area north of Israel along the seacoast, including the high mountain ridge on the country’s eastern side. It was famous for its stately **cedar** trees.\n\n
22:8	idm94791					 The ruin of Jerusalem would proclaim to other **nations** the consequences of Judah’s violation of **their covenant with the** Lord** their God**.\n\n
22:10	idm94801					 This section contains a series of severe indictments against the descendants of Josiah.\n\n
22:10	idm94807					 The **dead king** was Josiah, who was killed by the Egyptians at the Battle of Megiddo in 609 BC. The people of Judah were not to **weep** or **mourn** his death. Their sorrow should center on Josiah’s son, whom they had chosen as the new king. After three months, King **Jehoahaz** was taken into exile in Egypt, where he spent the rest of his life (*2 Kgs 23:1-33*; *2 Chr 36:1-8*).\n\n
22:13	idm94820					 Egypt placed another of Josiah’s sons, Eliakim, on the throne in Jerusalem. His name was changed to **Jehoiakim**. Most of the material in chs *7–20* was probably written during Jehoiakim’s reign (609–598 BC). The Lord indicted him because of his faithlessness and greed, brought him to trial, declared him guilty, and pronounced the death penalty against him.\n\n
22:13	idm94829					 Because **Jehoiakim** forced poor men to work as slaves with no pay, his building projects had **injustice** built into their **walls**.\n\n
22:14	idm94838					 **a magnificent palace:** Archaeologists have unearthed the foundations of what is believed to be this palace three miles south of Jerusalem. The foundations indicate that the building had **huge rooms**.\n\n
22:15	idm94846					 If Jehoiakim wanted **plenty to eat and drink***,* he did not have to resort to corruption and oppression. Compared with his prosperous **father, Josiah***,* Jehoiakim was not **a great king**. Josiah, by contrast, had been **just and right in all his dealings***,* a servant of God and his people. Because he had lived up to the requirements of the ancient covenant, **God blessed him**.\n\n
22:17	idm94860					 Unlike his father, Josiah, Jehoiakim practiced **greed and dishonesty** and ignored the requirements of the covenant.\n\n
22:18	idm94867					 God delivered his verdict against Jehoiakim’s terrible sins. Neither his family nor **his subjects** would **mourn for him**.\n\n
22:19	idm94875					 Jehoiakim died in disgrace (see *study note on 2 Kgs 24:6*).\n\n
22:20	idm94882					 Jehoiakim might have believed that the nation’s close neighbors, including **Lebanon** and **Bashan***,* would support him in a time of crisis. They could not, because the Babylonians had already **destroyed** them. • **Bashan** was **in the regions east of the** Jordan **river**.\n\n
22:22	idm94895					 The days of prosperity were gone, and chaos enveloped Judah. Like a **wind** sweeping through the land, the Babylonians would defeat Judah’s allies and take many **captives**. • **Surely then you will see:** Royal self-delusions would be swept aside and the consequences of **wickedness** would cause the king to be **ashamed**.\n\n
22:24	idm94906					 **Jehoiachin***,* the **son of Jehoiakim***,* came to the throne at the age of eighteen in 597 BC. The Babylonians attacked Jerusalem because of his father’s rebellion against **Nebuchadnezzar**. After only three months on the throne, Jehoiachin had sense enough to surrender, and he was taken captive to **Babylon** (*2 Kgs 24:8-14*), along with most of the royal family.\n\n
22:25	idm94920					 Young king Jehoiachin was **desperately** afraid that the Babylonians would kill him, but instead they took him into exile.\n\n
22:28	idm94927					 This poem, a taunt directed at Jehoiachin, included two rhetorical questions with the expected answer, “I don’t know.” However, Jehoiachin’s sins and those of his forefathers were the reasons for his fate. Still, the people of Jerusalem seemed unwilling to accept the justice of his exile.\n\n
22:29	idm94933					 **O earth:** Faithful nature is called as a witness in God’s case against his faithless people (see also *6:19*; *Deut 30:19*; *Isa 1:2*).\n\n
22:30	idm94943					 Although **Jehoiachin** had seven sons (see *1 Chr 3:17*), he was called **childless** because none of them ever sat on the **throne** of **Judah**. His uncle Zedekiah later reigned as king of Judah, but many Israelites regarded Jehoiachin as the last legitimate king of David’s dynasty (see *study note on Ezek 1:2*).\n\n
23:1	idm94955					 The Lord rebuked the three kings (ch *22*) and contrasted them with the righteous leader he would place over his people after the Exile.\n\n
23:1	idm94962					 Kings in the ancient Near East were often referred to as **shepherds**. Good shepherds would protect and **care for** their people, but Judah’s kings **scattered** their people instead.\n\n
23:3	idm94971					 As a good shepherd, the Lord would gather the exiles and place them in **their own sheepfold***,* the land of Judah. There, they would be **fruitful and increase in number** (cp. *Gen 1:28*; *17:6-8*).\n\n
23:4	idm94982					 Once the people were back in Judah (*23:3*), the Lord would **appoint responsible shepherds**. As good leaders, they would **care for** the people.\n\n
23:5	idm94991					 **A righteous descendant** of **King David’s line***,* whose ruling power had temporarily come to an end, would **be a King**. In stark contrast to the three kings the Lord had just rebuked (ch *22*), this King would have **wisdom** and act in a way that **is just and right** (*33:15*; *Isa 11:1-5*; *53:2*; *Zech 3:8*; *Luke 1:32-33*).\n\n
23:6	idm95009					 This ruler would have the name **The** Lord** Is Our Righteousness** (Hebrew *Yahweh Tsidqenu*), an interesting reversal of Zedekiah’s Hebrew name (*Tsidqiyyahu*), which means “Righteous is the Lord.” Zedekiah’s character and the chaos of his reign were the opposite of the future King’s character and the salvation and **safety** that his reign would offer.\n\n
23:9	idm95022					 These short poems and interjections appear to be excerpts from a session in which the Lord prepared Jeremiah to prosecute the false prophets of Jerusalem. Because these leaders had misused the Lord’s name, they incurred his wrath (*Exod 20:7*).\n\n
23:9	idm95029					 Jeremiah stood in the Lord’s presence, shocked by the severity of the Lord’s decrees of doom on the religious leaders.\n\n
23:10	idm95035					 People everywhere engaged in **adultery**. They thought that the ritual sex of Baal worship would guarantee good crops, but instead it brought the **curse** of a crop-destroying drought upon the people of Judah.\n\n
23:11	idm95043					 Judah’s religious leaders had committed **despicable acts***,* not just in their private lives and in the hills and fields where pagan worship occurred, but even in the **Temple***,* in the presence of the Lord.\n\n
23:12	idm95053					 As a result of their wickedness, these priests and prophets would have no stability in their lives; every moment would be filled with danger.\n\n
23:13	idm95059					 **Samaria***,* the capital of the northern kingdom of **Israel***,* had been dominated by **Baal** worship supported by the government **prophets** (*1 Kgs 18:19*; see also *Jer 16:12*). The religious leaders of Judah were **even worse**. • **Sodom and Gomorrah** represented the worst of this kind of wickedness (*Gen 18:20*).\n\n
23:15	idm95076					 Although the people needed to be held responsible for their own sins, **the prophets** bore the blame for Jerusalem’s spiritual apostasy.\n\n
23:16	idm95083					 The Lord appealed to the **people** to reject **these prophets** and listen instead to his **word**.\n\n
23:16	idm95092					 The false prophets gave the people **futile hopes***;* they had not been commissioned to **speak for the** Lord, and their ideas came from their own imaginations.\n\n
23:17	idm95102					 These prophets lied to the people, assuring them that **peace** would soon come, even though they **despise** the Lord’s **word**. However, the Lord had already decreed destruction.\n\n
23:18	idm95111					 These prophets invented their messages (*23:16*); they had never **been in the** Lord**’s presence***,* and none of them **cared enough to listen** to God’s instruction.\n\n
23:19	idm95123					 Contrary to the lies of the false prophets, the world was facing the **storm** of **the** Lord**’s anger**. The political situation was **a whirlwind** that would soon strike **the wicked**. The Lord had planned this punishment and would ensure that it took place. After the war, the survivors would look back and see that Jeremiah had prophesied correctly.\n\n
23:21	idm95135					 In this stanza, the Lord expressed his keen disappointment and disgust toward the false **prophets**.\n\n
23:22	idm95142					 The messages of the false prophets would have been quite different if they had actually come from the Lord. God wanted the people to reject **their evil ways** (such as Baal worship) and turn to the one true God.\n\n
23:23	idm95149					 The Lord revealed the difference between himself and the Canaanite nature deities. The pagan deities were **close at hand***,* as part of nature. The Lord was close at hand because he created all nature, but he was also **far away** in his distinction from it. His essence is different from nature, yet he is present in **all the heavens and earth**.\n\n
23:25	idm95159					 The false prophets placed a high value on **dreams**. The claim to have had a **dream** supposedly gave authority to a prophet’s message. However, **these prophets** were **inventing everything they** said in order to lead the people away from the Lord.\n\n
23:28	idm95169					 The Lord temporarily allowed the **false prophets** to **tell their dreams**. At the same time, the Lord had his **true messengers***,* such as Jeremiah, to **proclaim** his **every word**. This allowed the people to see the difference between the useless dreams of the false prophets (**straw**) and the nourishing words of the Lord’s messengers (**grain**); cp. *Ps 1:3-4*.\n\n
23:29	idm95184					 The Lord’s **word** has power, **like fire***,* to destroy false prophecies. It would smash the seemingly impregnable fortress of Jerusalem **like a mighty hammer**.\n\n
23:30	idm95194					 The Lord rebuked and opposed the **prophets** who spoke lies in his name.\n\n
23:33	idm95201					 The Lord presented a hypothetical conversation to show Jeremiah how to handle the false prophets.\n\n
23:33	idm95207					 These false **prophets** might taunt Jeremiah by asking for the latest message the Lord had **burdened** him with. • **You are the burden!** This is a wordplay—it was common for a prophetic message to be called “a burden.” The false prophets were a heavy load that the Lord would throw off and **abandon**.\n\n
23:34	idm95217					 Someone might falsely brag that he had heard **a prophecy from the** Lord. However, such a **person** and his **entire family** would be punished (cp. *Num 16:27-32*; *Josh 7:24-25*).\n\n
23:36	idm95229					 The Lord warned that no one should claim to have a **prophecy from the** Lord in order to exert **authority** over other people. Doing so would be contrary to God’s **words** and constitute a misuse of his name (*Exod 20:7*; see also *Matt 20:25-28*).\n\n
23:37	idm95241					 **What is the** Lord** saying?** The Lord had decreed that he would punish the people of Judah and **expel** false prophets. Any prophecy that stated otherwise was not a **prophecy from the** Lord.\n\n
23:40	idm95253					 The false prophets would be **an object of ridicule**. Their predictions would be proved false when Jerusalem was destroyed and the people of the city were taken into exile.\n\n
24:1	idm95260					 This section is a discussion of the meaning of the exile of 597 BC. Some were saying that it had been God’s way of getting the rotten figs out of the barrel (Jerusalem) so that the good figs would survive. Jeremiah said that the exact opposite was the case. The good figs had been taken out of the barrel (into exile) so that the rotten figs would not destroy them.\n\n
24:1	idm95267					 Babylon’s **King Nebuchadnezzar** had taken **Jehoiachin** into captivity to **Babylon** in 597 BC. Jehoiachin’s surrender had spared Jerusalem, but its treasures and 10,000 of its elite citizens had gone into exile (*2 Kgs 24:8-16*). • Typically, **baskets of figs** would be displayed in a market rather than in the Temple area.\n\n
24:4	idm95279					 The people exiled from Jerusalem had a better future than those who remained in the land, because the Lord would **plant** the exiles as a new community of reformed people (see *1:10*).\n\n
24:7	idm95287					 The Lord would do a marvelous work in the **hearts** of the exiles, helping them to **recognize** (literally *know*) . . . **the** Lord as a personal God (*1 Chr 28:9*; *Pss 9:10*; *36:10*; *Isa 19:21*; *52:6*; *Dan 11:32*; *Hos 2:20*; *Titus 1:16*; *1 Jn 4:6-8*). • **They will be my people, and I will be their God:** God’s covenant with Israel would become a personal reality to them (*Exod 6:7*; *19:5*; *Deut 29:13*; *Rev 21:7*). • **wholeheartedly:** The exiles would not mix religious loyalties; they would be completely committed to the one true God.\n\n
24:8	idm95313					 The **bad figs** were those **left in Jerusalem***,* and the Lord would **scatter them** because of their rottenness. Those included in this group ranged from the remainder of the royal family to the common people. In 586 BC, Zedekiah’s reign ended exactly as predicted here.\n\n
25:1	idm95324					 The Lord had long been patient with Jerusalem’s rebellion and refusal to listen, but now the time for judgment was at hand.\n\n
25:1	idm95330					 One of the first acts of Babylon’s king **Nebuchadnezzar** was to force Judah’s king Jehoiakim to confess loyalty to him.\n\n
25:3	idm95337					 Jeremiah’s ministry began in 627 BC.\n\n
25:4	idm95344					 For many generations, God had sent **prophets** to the people, but they had not **paid attention** to the Lord’s warnings.\n\n
25:5	idm95352					 The Lord appealed to his people to **turn from . . . the evil things** they were **doing** that provoked his **anger**. Then he would **not harm** them, but instead pour out his covenant blessings.\n\n
25:7	idm95362					 The people had **not listened** to the Lord’s decrees to turn from their evil ways; instead, they kept **worshiping idols**. So the Lord would **completely destroy** them.\n\n
25:10	idm95371					 All forms of festivity, even simple pleasures such as **singing and laughter***,* would cease. • **millstones . . . lights:** After the destruction of Judah, no one would remain to do the work or to enjoy its fruits.\n\n
25:11	idm95380					 **seventy years:** This is the first instance of a specific time period assigned to the Exile. The prediction was fulfilled either from 605 BC (the first exile to Babylon) to around 538 BC (when Cyrus allowed the exiles to return to Judea), or from 586 BC (the destruction of the Temple) to 515 BC (the dedication of the Second Temple). Or, the number can be seen as symbolic: God’s judgment on Jerusalem would last a perfect lifetime, and for the exact length of time that God had determined.\n\n
25:12	idm95391					 Although the Lord used them to carry out judgment on Judah, the **Babylonians** would be held accountable **for their sins***,* for their brutality, and for their abuse of those they defeated. In 539 BC, Babylon was conquered by Cyrus the Persian, and the people were taken into captivity. For centuries, **many nations and great kings** reduced the Babylonians to slavery, and the territory did not become independent again until 1932, as modern Iraq.\n\n
25:15	idm95402					 The Lord is the sovereign king of **all the nations***,* and their rebellion was about to result in judgment. • **to whom I send you:** Jeremiah did not physically travel to each nation. The message he delivered from the Lord spread mostly through written material, much of it in the book of Jeremiah, which has been read throughout the world.\n\n
25:15	idm95411					 The messages of wrath that the Lord gave to Jeremiah were represented as a **cup** full of the wine of the Lord’s **anger** (*Rev 14:10*). Jeremiah was to make the nations **drink from it***;* God wanted them to hear the messages of condemnation and to experience the promised judgment.\n\n
25:16	idm95422					 Upon drinking from the cup (*25:15*), the nations would **stagger** as though drunken. They would be **crazed by the warfare** and would thus be unable to protect themselves. They would feel hopeless and helpless, and in their confusion, they would panic.\n\n
25:17	idm95431					 **So I . . . made all the nations drink from it:** Jeremiah accomplished this by announcing God’s judgment.\n\n
25:18	idm95438					 Everyone **drank from the cup***,* meaning that the leaders heard the words of judgment. • **From that day until this:** Jeremiah probably delivered the Lord’s messages at the time of the siege and fall of Jerusalem (588–586 BC).\n\n
25:19	idm95448					 The **foreigners** who heard the prophet’s message included many refugees who fled from Judah and neighboring countries to **Egypt** when the Babylonians invaded. • **Uz** was a region on the northern border of Arabia; **Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron,** and **Ashdod** were **Philistine cities** near the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n
25:21	idm95460					 The small nations of **Edom, Moab, and Ammon** were east and southeast of the Dead Sea. The Phoenician cities of **Tyre and Sidon** were to the northwest, along the Mediterranean Sea. The **regions across the sea** were probably the islands of Cyprus and Crete.\n\n
25:23	idm95469					 **Dedan, Tema, . . . Buz***,* and **Zimri** were located in the desert area east of the Jordan Valley, north of **Arabia**. **Elam** and **Media***,* located in the highlands to the east of **Babylon**, made up the core of the Persian Empire, which conquered Babylon in 539 BC.\n\n
25:27	idm95484					 These kingdoms had to **drink from this cup of** the Lord’s **anger** (see *study note on 25:15*). They would be unable to escape the disaster that would overwhelm them. **Jerusalem** experienced God’s judgment, and so would the surrounding nations.\n\n
25:30	idm95494					 First, the Lord spoke through Jeremiah **against his own land***,* Judah; then Jeremiah delivered the messages of God’s judgment **against everyone on earth**.\n\n
25:32	idm95503					 **Disaster . . . great whirlwind of fury:** These words emphasize the awful nature of the wars that tore many nations apart during the 500s BC.\n\n
25:34	idm95511					 The earth’s **evil shepherds** were vicious tyrants who ruled the nations. • **Roll in the dust:** A sign of distress.\n\n
25:36	idm95519					 **ruining their pastures:** The nations led by evil **shepherds** (*25:34*) would be destroyed because the Lord would enforce his sentence.\n\n
25:37	idm95528					 The Lord’s judgment would be so terrifying that it would be **like a strong lion seeking its prey**. As the object of **the** Lord**’s fierce anger***,* the nations would be helpless.\n\n
25:38	idm95539					 Following this verse, the Greek translation of the Old Testament (the Septuagint) attaches chs *46–51*, which deal primarily with the nations listed in ch *25*.\n\n
26:1	idm95547					 Jeremiah was put on trial in the presence of the priests and prophets. The sanctity of the Temple was at issue, for Jeremiah declared that the Lord would destroy the Temple as well as Jerusalem.\n\n
26:2	idm95553					 Jeremiah stood **in the courtyard** of **the Temple** because **the people** of **Judah** gathered there during the scheduled annual festivals.\n\n
26:3	idm95563					 The Lord gave the people a choice about what would happen to them in the future. If they would **turn from their evil ways***,* the Lord would **change** his **mind.** The standard of judgment was his covenant with Israel (see *Deut 5:1-21*; *27:1–28:68*). When Israel obeyed the terms of the covenant, the Lord blessed the people. When Israel persistently and stubbornly disobeyed, the Lord eventually punished them.\n\n
26:4	idm95575					 The people’s ancestors had chosen the way of disobedience; as a result, their sanctuary at **Shiloh***,* north of Jerusalem, had been **destroyed** (*7:12-15*; *1 Sam 1–4*). Similarly, continued disobedience of the covenant commands by the people in Jeremiah’s day would result in the destruction of the **Temple** and **Jerusalem**.\n\n
26:7	idm95588					 The crowd **at the Temple** wanted to **kill** Jeremiah for blasphemy because he had spoken against the Temple. This charge carried the death penalty (*Lev 24:16*). The prophet’s opponents argued that the Lord’s holy Temple could not possibly be destroyed. The priests and prophets had accepted the pagan idea that temples were indestructible because deities dwelt within them.\n\n
26:10	idm95597					 Court trials were customarily held at a gateway to the city. City gateways at this time were covered and multi-chambered. In this location, where the commerce of the city went in and out, the elders of the city would congregate where they could be called upon to apply their wisdom to legal conflicts. In this case, the **officials** were fair; they gave each party an opportunity to present its side of the quarrel.\n\n
26:12	idm95604					 **Jeremiah** argued that **the** Lord had **sent** him to speak against the **city** and the **Temple***;* he added that the impending disaster would not occur if the people of Jerusalem chose to **obey the** Lord.\n\n
26:14	idm95619					 Jeremiah submitted calmly to authority and placed his life in the officials’ **hands***;* however, he warned them that they would bear the **responsibility** for their decision if they killed **an innocent man**.\n\n
26:16	idm95629					 Jeremiah was successful in his defense; he convinced the **officials and the people** that he was innocent because he spoke for **the** Lord.\n\n
26:17	idm95638					 Societies in the ancient Near East greatly revered **wise old men**. Few people survived to old age, and those who did had a valuable store of memory. • **Micah of Moresheth** had lived during **the reign of King Hezekiah** (728–686 BC), more than 100 years earlier. Micah had written a small collection of his prophecies, from which the elders quoted a verse (*Mic 3:12*) that predicted the destruction of **Mount Zion** and **Jerusalem**. These elders counseled the people to do as Hezekiah had done when he **turned from** his **sins** and **worshiped the** Lord. Although the people of Judah relinquished their plan to harm Jeremiah, they did not heed the second part of the old men’s counsel.\n\n
26:24	idm95655					 **Ahikam** had served under King Josiah (*2 Kgs 22:12-14*).\n\n
27:1	idm95663					 The Lord ordered Jeremiah to send messages to the ambassadors from nearby countries to announce the Lord’s judgment upon them. He was to illustrate his message by wearing a wooden yoke. This event took place in 594–593 BC (see *28:1*).\n\n
27:4	idm95671					 The entire weight of the divine name was behind this message (see *study note on 2:2*). The Lord’s authority over everything was a direct challenge to the false nature deities worshiped by each of the nations addressed.\n\n
27:6	idm95678					 God had given **Nebuchadnezzar** authority over the whole region, so resistance to him was futile. **All the nations** would **serve him** and his descendants. The fall of **Babylon** at the hand of Cyrus took place in 539 BC during the reign of Belshazzar, a **grandson** of Nebuchadnezzar.\n\n
27:8	idm95690					 **Babylon’s yoke:** Cp. *21:8-10*; *27:2-3*.\n\n
27:9	idm95699					 Jeremiah warned against those who delivered messages contrary to those of the Lord. **False prophets** made predictions that supported idol worship; **fortune-tellers** claimed to have special abilities to predict future events by reading the stars, staring into crystal balls, and analyzing animal livers; **interpreters of dreams** predicted the future by analyzing people’s dreams and explaining what would happen; **mediums** claimed to converse with dead people; **sorcerers** specialized in casting spells to hurt or bless people by saying certain words or phrases that would concentrate evil or blessing on someone. • **The king of Babylon will not conquer you:** This prediction was false; Nebuchadnezzar conquered the entire region beginning in 605 BC.\n\n
27:12	idm95712					 The terms of God’s decree (*27:4-11*) applied to Judah as much as to the surrounding nations.\n\n
27:16	idm95719					 The **gold articles** and other treasures had been taken **from** the **Temple** in 597 BC.\n\n
27:18	idm95729					 Even the false **prophets** were called upon to repent and **pray to the** Lord.\n\n
27:20	idm95738					 When Judah’s king **Jehoiachin** was taken prisoner, **King Nebuchadnezzar** of **Babylon** left the large, valuable furniture in the **Temple***,* all of which he **carried away** in 586 BC.\n\n
27:22	idm95751					 When Cyrus of Persia allowed the exiles to return in 538 BC, they also brought the Temple furnishings **back to Jerusalem** with them (*Ezra 1:7-11*; *5:13-15*).\n\n
28:1	idm95761					 Soon after the events of ch *27*, a false prophet named **Hananiah** publicly confronted Jeremiah in the Temple courtyard. Each prophet gave what he claimed was a message from the Lord, but only Jeremiah’s prediction came true.\n\n
28:1	idm95769					 The **people** were **in the Temple***,* so it was probably the occasion of one of the annual fall festivals, either the Day of Atonement (*Lev 23:26-32*) or the Festival of Shelters (*Lev 23:33-36*).\n\n
28:2	idm95780					 Hananiah’s message was the approved propaganda, but he used strong terms (cp. *27:4*) to claim the Lord’s authority. • Judah had been under the **yoke of the king of Babylon** since 597 BC.\n\n
28:4	idm95789					 The false prophet’s message claimed that **Jehoiachin** would return, which implied that Zedekiah held a lower status as ruler over the kingdom of Judah (see *study note on Ezek 1:2*). • **I, the** Lord**, have spoken:** Hananiah closed with the same strong appeal to divine authority that Jeremiah often used.\n\n
28:5	idm95800					 **Amen!** (literally *So be it!*): Jeremiah would have been happy to see this prediction fulfilled.\n\n
28:7	idm95808					 Only when a prophet’s **predictions come true** can people be certain that he has spoken the Lord’s word (*Deut 18:20-22*).\n\n
28:10	idm95816					 The false prophet Hananiah **broke** the yoke that Jeremiah was wearing (*27:2*) as a sign of what the Lord would do. • **Jeremiah left** the confrontation without replying, probably because he had not yet received the Lord’s response.\n\n
28:12	idm95825					 Jeremiah received and delivered the Lord’s response to the false prophecy. The **wooden yoke** that **Hananiah** broke was replaced by a metaphorical **yoke of iron.** Subjection to **Babylon** was an absolute certainty, for the Lord had decreed it.\n\n
28:15	idm95835					 **You must die:** The Lord’s decree for **Hananiah** was the lawful penalty for false prophets (*Deut 13:1-5*). The Lord carried out the decree that **very year***;* Jeremiah’s prophecy was validated when it was fulfilled **two months later.** In contrast, Hananiah’s prediction that the Temple treasures would be returned in two years was not fulfilled. The Lord demonstrated that he was still in control.\n\n
29:1	idm95847					 Jeremiah contacted the Hebrew exiles in Babylon by letter. To reach all the scattered Israelites, his letter would be read repeatedly from settlement to settlement.\n\n
29:2	idm95853					 **had been deported from Jerusalem:** This refers to the exile of 597 BC.\n\n
29:5	idm95861					 Jeremiah urged the exiled people to **plan to stay** in Babylon for a long time. God wanted them to become productive citizens, concerned and praying **to the** Lord for the **welfare** of the Babylonian communities in which they lived, so their population could grow. They should not listen to false prophecies such as Hananiah’s, promising that they would be coming home shortly.\n\n
29:8	idm95871					 The next divine command warned against false **prophets and fortune-tellers**.\n\n
29:10	idm95878					 The exiled people of Judah would **be in Babylon for seventy years***;* this was not new information (see *25:11*), but Jeremiah’s audiences in Jerusalem had not believed him. Now that those people were in exile, they needed to accept reality.\n\n
29:11	idm95887					 The Lord’s **plans for good***,* to prosper the exiled people and to return them to the land of Judah, gave them **a future and a hope**. This promise was specific to the exiles in Babylon, but it has given hope to millions of God’s people in various difficult circumstances.\n\n
29:12	idm95896					 Through Jeremiah, the Lord reminded the exiled people that if they would **look for** him **wholeheartedly***,* they would **find** him. The Exile taught the Israelites to reject false gods and give their wholehearted devotion to the Lord (*Deut 6:4-6*). It also gave them a new commitment to the revealed word of God.\n\n
29:15	idm95907					 False **prophets** could still be found among the exiles; they held out hope for the survival of Jerusalem and a quick end to the Exile.\n\n
29:16	idm95914					 To keep the exiles in **Babylon** from thinking that they were worse off than those left behind, the Lord reiterated his decree of disaster for the **bad figs** still in Jerusalem (see *24:6-10*); their time of horror was yet to come.\n\n
29:20	idm95923					 Although Jeremiah was in Jerusalem, God was able to tell him what was happening in Babylon, just as he was able to tell Ezekiel in Babylon what was happening in Jerusalem (*Ezek 8*). • The Lord named two prophets who were **telling . . . lies** in his **name***,* and sentenced them to death (*Deut 18:20-22*; cp. *Jer 26:14-15*; *28:16-17*).\n\n
29:24	idm95936					 A prophet in Babylon named **Shemaiah** took issue with Jeremiah’s written advice that the exiles should accept a long exile (*29:4-23*). Shemaiah sent a letter to a leading priest in Jerusalem, urging him to take action against Jeremiah; Jeremiah responded with a letter to the exiles that condemned Shemaiah.\n\n
29:29	idm95944					 **Zephaniah** had enough good sense to show **Jeremiah** the letter from Shemaiah.\n\n
29:30	idm95952					 Since Shemaiah had no commission from the Lord, he was a liar; he tried to persuade the exiles to believe in a brief exile. With a threefold invocation of the Lord’s authority (see *study note on 2:2*), Shemaiah was charged, convicted, and sentenced to execution.\n\n
30:1	idm95959					 These four chapters are often called “The Book of Consolation,” a high point in Old Testament revelation. In contrast to the many messages of judgment that Jeremiah delivered to his people, these messages are filled with hope and point to a marvelous future restoration.\n\n
30:1	idm95965					 This series of messages is mainly positive, with only two verses carrying a tone of judgment (*30:23-24*). They speak of the beneficial effects of the destruction of Jerusalem and of the Exile.\n\n
30:3	idm95972					 The new messages expand on the theme of *29:10-14* (see *3:18*; *16:15*; *24:6*). The fall of Jerusalem and the Exile did not mark the end of the Lord’s relationship with Israel. The Lord had a wonderful future for the remnant of his **people**. Descendants of people from the northern kingdom of **Israel** who were taken into exile by the Assyrians in 722 BC would be restored. Likewise, descendants of the people of **Judah** who were taken into Babylonian exile in 597 and 586 BC would return to the Promised Land. • **I will bring them home:** The first major return from exile occurred in 538 BC (*Ezra 1:1–6:22*), the second in 458 BC (*Ezra 7:1–10:44*), and the third in 445 BC (*Neh 1–13*).\n\n
30:7	idm95994					 The **time of trouble** was the Babylonian capture and the final destruction of Judah in 586 BC.\n\n
30:8	idm96002					 Although the return of the exiles began in 538 BC, **foreigners** were still **their masters** for most of Israel’s history from the Exile through the Roman period. However, Israel experienced a measure of freedom during that time.\n\n
30:9	idm96011					 After the Exile, the Israelites cast aside their persistent worship of idols and truly served **the** Lord** their God**. • The Lord would provide a **king***,* also a descendant of **David***,* who would be called the Messiah (*Isa 55:3-4*; *Ezek 34:23*; *37:24*; *Hos 3:5*; *Luke 1:69*; *Acts 2:30*; *13:22-23*).\n\n
30:10	idm96031					 The gathering of exiles would include those held in Babylon and also those who were scattered in **distant lands**. The Lord’s promised gifts would include **peace and quiet** without fearsome enemies.\n\n
30:11	idm96039					 The Lord could make these promises because he was **with** his people and had the power to **save** them. He promised to destroy vicious **nations** and preserve his people. Still, the Lord would **discipline** his people if they sinned.\n\n
30:12	idm96049					 The exiles suffered **injury**—**a terrible wound***—*because of their many **sins**. • **lovers . . . allies:** The Lord used these terms to refer to nations, especially Egypt, that had been Judah’s trusted friends (see *4:30*; *Ezek 16:15-63*).\n\n
30:15	idm96062					 The Israelites had no right to **protest** their **punishment***;* they deserved their exile, and God’s justice demanded that they be punished.\n\n
30:16	idm96071					 **all who devour you will be devoured:** See *25:11-12*.\n\n
30:17	idm96079					 **I will . . . heal your wounds:** The people would return from exile and their sins would be removed.\n\n
30:18	idm96086					 The walls of **Jerusalem** were **rebuilt** in 445 BC under Nehemiah’s leadership (*Neh 12:22-43*).\n\n
30:19	idm96096					 The rebuilt Jerusalem would be the center of a healthy and growing nation. Its growing population would experience **joy** and sing **songs of thanksgiving**. The city would be honored by its neighbors, and its streets would be filled with **children** who would grow up and **prosper**. The nation would have its **own ruler again**.\n\n
30:22	idm96107					 The Lord wanted to establish a nation whose **people** were totally committed to worshiping him as the one true **God** (*Exod 6:7*; *Ezek 36:38*).\n\n
30:23	idm96117					 The reestablished nation was still held accountable for rebellion. The Lord reserved the authority to express his stormy **anger** against **the wicked**.\n\n
30:24	idm96125					 Punishment remained an important aspect of what the Lord had **planned**. The Israelites, including Jeremiah, found it difficult to reconcile divine promises with divine **anger**. Looking back on events at a later time would help the people to **understand** this paradox.\n\n
31:1	idm96134					 **In that day:** This phrase refers to the return from exile that began in 538 BC. • **all the families of Israel:** The coming restoration included all twelve tribes of Israel.\n\n
31:2	idm96143					 The Lord directed his message to those who would **survive the coming destruction** at the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC.\n\n
31:3	idm96151					 **Long ago***,* the Lord had revealed himself during the Exodus (see *Exod 15:13*; *20:6*; *34:6-7*; *Num 14:18-19*; *Deut 5:10*; *7:7*, *10*, *12-13*; *10:15*, *18*).\n\n
31:4	idm96169					 In their homeland, the Israelites had been guilty of “adultery” with false gods. The restored community would be like a **virgin***,* as though the people had never forsaken the Lord. The happiness and joy of their celebrations would manifest this transformation.\n\n
31:5	idm96177					 **Samaria** was located in north-central Israel.\n\n
31:6	idm96184					 In the fully restored nation, the kingdom would no longer be divided (*1 Kgs 12:16-29*; *Ezek 37:16-22*).\n\n
31:7	idm96192					 The **remnant** refers to those who were living in exile.\n\n
31:8	idm96199					 The Lord promised to gather the surviving exiles from wherever they were scattered without overlooking the weak and helpless. • The **great company** of exiles who returned in 538–536 BC numbered 49,697 (*Ezra 2:64*).\n\n
31:9	idm96208					 Those returning to their homeland would cry for **joy***,* knowing the Lord as their shepherd (*Ps 23:1-3*) and feeling secure (see *Isa 35:10*) with God as their **father**.\n\n
31:10	idm96219					 **The** Lord promised to **gather** his people from the **nations of the world** and be their **shepherd** in place of the wicked shepherds who had led Israel and Judah astray.\n\n
31:11	idm96230					 The Lord alone could accomplish the people’s release from exile.\n\n
31:12	idm96236					 The restored community would enjoy **the** Lord**’s good gifts**. The people could expect **abundant crops** to spring forth in the fields with no appeal to Baal. The **sorrows** of their exile would be cast off, and the returnees could expect to be fruitful, **like a watered garden**. \n\n
31:13	idm96248					 The Lord would replace **mourning***,* a daily experience in exile, with his **comfort** and a continual outpouring of **rejoicing** (see *Isa 40:1-3*; *61:3*).\n\n
31:14	idm96260					 The **priests** and the **people** would **enjoy abundance** because the people would pay their tithes rather than robbing God (*Mal 3:8-12*).\n\n
31:15	idm96270					 The Lord expanded on his future project of rebuilding a new nation out of a people who had suffered greatly during their lengthy captivity.\n\n
31:15	idm96276					 **Rachel***,* Jacob’s favorite wife, was the mother of Joseph (father of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh in the northern kingdom) and Benjamin (whose descendants were in the southern kingdom). She represented the mothers in all Israel whose children were taken into exile. • *Matthew 2:18* quotes this verse in relation to the slaughter of the young boys in Bethlehem.\n\n
31:16	idm96285					 Rachel should not **weep***,* because the Lord promised to bring her exiled **children** out of captivity and back **to their own land**.\n\n
31:18	idm96295					 **Israel** was now repenting of its sins and humbly asking for restoration; the people realized that they had no power to redeem themselves. They were turning away from idols and affirming that God **alone** is **the** Lord.\n\n
31:19	idm96305					 When the exiles realized the **stupidity** of their sins, they were **ashamed**.\n\n
31:20	idm96313					 The exiled people had been in the Lord’s memory all along. God responded to his people’s repentance with a father’s love for his wayward children (cp. *Luke 15:11-24*).\n\n
31:21	idm96320					 **road signs . . . guideposts:** The Lord guided his people physically back to the land of Israel and spiritually back to their covenant relationship with him.\n\n
31:26	idm96327					 Evidently, either Jeremiah or his scribe had fallen asleep and was awakened with a start. His **sleep** was **very sweet***,* like the rest and joy promised by the Lord (*31:25*).\n\n
31:27	idm96337					 A clear indication of the Lord’s care for **Israel and Judah** would be their **population** growth and **the number of animals** grazing in their pastures.\n\n
31:28	idm96346					 **The future** refers to the return of the exiled people to the Promised Land, whom the Lord had promised to **plant** and **build** (see *1:10*).\n\n
31:29	idm96356					 Some seemed to think that this **proverb** (apparently a misinterpretation of *Exod 20:5*; *34:7*; *Num 14:18*) meant that innocent children were dying because of their parents’ sins. The Lord made it clear that each individual is punished for his or her own sins (see *Lam 5:7*; *Ezek 18:2-32*; *33:10-20*).\n\n
31:31	idm96369					 **The day** of the **new covenant** was realized when Jesus Christ accomplished his redemptive mission on earth (see *Heb 8:8-12*).\n\n
31:32	idm96378					 The key difference between the **new covenant** and the **one** God **made with their ancestors** is that the Lord would **write** his **instructions deep within** his people’s **hearts** (see *Heb 10:16*). The old covenant was external and legal, whereas the new covenant would be a vital, person-to-person relationship. The new covenant would emphasize the redeeming, transforming change of an individual’s spiritual nature.\n\n
31:34	idm96391					 The old covenant had to be taught (see *Deut 6:4-9*), but the heart of the new covenant would be an inner, personal relationship with the Lord. • **I will forgive:** Each repentant believer would experience God’s forgiveness. • **I will never again remember:** When sins are forgiven, they can never bring divine judgment (see *Heb 10:17*). • Jesus’ death inaugurated the new covenant (see *Matt 26:28*; *Mark 14:24*; *Luke 22:20*; *1 Cor 11:25*; *2 Cor 3:6*; *Heb 8*; *9:15*; *12:22-24*).\n\n
31:35	idm96409					 The Lord compared his promise of the new covenant to his faithfulness in maintaining **the laws of nature.**\n\n
31:38	idm96416					 The Lord revealed his plan for **Jerusalem** to **be rebuilt**. The **Tower of Hananel** stood at the northeast corner of the old city, while the **Corner Gate** had been at the northwest corner (*2 Kgs 14:13*; *2 Chr 26:9*).\n\n
31:39	idm96428					 **Gareb** and **Goah** do not appear elsewhere in Scripture, but they were probably on the west side of the city.\n\n
31:40	idm96436					 Jerusalem will be an eternal **holy . . . city***,* present in the heavenly realm and on the new earth (*Rev 21–22*). • The **graveyard and ash dump** were in the valley of Ben-Hinnom (see *study note on Jer 7:30-34*) on the south side of the city, and the **Kidron Valley** was **on the east** (*2 Kgs 23:4-6*). • The exact location of the **Horse Gate** on the eastern wall is unknown.\n\n
32:2	idm96451					 **Jerusalem** had been **under siege** since January 588 BC (*2 Kgs 25:1*). • **Jeremiah** favored surrender to the Babylonians, but the thought angered many who believed that they could successfully defy the foreign army. To protect Jeremiah, Zedekiah **imprisoned** him in **the courtyard of the guard** (*Jer 37:21*).\n\n
32:4	idm96465					 Continuing to resist **the Babylonians** was hopeless; it would result in disaster for the city and for **Zedekiah**.\n\n
32:6	idm96473					 **Anathoth** was Jeremiah’s hometown (*1:1*). • **By law you have the right:** Hebrew custom required Jeremiah’s cousin to offer the land first to his nearest relative (see *Lev 25:25*, *32*; *Ruth 4:1-4*).\n\n
32:9	idm96485					 Many people might have thought that Jeremiah did a foolish thing when he agreed to buy the land. After the fall of Jerusalem and the exile of many people, the value of the land would drop to almost nothing. Still, Jeremiah immediately **bought the field**. • *Matthew 27:9-10* refers to the “prophecy of Jeremiah,” which might be an allusion to this event.\n\n
32:10	idm96493					 Jeremiah carefully followed the proper legal procedures for buying property. The **deed of purchase** was a sheet of papyrus that listed the terms of the purchase in Hebrew. Jeremiah **signed and sealed the deed** and paid the purchase price in the presence of **witnesses** (*Gen 23:3-18*; *2 Sam 24:20-24*).\n\n
32:11	idm96504					 According to custom, a copy of the **deed** was made. The two documents were entrusted to the care of Jeremiah’s secretary, **Baruch**. This was done publicly, **in the courtyard of the guardhouse**.\n\n
32:13	idm96513					 According to custom, the two copies of the **deed** were placed in a **pottery jar** so that they would be preserved **for a long time**.\n\n
32:15	idm96522					 Jeremiah explained the reason for his purchase: He was making an investment in the future that God had promised. **Someday** exiled survivors of the destruction of Judah would return, and worthless land would again become productive and valuable. Jeremiah had already predicted that the exile would last for seventy years (*25:11-12*; *29:10*). Jeremiah’s purchase was a declaration of faith in the Lord’s plan for restoring his people.\n\n
32:16	idm96531					 This prayer of Jeremiah differed from his previous prayers, which expressed strong emotions of anguish and despair and even sharp criticism of the Lord’s treatment of the people of Judah. This prayer was calm, affirming, and worshipful.\n\n
32:16	idm96537					 Jeremiah **prayed** in response to his purchase of land.\n\n
32:17	idm96544					 As the all-powerful Creator of all things, the **Sovereign** Lord could do what he had promised for his people.\n\n
32:18	idm96552					 The Lord consistently showed his **unfailing love***,* but he also held generations accountable for their sins, and their children harvested the consequences. Through his mercy and his judgment, **the** Lord demonstrated his unlimited power. Jeremiah was confident that the Lord would show his love to his people as he had promised.\n\n
32:19	idm96562					 The Lord knows what each person does, and he holds each one accountable as he judges their sins fairly.\n\n
32:20	idm96568					 The Lord had done **great miracles** throughout the history of **Israel***,* but he had also been active **all around the world**. As a result, everyone knew about Israel’s God.\n\n
32:21	idm96578					 The first great miracle in Israel’s history was the exodus from **Egypt***,* an act filled with **mighty signs and wonders**. These divine acts caused **terror** in Egypt and among the desert tribes.\n\n
32:22	idm96588					 God also gave the productive Promised Land to Israel.\n\n
32:23	idm96594					 After Israel entered the Promised Land, they quickly turned from faithfully obeying the Lord. Generation after generation up to Jeremiah’s day was guilty of rebellion. This long history of sin was the cause of the present **terrible disaster**. Previously, Jeremiah had trouble accepting that this act of God was just, but now he saw that the Lord’s **word** was true.\n\n
32:24	idm96602					 Jeremiah was amazed at the skill of the attacking Babylonians. They used **ramps** to lay siege to the walled **city**. Within Jerusalem, he saw the horrors of **war, famine, and disease**. It was obvious that the **Babylonians** would **conquer** the city. A sense of awe swept through Jeremiah as he realized that he was seeing the fulfillment of **everything** the Lord had **said**.\n\n
32:25	idm96615					 Jeremiah was still puzzled about the Lord’s command to **buy the field** (*32:8*). That field would be under the control of the Babylonian army, and the purchase price drew on Jeremiah’s **good money***,* his savings. Because the Lord had decreed that **the city** would be destroyed, the purchase appeared futile from a human perspective.\n\n
32:26	idm96626					 The Lord responded to Jeremiah’s concern (*32:25*) with several affirmations. The Lord had decided on his course of action, the events of the immediate and long-range future had been established, and real doom was hanging over Jerusalem.\n\n
32:26	idm96633					 The Lord affirmed that he is the sovereign **God of all the peoples of the world**. • Using a rhetorical question, the Lord also affirmed that nothing is **too hard** for him.\n\n
32:28	idm96641					 The Lord affirmed that the army of **Nebuchadnezzar** would soon crash through the walls, Jerusalem would be captured, and **fire** would consume everything that could **burn**. • **Baal** worship was both a family affair and a national commitment (see *7:17-18*). All the places used for idol worship, including individual **houses***,* would be destroyed.\n\n
32:30	idm96654					 The Lord continued to affirm his plans, recounting that **Israel and Judah** had done **evil***,* had turned their backs on the Lord, and had **stirred up** his **anger** against their sin.\n\n
32:30	idm96665					 The people of **Israel** (the northern tribes) and **Judah** (the southern tribes) had worshiped idols for centuries, **since their earliest days***,* contrary to God’s ancient covenant with them. The Lord was **infuriated** by these **evil deeds**.\n\n
32:31	idm96677					 **The time this city was built** refers to the reigns of David and Solomon, when Jerusalem became the capital city of Israel. During the history of the northern kingdom of Israel, every king promoted worship of false gods. In the kingdom of Judah, only a few kings encouraged worship of the Lord, usually without lasting success (e.g., *2 Chr 14:3*; *17:6*; *29:5*; *33:15-16*; *34:3*, *31-32*). The northern kingdom had already been destroyed (*2 Kgs 17:5-12*), and now the Lord had decided **to get rid of** the southern kingdom of Judah (see *Deut 8:19-20*).\n\n
32:34	idm96693					 The people had sinned by defiling God’s **own Temple** with **abominable idols** (*Ezek 8:3*). The leaders of Judah were also known to **sacrifice** their own children to an Ammonite deity named **Molech** (cp. *Jer 7:30-34*).\n\n
32:36	idm96705					 The Lord affirmed that the destruction of Jerusalem would not bring an end to his plans. Beyond the immediate doom, the Lord planned a future of salvation and restoration for his people.\n\n
32:36	idm96711					 Jeremiah was responsible for repeating whatever the Lord told him, even if the messages seemed contradictory on the surface. Jeremiah had been saying for years that God was going to destroy the city. Now he was saying that God would rebuild the city. Cp. *Isa 38:1-6*.\n\n
32:37	idm96718					 God would **certainly bring** his **people back again** to Jerusalem, where they would **live in peace and safety**.\n\n
32:38	idm96727					 The new covenant (*31:31-34*) would take root deep within the spiritual being of the people, both as individuals and in the community. • **They will be my people, and I will be their God:** A deep relationship between God and his people would finally be realized, as had been the intent of the **covenant** all along (*7:23*; *Lev 26:12*; *Ezek 11:20*; *37:23*; *Zech 8:8*).\n\n
32:39	idm96741					 Under the new covenant, the people would **worship** the one true God rather than idols.\n\n
32:41	idm96748					 **find joy:** The Lord’s anger at seeing his people worship sex-idols and his grief in punishing them for breaching the old covenant would be gone. No longer would he uproot them (*1:10*); instead, it would be his delight to **replant** them.\n\n
32:42	idm96757					 God’s promises for good were just as certain as the judgments that were being carried out as the Babylonians laid siege to Jerusalem.\n\n
32:44	idm96763					 **fields will once again be bought and sold:** The Lord directly answered Jeremiah’s query (*32:25*). Jeremiah had **signed and sealed and witnessed** a deed for his inherited property (*32:9-11*), and people would do the same throughout the land of Judah.\n\n
33:1	idm96773					 As the city of Jerusalem and the king of Judah were falling to invaders, God gave Jeremiah a greater understanding of his long-range plan. The promises could only come true after the promised destruction. The hope of the nation was not to be found in escape from destruction but in the purification that destruction would bring. • **Jeremiah was . . . confined in the courtyard of the guard** in the royal palace from the latter part of 587 BC, when the siege was underway, until the fall of Jerusalem in August 586 BC (see *32:2*).\n\n
33:2	idm96783					 The Lord grounded this message in his power as the Creator of all things, and in the power of his **name**.\n\n
33:4	idm96790					 Zedekiah and his men had **torn down** some structures to reinforce the city’s walls against the Babylonians’ **siege ramps and swords**.\n\n
33:5	idm96798					 The **men** were **already as good as dead** because the Lord had decreed the destruction of the city.\n\n
33:8	idm96806					 The Lord promised to **cleanse** and **forgive all their sins of rebellion***;* this was the foundation upon which the new, everlasting covenant would rest (*31:34*; *32:38-41*).\n\n
33:9	idm96817					 Once the new covenant was established, **all the nations of the earth** would see the Lord’s blessing on Jerusalem.\n\n
33:10	idm96824					 Although seventy years of exile would come first, the Lord’s curse (*7:34*) would be reversed (*25:10-12*). Singing would be a hallmark of the restored worship (*Ps 136:1*). This prediction was fulfilled in 538–536 BC when worship in Jerusalem was restored and the foundations of the Second Temple were laid (*Ezra 3*).\n\n
33:11	idm96835					 **bridegrooms and brides:** Contrast the earlier prophecies in *7:34* and *25:10*.\n\n
33:12	idm96844					 The **land** was **desolate** as a result of the Babylonian invasion.\n\n
33:14	idm96852					 Picking up on the discussion of flaws in Zedekiah and the other kings of David’s dynasty (*23:1-5*), the Lord revealed the glories of the new ruler of the future.\n\n
33:14	idm96859					 **The day will come. . . . In those days:** These phrases point beyond the exiles’ return to a more distant event mentioned previously by the Lord’s prophets (*Isa 32:1-2*). They indicate the New Testament fulfillment of God’s plan in Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd (*John 10:11*) and the **righteous descendant** (literally *a righteous branch;* *Isa 4:2*; *11:1*; *Zech 3:8*; *6:12*, *13*). • **He:** An individual, not a remnant, would be a fair judge and bring justice with his pronouncements.\n\n
33:16	idm96876					 **The** Lord** Is Our Righteousness:** Hebrew *Yahweh Tsidqenu**;* see *23:5-6*, where this title is given to the Messiah. This name was a reversal of Zedekiah’s name (*Tsidqiyyahu**,* “Righteous is the Lord”). Zedekiah did not live up to his name, but the Messiah would do so.\n\n
33:17	idm96891					 Though Zedekiah was the last **descendant** of **David** to rule over the kingdom of Judah, the Messiah, a future descendant of David, would be Israel’s king **forever**.\n\n
33:18	idm96900					 After the exiles returned to Jerusalem, **Levitical priests** conducted worship in the new Temple (*Ezra 6:13-22*).\n\n
33:19	idm96908					 Jeremiah delivered God’s promise that the new covenant of the Lord with the descendant of **David** and with the **Levitical priests** would be as sure as the sequence of day and night.\n\n
33:23	idm96916					 The Lord had rejected individuals, cities, and kingdoms, but he would **never abandon** his people, who stretched across many generations.\n\n
34:1	idm96923					 This section begins with the prediction of Jerusalem’s fall and Zedekiah’s captivity (*34:1-7*); the fulfillment of that prediction comes toward the end (*39:1-10*). These messages underline the truth that the old covenant had been irreparably broken, especially by those kings descended from David who should have been most committed to maintaining it.\n\n
34:1	idm96931					 The Lord encouraged Zedekiah, even though he was a weak leader who lacked courage. The message contains judgment and a promise.\n\n
34:2	idm96937					 No matter what **King Zedekiah** did, Jerusalem would fall. The Lord would not rescue the **city**.\n\n
34:4	idm96945					 Even though the Babylonians would defeat **Judah***,* the Lord promised to protect **Zedekiah** during the war; the king would **die peacefully** and be honored by the survivors of the siege. But see *39:5-7* for a description of Zedekiah’s being captured and tortured and then taken away to Babylon.\n\n
34:6	idm96956					 King Rehoboam had made **Lachish** and **Azekah** into forts (*2 Chr 11:5-10*). Located on low hills southwest of Jerusalem, these towns guarded the key roads leading up from the great highway on the coast into the heartland of Judah. Military messages written on pieces of pottery have been found in the gateway of Lachish, reporting the progress of the Babylonians as they moved toward it.\n\n
34:8	idm96965					 Here are faithless (*34:8-22*) and faithful (*35:1-19*) examples of covenant-keeping.\n\n
34:8	idm96973					 **Zedekiah** ordered the **people to free** their **slaves***;* he was apparently trying to curry favor with God by enforcing the covenant requirements regarding the Hebrew ownership of slaves (*Exod 21:2-4*) that had been neglected since Moses’ time. However, the order was worse than useless because the people soon went back on this new affirmation of the **covenant***,* just as they had broken their treaty with Nebuchadnezzar (see *Ezek 21:23-24*) and their original covenant with the Lord. The Lord would punish them as their treachery deserved.\n\n
34:15	idm96987					 The slaveholders had done **what was right** in releasing their slaves; they had obeyed God’s **command**. But their **covenant** had been made **in the Temple***,* and when they broke their covenant, they **defiled** God’s **name** and treated it with contempt (in violation of *Deut 5:11*).\n\n
34:17	idm97001					 Because of their sin in breaking **the terms of** their **covenant***,* the Lord would **cut** them **apart** and separate them from his protective care. This expression relates to the covenant ceremony of killing and cutting a **calf** sacrifice into two parts from head to tail. Those making a covenant walked between the laid-out portions to indicate their willingness to be similarly **cut apart** if they violated the covenant (see *Gen 15:9-18*). All classes of people in Judah had **broken** their **oath***,* so they would all receive the punishment to which they had agreed.\n\n
34:21	idm97018					 Pharaoh Hophra had a treaty with Zedekiah to help him if he were attacked (*Isa 30:1-3*; *31:1-3*). The Babylonians **left Jerusalem** to fight against Pharaoh Hophra (*Jer 37:5-7*), but their departure was temporary.\n\n
35:1	idm97028					 These two chapters look back two decades to the time when Jehoiakim was on the throne.\n\n
35:1	idm97034					 The Recabites’ obedience to their ancestor contrasted sharply with the Israelites’ rebellion against the Lord their God.\n\n
35:1	idm97040					 This incident took place during Jehoiakim’s reign, when the Babylonian army first attacked Jerusalem (605 BC; see *35:11*).\n\n
35:2	idm97048					 The **Recabites** were descendants of Jehonadab son of Recab, a Kenite who had served under Jehu, king of Israel (*2 Kgs 10:15*, *23*; *1 Chr 2:55*). Jeremiah probably knew that the Recabites did not drink **wine***,* but he obeyed the Lord’s command.\n\n
35:3	idm97060					 The **Jeremiah** mentioned here was not the prophet; he and the others represented the **Recabite** community.\n\n
35:4	idm97068					 Jeremiah the prophet carefully described the location of the room in the Temple, taking note that **Hanan***,* the man in charge, was **a man of God**. During this idolatrous time in Judah’s history, the prophet had some friends in high places who remained believers in the one true God.\n\n
35:6	idm97077					 **Jehonadab** had bound his descendants to a nomadic lifestyle free of the trappings of sedentary life, and the Recabites had been obedient.\n\n
35:12	idm97084					 The Lord applied the Recabites’ example in stark contrast to the people of Judah. The Recabites had been deprived of many good things in life, yet they remained obedient.\n\n
35:14	idm97090					 The Recabites never drank **wine***,* simply because their human **ancestor** had told them not to. The people of Israel should have been even more willing to listen and obey when the Lord told them to **turn from** their **wicked ways** and live according to his laws.\n\n
35:17	idm97101					 The Lord pronounced punishment on Judah’s sin.\n\n
35:19	idm97107					 One of the **descendants** of **Jehonadab son of Recab** apparently returned from Babylon after the Exile and helped to rebuild the wall of Jerusalem (see *Neh 3:14*).\n\n
36:1	idm97116					 This description of Jehoiakim’s cynical response to God’s attempt to call him to repentance and covenant obedience (*36:3*, *7*) graphically underscores the hopelessness of the situation. • Nowhere else does the Old Testament provide this much detail about the process of preserving spoken messages in written form.\n\n
36:1	idm97124					 The **fourth year** of Jehoiakim’s reign, 605 BC, was the year Nebuchadnezzar first attacked Jerusalem (see *study note on Dan 1:1*). • In those days, a **scroll** was a roll of papyrus or leather strips joined edge to edge and rolled up.\n\n
36:3	idm97134					 The Lord gave **the people of Judah** every opportunity to **repent**. God wanted the messages of judgment not just to alarm his people, but to awaken them to the judgment they would face if they did not turn from idol-worship. If they heeded the alarm, repented, and sincerely worshiped the one true God, he would **forgive their sins and wrongdoings**.\n\n
36:4	idm97143					 Evidently, Jeremiah was not skilled in writing, so he enlisted the services of a scribe named **Baruch**. As they sat in their private quarters, **Jeremiah** repeated message after message from memory. It is not known whether Baruch had a role in composition or arrangement, or whether he simply recorded exactly what Jeremiah dictated.\n\n
36:5	idm97151					 **Jeremiah** was either **a prisoner** under house arrest, or he had been banished from **the Temple** grounds.\n\n
36:6	idm97160					 The **next day of fasting** was a national festival, but it is not clear which one (none of the annual festivals occurred in the ninth month; see *study note on 36:8-9*). Reading the written scroll to the multitude gathered in the **Temple** would have placed Baruch in danger of arrest or assault.\n\n
36:7	idm97169					 Jeremiah repeated the purpose for writing the scroll (*36:3*) and reading it in public. • **Perhaps . . . turn from their evil ways:** The people could still receive the Lord’s **forgiveness** and avert his **anger**.\n\n
36:8	idm97179					 Baruch filled the columns of the scroll with Jeremiah’s messages from the Lord. Finally, a day of fasting was announced toward the end of 604 BC. Baruch faithfully obeyed Jeremiah’s order to read the scroll in the **Temple***,* where many people crowded the courtyard.\n\n
36:10	idm97188					 **Baruch . . . stood in front of the Temple room of Gemariah:** That is, Baruch obtained permission from this high official to read to the public. This elevated location **near the New Gate entrance** was close to where Jeremiah’s public trial had taken place a few years earlier (*26:10*). • **Gemariah** had a godly heritage. His father, **Shaphan***,* had participated in Josiah’s reading of the scrolls found in the Temple (*2 Kgs 22:8-10*).\n\n
36:11	idm97201					 **Micaiah** realized the importance of **the messages from the** Lord that Baruch was reading, so he made sure that the **administrative officials** of the palace knew what was being said.\n\n
36:14	idm97211					 The palace **officials** acted quickly. When they heard **Baruch** reading Jeremiah’s messages, they were terrified and decided to report the situation to the king.\n\n
36:17	idm97219					 The officials wanted to know the source of the **scroll** and its **messages**.\n\n
36:19	idm97227					 The officials showed their respect for Jeremiah and Baruch by advising that they **should both hide***;* they showed their respect for the Lord’s messages by placing the scroll in **safekeeping** while they went to inform the king.\n\n
36:21	idm97236					 **Jehudi** was well educated, and was perhaps a scribe. Only the elite were trained to read and write.\n\n
36:23	idm97243					 Jehoiakim was so antagonistic and hardened that after **three or four columns** of the scroll were read, he cut off the **section** with a sharp **knife** and **threw it into the fire**. Jehoiakim’s father, Josiah, had responded very differently when the newly discovered Book of the Law was read to him (*2 Kgs 22:11*).\n\n
36:25	idm97254					 The three officials who **begged the king** not to destroy **the scroll** probably held positions of great power, because Jehoiakim did not punish them for trying to preserve Jeremiah’s scroll.\n\n
36:26	idm97262					 Once **the** Lord** had hidden them***,* no one betrayed Jeremiah and Baruch. The Lord can protect his servants.\n\n
36:27	idm97272					 While in hiding, Jeremiah and Baruch rewrote all the messages that had been recorded on the destroyed scroll onto a new roll of papyrus. No human king can destroy God’s words. Instead, Jehoiakim was brought before God’s court and sentenced to death.\n\n
36:29	idm97278					 To die without **heirs** or a decent burial was to suffer the worst imaginable fate (see *22:19*; *Eccl 6:3*). Jehoiakim’s son Jehoiachin ruled for just three months. Unlike his father, Jehoiachin took Jeremiah’s warning seriously and surrendered to the Babylonians, who took him and others to Babylon as captives (*Jer 22:24-30*; *2 Kgs 24:8-16*).\n\n
37:1	idm97289					 The focus now returns to Zedekiah, who succeeded his nephew Jehoiachin as king of Judah. These chapters record encounters between Zedekiah and Jeremiah that make plain Zedekiah’s inability to commit himself wholeheartedly to God’s word (cp. *Deut 10:12-13*). Zedekiah is a classic example of a “person with divided loyalty” (*Jas 1:6-8*).\n\n
37:1	idm97297					 These verses summarize Zedekiah’s reign and his entire response to the Lord’s messages through Jeremiah.\n\n
37:3	idm97303					 In asking for prayer, **Zedekiah** apparently hoped that Jeremiah’s petitions would magically defeat the enemy (see *14:7-9* and *corresponding study note*).\n\n
37:5	idm97312					 The Babylonians began their **siege of Jerusalem** in 588 BC. But they left Jerusalem because **the army of Pharaoh Hophra** was coming to help **Judah**. The Babylonians hoped to block and defeat the Egyptians, which they did.\n\n
37:6	idm97322					 The Lord answered Jeremiah’s prayer (*37:3*) with a warning for Zedekiah. The Egyptians would provide no lasting help, and the Babylonians would return to destroy Jerusalem—a prophecy that was fulfilled in 586 BC.\n\n
37:11	idm97330					 When the Babylonians went to face the Egyptians, Jeremiah decided to walk three miles north to his hometown, Anathoth, **to claim his share of the property among his relatives there.** He wanted to see his newly purchased property (*32:1-25*).\n\n
37:13	idm97338					 **The sentry** and other **officials** of Judah misinterpreted Jeremiah’s action as desertion.\n\n
37:17	idm97346					 By asking Jeremiah about other **messages from the** Lord*,* the king indicated that he was fearful of the future and still hoped that the Lord would defeat the Babylonians. Jeremiah answered quickly and emphatically that there was no hope for the kind of divine intervention that had destroyed the Assyrian army during Hezekiah’s reign (*2 Kgs 19:8-37*).\n\n
37:18	idm97356					 Jeremiah evidently assumed that Zedekiah was involved in his arrest and imprisonment. The prophet would have been in poor physical condition after being flogged and confined without medical treatment and with little food.\n\n
37:21	idm97362					 The king defied his officials and ordered the guards to keep Jeremiah in **the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace** under protective custody. Considering the scarcity of food during the long siege, **a loaf of fresh bread every day** was a generous ration.\n\n
38:1	idm97370					 Jeremiah was free to talk to people while he was in the prison courtyard. He repeated the Lord’s decrees of judgment, but this stirred fierce anger among some of the government officials. Zedekiah showed his cowardice by letting these men put Jeremiah in a muddy cistern; the king also had a courageous moment when he permitted a palace servant to rescue Jeremiah and return him to the palace prison.\n\n
38:1	idm97376					 The **Gedaliah** mentioned here had a different father than the Gedaliah in *40:6*. • The first **Pashhur** might have been the man in *20:1*. The second **Pashhur** had a different father.\n\n
38:4	idm97387					 The **officials** apparently believed that the **morale** of the **men** resisting the Babylonian army outside the walls of the city would be harmed if Jeremiah continued to prophesy, so they put him on trial for treason.\n\n
38:5	idm97396					 When the officials angrily confronted **King Zedekiah** and made their demands, he was weak and cowardly.\n\n
38:6	idm97403					 In the presence of everyone in the palace courtyard, Jeremiah was thrown into **an empty cistern**. At the bottom was **a thick layer of mud** that slowly enveloped Jeremiah’s body.\n\n
38:7	idm97411					 **the Ethiopian** (cp. *Luke 17:18*; *Acts 28:28*): Jeremiah’s rescuer was not from Judah; he was a foreigner who dared to defy the other officials. He ran to the **Benjamin Gate***,* where Jeremiah was first arrested (*Jer 37:11-13*), and rushed into the king’s presence without ceremony.\n\n
38:10	idm97423					 The rescue party included **thirty . . . men***,* perhaps indicating that Zedekiah felt the need to keep his officials from attacking it.\n\n
38:11	idm97431					 **Ebed-melech***,* the Ethiopian rescuer (*38:7*), was a caring person who wanted to protect Jeremiah’s weakened body as much as possible.\n\n
38:14	idm97440					 Zedekiah so desperately wanted a miracle to save his kingdom from the attacking Babylonian armies that he arranged a secret meeting with Jeremiah.\n\n
38:14	idm97446					 The location of **the third entrance of the** Lord**’s Temple** is not known. The gates of the Temple had small rooms nearby, so the private meeting probably took place in one of them.\n\n
38:17	idm97455					 Jeremiah laid out the Lord’s decree. Zedekiah could save the city by surrendering or he could watch as it was destroyed by the invaders.\n\n
38:19	idm97461					 Zedekiah still feared his fellow countrymen—this time, those who had **defected**—more than he feared the Lord or the **Babylonians***,* so he rejected Jeremiah’s advice. This was Jeremiah’s last message to the king.\n\n
38:20	idm97470					 Jeremiah reassured Zedekiah that everything would **go well** if Zedekiah chose to **obey the** Lord. If he refused, even his **friends** would abandon him.\n\n
38:24	idm97480					 When Zedekiah’s fear of his **officials** surfaced again, he demanded that Jeremiah keep secret what he had told the king. • The officials might have suspected that Zedekiah was about to surrender to the enemy. Jeremiah obeyed the king’s order to keep quiet, and he spent the final days of the siege in the palace prison under the king’s protection.\n\n
39:1	idm97487					 Just as Jeremiah had predicted (*34:1-7*), the Lord’s judgment fell on Zedekiah and the kingdom of Judah. For other accounts of this event, see *52:4-16*; *2 Kgs 25:1-21*; *2 Chr 36:11-21*; *Ezek 24:1-14*.\n\n
39:2	idm97498					 The Babylonian siege took a long time because the stone walls of Jerusalem were thick and the people’s resistance was strong.\n\n
39:3	idm97504					 High-ranking **officers** came into the city to oversee its destruction and **sat in triumph at the Middle Gate***,* showing how important this victory was to the Babylonians. According to custom, victorious officials positioned themselves at one of the gates, since judicial and administrative matters were controlled at gateways.\n\n
39:4	idm97513					 The steep slopes of the Kidron Valley on the east side and the Ben-Hinnom Valley on the west and south sides of Jerusalem forced the Babylonian army to concentrate their men to the north. This made it possible for Zedekiah, his family, and his officials to slip out of the south end of the city, cross the Kidron Valley, and travel up and over the Mount of Olives. Although they made this move after **nightfall***,* the noise of their departure alerted Babylonian sentries, and soldiers were soon chasing them.\n\n
39:5	idm97521					 Zedekiah and his royal party fled on foot, so it was not difficult for strong and healthy soldiers to capture the group near **Jericho**. The enemy troops then forced their captives to walk more than 200 miles north to **Riblah***,* where **King Nebuchadnezzar** had his field headquarters.\n\n
39:6	idm97531					 Zedekiah’s last sight was the slaughter of **his sons** and **all the nobles of Judah**. Their slaughter ensured that Zedekiah’s rule could never continue.\n\n
39:7	idm97539					 After Nebuchadnezzar **gouged out Zedekiah’s eyes***,* Zedekiah had to walk 400 miles to **Babylon***,* blinded, in great pain, and with his arms **in bronze chains**.\n\n
39:9	idm97550					 **took as exiles to Babylon the rest of the people:** The usual practice in that time was to tie a person’s hands together, and then tie him or her to the person in front, making a long line of grief-stricken captives.\n\n
39:11	idm97557					 These chapters describe the events that followed the destruction of Jerusalem, especially as they affected Jeremiah.\n\n
39:11	idm97563					 It is not fully known how Jeremiah and his urging the king to surrender to Babylon came to Nebuchadnezzar’s attention. Perhaps it was through the messages that Jeremiah sent to the exiles (ch *29*; see *40:2-3*).\n\n
39:15	idm97571					 **Ebed-melech** had saved Jeremiah from death in the muddy cistern (*38:7-13*). This promise was a solemn decree (see *study note on 2:2*).\n\n
40:1	idm97580					 This passage provides some details about what happened to Jeremiah immediately after the fall of Jerusalem.\n\n
40:2	idm97586					 **The captain of the guard** quoted the prediction of **the** Lord through Jeremiah that had now been fulfilled.\n\n
40:6	idm97595					 Gedaliah’s new headquarters were in **Mizpah**, eight miles north of the ruined Jerusalem.\n\n
40:7	idm97602					 The new government was organized under Gedaliah, who belonged to a family of high rank. His grandfather Shaphan had taken King Josiah the scroll of the law that sparked reformation (*2 Kgs 22:10*). Gedaliah’s father, Ahikam, had held a high post in Jehoiakim’s close circle of officials, and he had saved Jeremiah’s life (*Jer 26:24*).\n\n
40:7	idm97610					 News spread swiftly among the **Judean guerrilla bands** and the **poor people who were left behind** about Gedaliah’s appointment as governor. A small group of guerrilla leaders arranged to meet with Gedaliah in order to gain a better understanding of the new governor’s plans.\n\n
40:9	idm97618					 Gedaliah did his best to assure the Judean guerrillas that peaceful settlement under the rule of the **Babylonians** would bring prosperity.\n\n
40:11	idm97625					 The new governor’s promises encouraged people of Judah who had **fled** to neighboring countries to move back to their land. The mention of a **great harvest** indicates that the Babylonians had not destroyed the crops when they laid siege to Jerusalem.\n\n
40:14	idm97633					 **Ammon** was a small highland nation east of the Jordan Valley. • **Ishmael son of Nethaniah** had royal blood in his veins (*2 Kgs 25:25*).\n\n
40:16	idm97642					 Gedaliah’s response betrayed his naiveté and the lack of trust in advisers that infected the whole chaotic situation.\n\n
41:1	idm97648					 **in midautumn:** These events took place three months after the fall of Jerusalem. • **While they were eating together:** With this attack, Ishmael viciously violated Gedaliah’s hospitality.\n\n
41:4	idm97656					 The murderers kept their deed secret until the **next day***,* when men from **Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria** to the north arrived on their way south to the ruins of Jerusalem. Their appearance and the offerings they carried indicated that they were on their way to plead for mercy from the Lord (*Lev 2:1*; *14:2-9*). The annual Festival of Shelters was held at this time of year at the Temple (*Lev 23:33-36*), and the **eighty** worshipers were probably unarmed.\n\n
41:8	idm97669					 The surviving **ten** men had quick wits and saved their lives by promising to provide what Ishmael’s men needed most: **wheat, barley, olive oil, and honey**.\n\n
41:9	idm97677					 **dug by King Asa when he fortified Mizpah:** See *2 Chr 16:1-6*. That passage does not refer to cisterns, but the need for water and grain storage would have required such structures, and several cisterns have been found in the ruins of the city.\n\n
41:10	idm97685					 Some of **the king’s daughters** somehow escaped being killed or taken into exile.\n\n
41:11	idm97692					 **Johanan** and his companions learned of Gedaliah’s death in time to attack Ishmael’s party at the **pool near Gibeon***,* which was only a few miles south of Mizpah.\n\n
41:16	idm97701					 **Johanan** had with him a variety of important people, including **soldiers, women, children, and court officials.**\n\n
41:17	idm97709					 The group led by Johanan headed south, past the ruins of Jerusalem to **Geruth-kimham***,* a small village **near Bethlehem**. During this trip, the leaders decided that they would be safe from Babylonian reprisals if they fled to **Egypt**. The **Babylonians** were cruel, and no one trusted them to seek out the true culprit in Gedaliah’s death.\n\n
42:1	idm97720					 The party of Judean guerrillas and the people they had rescued (*41:16*) came to Jeremiah with what sounded like a sincere request for guidance.\n\n
42:4	idm97727					 The first phrase, **All right** (literally *I heard*), indicates that Jeremiah questioned the sincerity of the Judean group led by Johanan. Still, the prophet agreed to **pray** for divine guidance and to give them the full content of the Lord’s answer.\n\n
42:5	idm97736					 Perhaps these people sensed that Jeremiah doubted their sincerity. They responded by making a solemn oath: They committed to obey the Lord’s instructions and to submit to punishment if they failed to keep the oath. They were confident that the Lord’s answer would be what they wanted to hear.\n\n
42:10	idm97742					 The Lord replied that he wanted the people to stay in Judea and settle down, and he would plant them in the land (see *1:10*). Judea’s time of judgment was over. • **For I am with you and will save you:** The Lord was calling the remnant of Judea to trust him for protection against **the king of Babylon**.\n\n
42:13	idm97751					 Jeremiah had already prophesied Egypt’s destiny; it would be destroyed by the Babylonians (*46:2-26*). This **remnant of Judah** would walk into the path of the Lord’s judgment if they continued on **to Egypt**.\n\n
42:21	idm97760					 Like their ancestors, this group of people from Judah trusted in the Egyptians to protect them, rather than in the Lord.\n\n
43:1	idm97766					 Johanan and the rest of the people betrayed their oath (*42:20*) when they chose not to trust in the Lord’s answer through Jeremiah.\n\n
43:3	idm97773					 It is not known why **Baruch** was blamed.\n\n
43:7	idm97780					 The **city of Tahpanhes** (*2:16*; *Ezek 30:18*), now known as Tell Dafneh, guarded the road entering Egypt at its northeast corner.\n\n
43:10	idm97789					 **Nebuchadnezzar:** Cp. *42:2-22*; *Ezek 29:19-20*. According to an Akkadian inscription, Nebuchadnezzar invaded Egypt in 568–567 BC, less than twenty years after Jeremiah’s message.\n\n
43:12	idm97799					 In the ancient Near East, **temples** and **idols** were regarded as power centers, so successful invaders usually destroyed them.\n\n
43:13	idm97807					 The **sacred pillars** were highly prized by the ancient Egyptians. • **in the temple of the sun:** Or *in Heliopolis.* The sun was the supreme deity of the Egyptian religion. The ruins of this city are about six miles northeast of modern Cairo.\n\n
44:1	idm97816					 After their arrival in Egypt, the refugees of Judah scattered throughout the country. **Migdol** was a fortress near **Tahpanhes** in the northeastern corner of **Egypt**. **Memphis** was the original capital of Egypt. It became the religious center of northern Egypt, and its ruins are located on the west side of the Nile River, about thirteen miles southwest of Cairo. Some refugees had already moved to **southern Egypt***,* following the Nile River upstream.\n\n
44:2	idm97828					 Jeremiah’s message appealed to the common knowledge he and his audience shared about the **calamity** that had wiped out **Judah** and **Jerusalem**.\n\n
44:3	idm97837					 Since the Exodus, worship of false **gods** had been forbidden in Israel.\n\n
44:9	idm97844					 These Judean refugees had learned nothing; they had already forgotten their former sins and how God had judged them.\n\n
44:11	idm97850					 The Lord pronounced a death sentence, backed by the authority of his own name.\n\n
44:12	idm97856					 Unlike those exiled to Babylon, to whom the Lord had given hope (see *33:7-18*; *Ezek 34:12-15*; *36:24-31*), this **remnant of Judah** had no future.\n\n
44:15	idm97866					 The people did not accept Jeremiah’s pronouncement of judgment; they had abandoned even the pretense of serving the Lord (*42:1-3*) and were completely committed to idolatry.\n\n
44:15	idm97873					 This group of Judeans had probably gathered to observe a pagan festival.\n\n
44:17	idm97879					 The Judean refugees imagined that they had freedom. They apparently believed that obedience to the Lord entailed bondage and that their pagan worship was the way to fulfillment. • The **Queen of Heaven** was worshiped under a variety of names throughout the ancient Near East. In Assyria and Babylon she was called “Ishtar,” and the Canaanites called her “Astarte.” In the Old Testament, she is usually called “Ashtoreth” and associated with Baal. Solomon worshiped Ashtoreth and built shrines for her, but Josiah eventually destroyed those shrines (*2 Kgs 23:13*; see *1 Kgs 11:5*). Ashtoreth was associated with the planet Venus and with all types of reproduction among plants and animals, so she was a popular idol among farmers and herdsmen. Offerings of incense, food, and liquids were regarded as magical triggers that would induce reproduction and prosperity.\n\n
44:18	idm97888					 These Judeans believed that worshiping the **Queen of Heaven** provided prosperity and that ceasing to worship her would cause **war and famine** (cp. *Hos 2:8*). Their mindset was completely pagan.\n\n
44:20	idm97897					 This group of Judeans in Egypt had severed themselves from all meaningful relationship with the one true God of Israel; they were condemned to death.\n\n
44:20	idm97903					 The destruction of Judah and Jerusalem had not been due to the Lord’s inability to provide prosperity; rather, he **could no longer bear all the disgusting things** the people **were doing**.\n\n
44:24	idm97911					 The Lord released the people to serve the Queen of Heaven; they would bear the consequences of their decision (cp. *Rom 1:24*, *28*).\n\n
44:26	idm97919					 The **Judeans** in **Egypt** were now forever free of covenant obligations to the Lord. They were also banned from covenant protection. They chose to sever their relationship with the one true God of Israel, so they retained no privileges—they could not pray or make oaths in God’s name. Still, the Lord would not be absent from their lives, because he would see to it that **disaster** plagued them. Those who individually turned to the Lord in repentance would enjoy salvation and blessings. Even in Egypt, a small remnant of people trusted in the Lord (e.g., Jeremiah and Baruch).\n\n
44:30	idm97928					 **Pharaoh Hophra** was killed by **his enemies** in Egypt in 570 BC. • This verse concludes the record of Jeremiah’s forty-year ministry. Nothing is known about where, when, or how Jeremiah died.\n\n
45:1	idm97937					 This chapter is dated 605 BC, more than two decades prior to the preceding chapters. Jeremiah’s secretary, Baruch, was **overwhelmed with trouble***,* and the Lord promised him safety.\n\n
45:1	idm97946					 This event occurred during the same year that Baruch spent long hours in a hiding place, where he wrote down the messages the Lord had given to Jeremiah (*36:1-4*).\n\n
45:3	idm97953					 Jehoiakim had threatened to kill both Jeremiah and Baruch, which forced the prophet and the scribe into hiding. Baruch was physically exhausted, and he felt sorry for himself.\n\n
45:5	idm97959					 Baruch could depend on divine protection, no matter what trouble came his way. The several chapters preceding this one show that the Lord fulfilled this promise. Baruch was with Jeremiah when they were taken to Egypt.\n\n
46:1	idm97965					 This series of messages is directed toward foreign nations (see *1:5*, *10*, and similar messages in *Isa 13–23*; *Ezek 25–32*; *Amos 1:3–2:3*). Through Nebuchadnezzar, the Lord was going to judge all the nations from the Euphrates River to Egypt for their rebellion and sins against him (cp. *Lev 18:24-25*). Ultimately, Babylon would also come under God’s judgment (*Jer 50–51*). These chapters were probably written while Jeremiah and Baruch were in hiding (*36:27-32*). Among the pronouncements of doom on the foreign nations for their sins are a few statements of hope for salvation. Collections of oracles against the nations are also found in Isaiah (*Isa 13–23*) and Ezekiel (*Ezek 25–32*). Although God used surrounding nations to punish his rebellious people, those nations were also held accountable for their actions. The Lord is not only the God of Israel; he is the God of the entire world.\n\n
46:2	idm97981					 Jeremiah used the results of a battle known to Jehoiakim to warn him and the people of Jerusalem that Egypt could not protect them from Babylon. **Pharaoh Neco** had thought that the time was ripe to become the dominant power in the ancient Near East, so he moved north in 609 BC. After Neco spent several years trying to help fragments of the Assyrian army stop the westward movements of the Babylonian army, he was soundly defeated at **Carchemish** on the **Euphrates River** in 605 BC. Soon after that, the Babylonian army surrounded Jerusalem and forced Jehoiakim to become a vassal of Babylon.\n\n
46:3	idm97992					 Military commands such as these would have been issued when the soldiers were excited, well armed, and ready to fight.\n\n
46:7	idm97998					 In spite of Pharaoh Neco’s **boasting** and the imposing presence of his soldiers, his tactics did not confuse the enemy or win the battle (cp. *1 Kgs 20:11*).\n\n
46:9	idm98006					 The Lord had decreed that **Egypt** would lose the battle, so allies would be of little help. The battle of Carchemish was pivotal to the rise of Babylon as the great empire of the area.\n\n
46:11	idm98013					 **Gilead** was known as a source of healing plants (cp. *8:22*).\n\n
46:13	idm98021					 The defeat at Carchemish created chaos in Egypt and among its armies. The Lord was executing judgment on Egypt.\n\n
46:15	idm98027					 The Lord filled the Egyptian soldiers with fear, and no one could keep them in military order as they fled from Carchemish through Canaan to their Egyptian homes. Back in **Egypt***,* they would become strong critics of **Pharaoh** Neco and say that he was **a loudmouth**.\n\n
46:18	idm98037					 **Mount Tabor** towers over the eastern part of the Jezreel Valley. **Mount Carmel** rises above the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n
46:19	idm98045					 **Memphis will be destroyed:** This happened in 568–567 BC, when Nebuchadnezzar invaded Egypt.\n\n
46:21	idm98053					 Egypt depended on hired **mercenaries** from other countries who had no interest in dying for **Egypt**. Under threat, they would **turn and run**.\n\n
46:22	idm98062					 The picture of **a serpent gliding away** illustrates the panic that gripped Egypt. The invaders would chop the people to pieces **like woodsmen** after swarming into the country like **locusts**.\n\n
46:25	idm98071					 **Amon** was a fertility god worshiped in **Thebes***,* the capital of Southern Egypt. Amon’s idol, in the form of a ram, represented the sun. The Egyptians thought that this god was very powerful, but like all the other deities of Egypt, it would be destroyed by the all-powerful God of Israel. The **Pharaoh***,* who claimed to be the son of the sun-god, would suffer the same fate. • **the land will recover:** In 601 BC, Nebuchadnezzar attacked Egypt, did great damage, and then withdrew. He invaded the land again in 568–567 BC (*43:8-13*; *Ezek 29:19*).\n\n
46:27	idm98087					 **I will bring you home again:** The exiles began returning to Judea in 538 BC. Israel was disciplined but not destroyed.\n\n
47:1	idm98095					 This message from the Lord was directed against the Philistine cities along the southeastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea and their allies farther north. The Lord had determined that these cities would be destroyed in connection with the Babylonian invasion of the area.\n\n
47:2	idm98101					 **A flood:** This metaphor depicts the movement of the Babylonian armies into the coastal area, beginning in 609 BC and peaking in 605 BC (cp. *1:11-14*).\n\n
47:4	idm98111					 **The time has come . . . the** Lord** is destroying:** The Lord controlled what would happen, as well as when events would occur. • The **Philistines** had come into the southeastern coastal areas **from the island of Crete** between 1200 and 1100 BC. The northern cities, **Tyre and Sidon***,* were colonized at about the same time by distant cousins of the Philistines who mixed with the native Canaanites.\n\n
47:5	idm98125					 **Gaza** was a major Philistine city. • **head shaved bald:** The city’s people expressed their grief by following this ritual (cp. *Isa 15:2*; *Mic 1:16*). • **Ashkelon***,* another Philistine city a few miles north on the coast, would be emptied.\n\n
47:6	idm98137					 **O sword of the** Lord**:** God used the Babylonians to enact his justice. This request might have come from the Philistine cities being attacked by the Babylonians. The people were eager for the attacks against them to stop.\n\n
47:7	idm98146					 The punishment would not end soon, because the judge had declared his judgment and his **mission** had to be accomplished: **Ashkelon . . . must be destroyed**.\n\n
48:1	idm98154					 The Lord decreed the destruction and future restoration of Moab and Ammon, the two nations descended from Lot, Abraham’s nephew (*Gen 19:36-38*).\n\n
48:1	idm98161					 Moab, one of two nations descended from Abraham’s nephew Lot (*Gen 19:36-38*), was the next nation brought to trial in the Lord’s courtroom (cp. *Isa 15–16*). Moab’s territory lay between the Arnon River and the Zered Brook east of the Dead Sea. At the time, the Moabites felt self-assured because they were relatively free from the military reach of the Babylonians. However, the Lord found the Moabites to be greedy and cruel, and their worship was vicious and sensuous.\n\n
48:1	idm98169					 The powerful Judge, **the God of Israel** (see *study note on 2:2*), introduced the indictments and decrees against Moab. • The **city of Nebo** was on the side of Mount Nebo (*Num 32:3*, *38*), several miles east of the north end of the Dead Sea. • The **city of Kiriathaim** was built by the tribe of Reuben (*Josh 13:19*) in the highlands east of the Dead Sea.\n\n
48:2	idm98182					 **Heshbon** was located between the Jabbok and Arnon rivers, east of the Dead Sea. • **Madmen** was apparently another name for Dibon, a town near Heshbon; it would also be destroyed.\n\n
48:3	idm98190					 Little is known about the village of **Horonaim** (see *Isa 15:5*); it was probably situated near the southeastern shore of the Dead Sea.\n\n
48:5	idm98198					 **Luhith** was another small village near Horonaim. The sorrows of oppression would reach into the smallest places.\n\n
48:7	idm98205					 The people of Moab bragged about their **wealth and skill***,* but their most serious sin was devotion to a deity named **Chemosh***;* this false god represented the magical power of reproduction, but it would become clear that Chemosh was powerless.\n\n
48:8	idm98215					 The Lord sentenced all the **towns** of **Moab** to destruction, and he warned the agents of his judgment to faithfully carry out his decree.\n\n
48:11	idm98223					 **Moab** had a long history of relative **peace** and a culture that its people highly valued. Vineyards were plentiful in Moab. After the juice was squeezed from the grapes, the **wine** was stored in clay flasks until it became **fragrant and smooth**.\n\n
48:13	idm98233					 The Lord’s judgment would make the Moabites **ashamed** that **Chemosh** was unable to protect them from harm, just as the Israelites of the northern kingdom were ashamed that the false gods they worshiped in apostasy were not able to protect them from the Assyrians (*1 Kgs 12:28-29*; *13:33-34*; *Hos 8:5-6*). • **ashamed of their gold calf at Bethel:** See *1 Kgs 12:28-30*.\n\n
48:18	idm98246					 **Dibon** and nearby **Aroer** were key Moabite cities.\n\n
48:20	idm98254					 When the news spread that **Moab** lay **in ruins, disgraced** and **destroyed***,* panic would rapidly increase in the **Arnon** Valley.\n\n
48:21	idm98265					 Eleven Moabite villages would soon hear that **the strength** of Moab’s **arm** was **broken**. This meant that the villages had no one to defend them against the advancing enemy.\n\n
48:26	idm98274					 Moab’s hatred for Israel was ultimately **against the** Lord.\n\n
48:31	idm98282					 The Lord had to punish **Moab** and other nations that sinned, but it caused him to **mourn**. • **Kir-hareseth** was Moab’s capital city.\n\n
48:32	idm98291					 **Sibmah** and **Jazer** were conquered and rebuilt by the tribe of Reuben (*Num 32:3*, *38*; *Josh 13:19*), who transformed the high plateau east of **the Dead Sea** into vineyards.\n\n
48:34	idm98303					 These verses describe the effects of the Lord’s judgment on the Moabite people. • The Moabite towns listed here were located along the small rivers that flow from the east into the Dead Sea.\n\n
48:35	idm98309					 The Moabites expressed their sorrow and grief with customary actions; they shaved their **heads and beards***,* cut their **hands***,* and used **burlap** for clothing (*41:5*; *Job 1:20*).\n\n
48:39	idm98322					 The Lord’s judgment of **Moab** would cause nearby countries to realize that the same kind of ruin might be their punishment.\n\n
48:40	idm98329					 The **eagle** represents speed and surprise; its victim is caught and carried off before it is able to react.\n\n
48:43	idm98336					 Between the **terror** (Hebrew *pakhad*), the **traps** (Hebrew *pakhath*), and a **snare** (Hebrew *pakh*), there would be no escape for the people of Moab.\n\n
48:45	idm98348					 If the Moabites fled north, they would be met by their enemies at Heshbon. • **a fire comes from Heshbon:** Cp. *Num 21:28*.\n\n
48:47	idm98356					 The Lord would have mercy on Moab; he promised that the people would prosper at some time in the future.\n\n
49:1	idm98362					 Ammon was the next nation brought to trial in the Lord’s courtroom. Ammon was the second of Lot’s descendants (see *study note on 48:1-47*); its territory was north of Moab and east of Israel. The destruction of Ammon occurred shortly after the fall of Jerusalem.\n\n
49:1	idm98369					 After the fall of the northern kingdom of **Israel** in 722 BC, the Ammonites moved into territory that had been vacated by the tribe of **Gad**. • The Ammonites worshiped a fertility god named **Molech** (“ruler”), who was a lot like Baal (“master”).\n\n
49:2	idm98379					 **Rabbah***,* the capital of Ammon, was destroyed in 582 BC.\n\n
49:3	idm98388					 The Ammonites might have thought that their deity, **Molech***,* was powerful. However, the coming invader would take this idol into exile **with his priests and officials***;* their ritual magic would be exposed as a fraud.\n\n
49:4	idm98398					 The Ammonites **trusted in** their **wealth***,* but it could not provide security. The Lord ensured their judgment and their future restoration.\n\n
49:7	idm98407					 The people of **Edom** were descendants of Esau, Jacob’s brother (*Gen 32:3*). The land of Edom lay south of Moab, in the highlands rising east of the Arabah Valley. The divine Judge exercised his right to hold every nation accountable.\n\n
49:7	idm98415					 **Is there no wisdom:** Edom was famous for its wise men, but they would suddenly appear foolish because they were unaware of the coming doom. • **Teman** and **Dedan** were cities of Edom.\n\n
49:9	idm98424					 Harvesters customarily left some of the crop for the poor (*Lev 19:9-10*); **thieves** would take only those **grapes** they could get quickly and easily. The invaders would take their time and mercilessly **strip** Edom **bare***,* leaving only ruin behind them. However, the Lord promised to be merciful to the defeated nation’s **orphans** and **widows**.\n\n
49:12	idm98438					 The **cup of judgment** symbolized the fulfillment of the Lord’s decrees (see *25:15-17*). This section vividly depicts the aftermath of a nation’s drinking from that cup.\n\n
49:13	idm98446					 **Bozrah** was a fortress built on top of a high rock with steep sides, but no place in Edom would be safe.\n\n
49:14	idm98453					 The **ambassador** might have been an angel sent by God (cp. *1 Kgs 22:20-22*).\n\n
49:15	idm98461					 The leaders of Edom thought themselves powerful because they stirred **fear** in those who passed through their land on the King’s Highway. • Edom had a **rock fortress***,* now called Petra; it was hard to find and could only be approached through a deep, narrow gorge. Even this remote place could not secure the Edomites against the Lord’s judgment.\n\n
49:18	idm98470					 As had occurred with **the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah***,* Edom would become uninhabited.\n\n
49:19	idm98478					 In divine judgment, the Lord would use the Babylonians to **come like a lion . . . leaping on the sheep** as they chased Edom’s leaders out of the land. • The Lord’s rhetorical questions implied the answer, “No one **can challenge** the Lord; he is the only Almighty **ruler**.”\n\n
49:22	idm98487					 The **eagle***,* a common bird in the rugged mountains of Edom, is a metaphor for the rapid penetration of the region by the Babylonians.\n\n
49:23	idm98495					 **Damascus***,* the capital of Aram (ancient Syria), and the Aramean cities of **Hamath and Arpad***,* indicate Aram as the next object of the Lord’s judgment.\n\n
49:25	idm98505					 Damascus had a long history of power and glory at the hub of major trade routes. Its people enjoyed prosperity and **joy***,* but they would lose these pleasures when they were **forsaken** by the Lord.\n\n
49:27	idm98514					 The city’s **walls** and **palaces** were probably built with timbers from the slopes of Mount Hermon. • **Ben-hadad** (literally *son of the mighty one*) was the royal title given to a long line of Aramean kings.\n\n
49:28	idm98524					 The nomads of **Kedar** roamed freely in the upper Arabian Desert east of Palestine. They were a belligerent people (*Ps 120:5-7*; *Isa 21:13-16*) who raised flocks and herds for lucrative trade with Tyre (*Ezek 27:21*). • **Hazor** was a region east of Damascus inhabited by nomads. • The poem urges **King Nebuchadnezzar** to attack, and it describes the impact of the battles.\n\n
49:28	idm98536					 The Babylonians wanted to defeat **the warriors** of **Kedar** so they could capture their rich **household goods and camels**.\n\n
49:30	idm98545					 The Lord exhorted the **people of Hazor** to **run** and hide, even though it would do them no good. **Nebuchadnezzar***,* the Babylonian king, had them on his agenda for conquest.\n\n
49:34	idm98555					 The final poetic message of this series was addressed to **Elam**. This nation, known for its ferocity, was located in the Zagros Mountains, far to the east beyond Babylon (*Ezek 32:24*).\n\n
49:35	idm98563					 The Elamite warriors were expert **archers***,* but their skills could not save **Elam**.\n\n
49:36	idm98572					 The common aftermath of a successful invasion was for the victors to **scatter** the refugees far and wide.\n\n
49:37	idm98579					 The Lord would express his **fierce anger** through the **great disaster** to come upon **Elam**. No specific charge is mentioned here, but like other nations, Elam served false gods and was cruel in its wars against its neighbors.\n\n
49:38	idm98588					 **I will set my throne in Elam:** The Lord would express his supreme authority by destroying Elam’s **king and officials**.\n\n
49:39	idm98596					 The Lord’s decree of judgment was balanced by his promise to **restore the fortunes of Elam**. In 539 BC, a native of Elam named Cyrus conquered Babylon and founded the Persian Empire. Susa, the former capital of Elam, then became the capital of the Persian Empire (*Esth 1:2*). Cyrus would be God’s anointed instrument to set the Jews free (*Isa 44:28–45:1*).\n\n
50:1	idm98606					 This message of judgment on Babylon is the longest for any nation except Judah, and threats against Babylon are interwoven with promises for Judah’s restoration. Babylon was the Lord’s agent for destroying the other civilizations of the Near East, but it was also guilty of its own sins. The Lord would judge Babylon by doing to her what she had done to others (*50:15*).\n\n
50:2	idm98613					 Raising **a signal flag** was a favored method for warning that an enemy was approaching a city (cp. *Isa 13:2*). • The people of Babylon would be under divine judgment because they worshiped the **gods Bel** (the Babylonian name for *Baal*) and **Marduk** (the Babylonian deity of wind, storm, and fertility).\n\n
50:3	idm98624					 The **nation . . . from the north** was the Persian nation led by Cyrus in 539 BC. Persia was east of Babylon, but it first struck Babylonia in the north and then moved south. The attack destroyed the powerful Babylonian Empire.\n\n
50:4	idm98632					 This poetic interlude was a message of hope for the Israelite exiles in Babylon in contrast to the judgment and oppression they had been experiencing. The divine Judge is also the divine Savior.\n\n
50:4	idm98638					 **In those coming days:** In 538, 458, and 445 BC, some exiles of Israel moved back to their homeland. • The people of **Israel** and **Judah** would **come weeping** with joy and repentance, choosing to worship **the** Lord** their God** instead of worshiping idols.\n\n
50:5	idm98652					 **an eternal covenant:** See *31:23-34*.\n\n
50:6	idm98660					 The **shepherds** of Israel and Judah, such as Jeroboam I and Manasseh (see *1 Kgs 12:25–13:34*; *2 Kgs 21:1-18*), had led the people away from the Lord. • The **mountains** were both literal and metaphorical—Baal worship tended to take place at high elevations.\n\n
50:7	idm98670					 This verse continues the metaphor of lost sheep (*50:6*), connecting Israel’s vulnerability to attack with their apostasy in turning away from the Lord. **Their enemies** rationalized their mistreatment of Israel by saying that the Israelites had **sinned against the** Lord. These enemies understood that the Israelites’ **true place of rest** and **hope** was in the Lord.\n\n
50:8	idm98682					 The Lord urged the Israelites to leave when he ordered **an army of great nations** (Persia and its allies) to **attack Babylon** in 539 BC.\n\n
50:11	idm98691					 These verses describe in vivid detail the defeat of Babylon by the Persian invasion (see ch *51*; *Isa 13:14*; *21:1-10*; *44:28*; *47:1-5*; *Dan 5*). Babylon was never an important kingdom again. The city of Babylon was leveled in 485 BC. Archaeological excavation of Babylon began in 1899, and the remains of Babylon were brought to light over several decades.\n\n
50:11	idm98704					 **rejoice . . . frisk about:** The Babylonians had been light-hearted and carefree because they had **plundered** the Lord’s **people** in Jerusalem. They gave no thought to the well-being of those they conquered.\n\n
50:12	idm98713					 The divine Judge rendered his verdict, describing the **disgrace** of a defeated Babylon.\n\n
50:14	idm98720					 The Lord ordered armies **to attack Babylon** with a multitude of **arrows***,* the artillery of that age. • **she has sinned against the** Lord**:** The primary charge leveled against other nations was also directed toward **Babylon**.\n\n
50:15	idm98733					 The Lord’s judgment was fulfilled when Babylon surrendered and her **walls** fell. **The** Lord**’s vengeance** carried out justice by doing to Babylon what **she** had **done to others** (cp. *Deut 19:21*; *Luke 6:38*).\n\n
50:16	idm98747					 As Babylon fell, farmers fled and left their **crops** behind. The slaughter on the battlefield caused the people to **run away**.\n\n
50:17	idm98755					 Another poetic interlude laments Israel’s sufferings and promises future restoration.\n\n
50:17	idm98761					 **Assyria** conquered the northern kingdom of Israel in 734–722 BC, and **Nebuchadnezzar** conquered the southern kingdom of Judah in 605–586 BC.\n\n
50:18	idm98771					 **Therefore:** This word introduces two divine decrees. The first decree condemned **Babylon** to complete annihilation, like the punishment the Lord gave Assyria (*Nah 3*). Assyria fell in 612 BC; Babylon fell in 539 BC. • **I will bring Israel home:** The second divine decree promises restoration for Israel, specifically the people of the northern tribes, whose land was defined by the indicated landmarks. • **Carmel** is a mountain range close to the Mediterranean Sea in the northwestern corner of Israel. • **Bashan** was a region in the highlands rising east of the Sea of Galilee. • The tribe of **Ephraim** occupied the **hill country** in the central part of Israel west of the Jordan River. • **Gilead** was a highland area that rose on the east side of the Jordan River, opposite Ephraim.\n\n
50:20	idm98788					 The Lord would **forgive the remnant** of people from **Israel** and **Judah***;* they would seek the Lord as they returned to their homeland (*50:4-5*; see chs *31*, *33*).\n\n
50:21	idm98801					 The judgments against Babylon continue. The divine Judge is also portrayed as the divine commander of the armies. The Persians were the Lord’s **warriors** against Babylon, just as Babylon had been his warriors against Judah (*25:9*). • **Merathaim** (literally *double rebellion*) refers to the southern part of the Tigris and Euphrates river valley. **Pekod** (literally *punishment*) designates a people living on the eastern side of the same valley. These people were Babylonian. • **completely destroy:** See *Lev 27:28-29*; *Josh 6:21*; *1 Sam 15:3*.\n\n
50:28	idm98817					 The exiles returning to Jerusalem would be able to encourage those left behind that the enemy had been punished as God had promised and that his promised restoration of Israel was beginning.\n\n
50:29	idm98823					 Skilled **archers** would kill the Babylonian **soldiers** even as those soldiers had **killed** their victims in battle. This was the Lord’s way of judging the ruthless empire builders who had **defied** the one true God by worshiping other deities (*50:38*).\n\n
50:31	idm98834					 Because of the Lord’s decree, the **arrogant** Babylonian Empire would never rise again as a mighty power in the world.\n\n
50:33	idm98841					 **The people of Israel and Judah** had suffered greatly. The Lord’s act of redemption would **defend them** and **give them rest again in Israel**. God is **strong***,* and he is as able to redeem as he is to punish.\n\n
50:35	idm98852					 Babylon would experience exactly the kind of violence it had meted out. The same charges were brought against **Babylon** as were brought against Israel, Judah, Egypt, and their neighbors. All of them worshiped **idols** instead of the one true God. • **The sword of destruction** refers to the Persian army.\n\n
50:38	idm98861					 The Euphrates River ran through the city of Babylon, providing its **water supply**. The Persians were reputed to have diverted the river during the siege by digging a canal around the city walls and then attacking through the riverbed.\n\n
50:39	idm98868					 The doom of **Babylon** would be like the utter desolation of **Sodom and Gomorrah** (*Gen 19:24-25*).\n\n
50:43	idm98877					 The Babylonians would experience the same terror their own victims had felt (cp. *6:22-23*).\n\n
50:44	idm98884					 These verses essentially repeat *49:19-21*, with **Babylon** in place of Edom.\n\n
51:1	idm98892					 The **destroyer** selected by the Lord was Persia, led by Cyrus, who came **against Babylon** in 539 BC.\n\n
51:3	idm98901					 God took the role of commander and ordered the destroyer to wipe out **the Babylonians**. • **completely destroyed:** See *Lev 27:28-29*; *1 Sam 15:3*.\n\n
51:5	idm98911					 Although the Israelites had committed many sins **against the Holy One***,* he was **still their God***,* and he planned to save them.\n\n
51:6	idm98921					 The Israelites were urged to **flee from Babylon** at the appropriate **time** to avoid being caught up in the Lord’s **vengeance** against Babylon (cp. *50:8*).\n\n
51:7	idm98931					 **Babylon** had been **a gold cup***,* a vessel of unusual power and wealth that the Lord had used for a time to rule every nation in the ancient Near East. • **The nations drank Babylon’s wine:** All those nations had suffered greatly under Babylon’s heavy hand.\n\n
51:8	idm98941					 Jeremiah foresaw the collapse of the Babylonian Empire. Although the Lord was carrying out justice, the event called for mourning.\n\n
51:9	idm98947					 **Nothing** could **save** Babylon; **her punishment** could not **be measured**. After Babylon collapsed, it would be time for the exiles to **return** home, where they could tell others of God’s wonderful acts on their behalf.\n\n
51:11	idm98958					 The **kings of the Medes** included Cyrus, who marched against Babylon and overthrew it in 539 BC.\n\n
51:15	idm98966					 This anthem of praise affirms the Lord’s uniqueness and majesty. It contrasts the reality of the one true God with the emptiness of idols.\n\n
51:15	idm98972					 As the Creator and preserver of all things, God, not Baal, controls the storm with its **thunder***,*** rain, lightning***,* and **wind**. The Lord can use these forces whenever he desires.\n\n
51:20	idm98983					 **You:** The Lord had chosen and empowered King Cyrus of Persia to turn the Babylonian Empire to dust.\n\n
51:27	idm98990					 **Ararat** was the mountainous region north of **Babylon**. • **Ashkenaz** was Noah’s great-grandson through Japheth and Gomer (*Gen 10:2-3*); his descendants probably lived in Ararat, as did the people of **Minni***,* who are otherwise unknown.\n\n
51:29	idm99002					 The terrible fall of **Babylon** happened just as the Lord had planned. The Babylonian soldiers lost all desire to **fight***,* and the Persian invaders quickly penetrated the city walls.\n\n
51:31	idm99011					 This **king** was Nabonidus; at the time, he was at Borsippa, north of Babylon. His son Belshazzar was regent in Babylon. See *Dan 5:1-30*.\n\n
51:33	idm99019					 The wealth of the city was likened to **wheat on a threshing floor***;* the looting of Babylon was like a **harvest**.\n\n
51:35	idm99028					 **Make Babylon suffer as she made us suffer:** See “*Prayers for Vengeance*” Theme Note.\n\n
51:36	idm99036					 **I will be your lawyer:** In response to the people’s request (*51:35*), the Lord would prosecute Babylon for its brutal sins.\n\n
51:37	idm99044					 The looting of the city and the damage to its structures would inspire **contempt** rather than awe in its visitors.\n\n
51:38	idm99051					 The Lord proclaimed that he would use **wine** to turn the **lion** that once terrorized and destroyed nations (*5:6*; *25:38*; *49:19*) into an easily subdued lamb. Wine as an instrument of wrath was usually figurative (*25:15-29*), but here it was literal (see *Dan 5*).\n\n
51:42	idm99064					 **The sea** represents the armies that overwhelmed **Babylon**. The **crashing waves** symbolize the assault against the city.\n\n
51:44	idm99073					 The defeat of its chief deity, **Bel***,* was the ultimate disaster for **Babylon**. This idol’s lavish adornments would be taken away, and its supposed power would be exposed as a monumental fraud.\n\n
51:45	idm99082					 The Lord was concerned about the spiritual and physical well-being of the Jewish exiles in Babylon, where their political situation was perilous. The Lord pointed to the future, when the exiles would be redeemed from disgrace and return with great joy to live in their own land.\n\n
51:45	idm99088					 As the Lord described the terrors of his angry judgment against **Babylon***,*, he pointed his people to their homeland to assure them of their safety.\n\n
51:46	idm99096					 **Violence will erupt:** As an enemy army headed toward Babylon, the leaders inside the city were blaming **each other**. Vicious in-fighting was tearing Babylon apart.\n\n
51:47	idm99104					 The Lord’s punishment of **Babylon** would cause the **heavens and earth** to **rejoice** at this display of God’s justice.\n\n
51:49	idm99113					 Babylon’s penalty would match the brutality it had poured out on the Israelites and other nations.\n\n
51:51	idm99119					 The exiled people carried a heavy load of shame and disgrace for their past sins. The Lord**’s Temple** was **defiled** when the Babylonians destroyed it in 586 BC.\n\n
51:52	idm99129					 **Yes:** The Lord agreed with his people that their past was shameful, but he gave them hope for the future when Babylon’s power would be broken.\n\n
51:53	idm99136					 Babylon’s **fortifications** could not protect it; the city would certainly be plundered, for **the** Lord had **spoken** and decreed their punishment.\n\n
51:54	idm99146					 As **Babylon** was destroyed, the din of battle would be overwhelming. People would scream and yell, soldiers would shout their battle cries, and boulders would crash against each other as walls were torn down.\n\n
51:55	idm99153					 The destruction of **Babylon** was not a historical accident—**the** Lord was in control and would bring it to pass. • The **noise** (*51:54*) would dissolve into the **silence** of death. The invading army would kill or capture the Babylonian soldiers, and the population would flee into the countryside.\n\n
51:57	idm99165					 Belshazzar, the ruler of the city, and his **officers** had a feast at which drunkenness was dominant; it ended in their death (*Dan 5*).\n\n
51:59	idm99173					 Just as Babylon had destroyed Jerusalem, this great kingdom would itself be destroyed. This passage contains a message sent to Babylon seven years before the fall of Jerusalem.\n\n
51:59	idm99179					 **King Zedekiah** made a trip **to Babylon** to build trust between himself and Nebuchadnezzar. It was probably during this visit that Zedekiah swore an oath of loyalty to the Babylonian king (*2 Chr 36:13*).\n\n
51:63	idm99188					 Throwing **the scroll . . . into the Euphrates River** signaled the permanent destruction of **Babylon.**\n\n
52:1	idm99196					 This chapter repeats the narrative of *2 Kgs 24:18–25:30*, which recounts the final month of Jerusalem’s existence, with a few added details and changes. The repetition of this passage emphasizes Jeremiah’s integrity as a true prophet of Almighty God. Everything Jeremiah had predicted about the destruction of the holy city and the end of the kingdom of Judah came true. Likewise, everything that he predicted about the Exile, the sufferings of the exiled survivors in Babylon, and their return from exile, came true.\n\n
52:9	idm99203					 **Riblah***,* which Jeremiah recorded as being **in the land of Hamath** (see *39:5*), was several hundred miles north of Jerusalem.\n\n
52:10	idm99213					 **He also slaughtered all the officials of Judah at Riblah:** This sentence is an addition to the narrative in *2 Kgs 25:7*. Though the soldiers deserted **Zedekiah** as they fled to Jericho (*Jer 52:8*), the officials did not do so.\n\n
52:11	idm99223					 The last sentence of the verse is an addition to the *2 Kgs 25* text.\n\n
52:12	idm99230					 This section adds some details not found in *2 Kgs 25*. The Babylonians gained vast wealth by looting all the precious metals in the Temple before it was burned. • The Babylonian looters had to break large metal items into pieces in order to get them on wagons and carry them away. • **18 feet in circumference. They were hollow, with walls 3 inches thick:** These words are an addition to the *2 Kgs 25* text.\n\n
52:12	idm99239					 **On August 17 of that year:** This date is three days later than the one recorded in *2 Kgs 25:8*; the reason for the discrepancy is not known.\n\n
52:13	idm99247					 **He burned down the Temple:** Although the Temple was constructed mostly of stone, beams of cedar were laid among the stones. Cedar panels covered the walls, and cypress planks were used for the floors. Wood was also used for window frames and for doors (see *1 Kgs 6*). All of this wood burned.\n\n
52:15	idm99255					 **some of the poorest of the people:** Jeremiah added this phrase (cp. *2 Kgs 25:11*) and changed “population” to **craftsmen**.\n\n
52:17	idm99264					 This section includes a more detailed list of Temple furnishings than in *1 Kgs 6:1-38*.\n\n
52:21	idm99271					 Jeremiah added “and 18 feet in circumference” and the last sentence (cp. *2 Kgs 25:17*).\n\n
52:23	idm99278					 Jeremiah added this verse, which is not in *2 Kgs 25* (see *study note on 52:1-34*).\n\n
52:25	idm99286					 **seven:** The parallel in *2 Kgs 25:18* reads “five.”\n\n
52:28	idm99294					 The numbers in these verses amplify the data given in *2 Kgs 24:14-16* regarding the deportation of exiles in 597 BC. The deportation in *Jer 52:30* is not mentioned elsewhere in Scripture; it was probably a Babylonian reprisal for Gedaliah’s murder (*41:1-3*). This suggests that the person(s) responsible for making this adaptation lived after 581 BC, probably in Babylon.\n\n
52:28	idm99305					 The account in *2 Kgs 24:12-14* states that this event occurred in Nebuchadnezzar’s eighth year. This difference reflects two ancient Near Eastern methods of calculating the beginning of a king’s reign. In 2 Kings, the year in which Nebuchadnezzar ascended the throne is treated as the first year of his reign. Jeremiah apparently started counting the first *full* year as Nebuchadnezzar’s first year.\n\n
52:29	idm99313					 Nebuchadnezzar’s **eighteenth year** was 586 BC, the year Jerusalem was destroyed.\n\n
52:31	idm99321					 This paragraph repeats *2 Kgs 25:27-30*. This part of the narrative supplies the fulfillment of Jeremiah’s prediction of Jehoiachin’s future (see *Jer 22:24-30*). • **Evil-merodach** reigned in Babylon 561–560 BC. Several inscriptions found in a basement near Babylon’s Ishtar Gate tell of rations of food provided to Jehoiachin and his family.\n\n
