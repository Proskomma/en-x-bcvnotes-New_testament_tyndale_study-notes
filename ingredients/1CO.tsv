1:1	idm148764					 Paul commonly begins his letters with a few words about himself, followed by greetings and an invocation of grace and peace. In this, he follows the normal pattern of ancient Greek letters but expands it with Christian meaning.\n\n
1:1	idm148770					 **An apostle of Christ Jesus** was a missionary evangelist commissioned by Christ himself. • **Sosthenes***,* Paul’s co-worker, might be the same person as in *Acts 18:17*.\n\n
1:2	idm148780					 The **church** is comprised of those who are **called by God to be his own holy people***,* those who belong to him and are dedicated to him. They have been made holy **by means of Christ Jesus**—God has set them apart for himself through the saving work of his Son and their faith relationship to him.\n\n
1:3	idm148790					 **Grace and peace** represent traditional Greek and Hebrew greetings. **Grace** is undeserved blessing that comes from the kindness of God. **Peace** is a sense of well-being and contentedness, rooted in the Good News and brought about by the Holy Spirit (see *Gal 5:22*). Together, the phrase conveys things understood as gifts from God (see *Rom 5:1-2*).\n\n
1:4	idm148801					 Paul thanks God for the spiritual gifts he sees in the lives of the Corinthian Christians and expresses his confidence that God will keep them safe to the end.\n\n
1:4	idm148807					 **now that you belong to Christ Jesus** (literally *in Christ Jesus*): Paul frequently uses the phrase *in Christ Jesus* to refer to the saving relationship believers have with Christ (e.g., *Rom 3:24*; *Gal 2:4*; *Eph 3:6*).\n\n
1:5	idm148819					 **God** had **enriched** the Corinthian **church** spiritually, specifically in **eloquent words** and **knowledge**. This probably refers to the spiritual messages and understanding (see *1:7*) on which the church prided itself. *Word* and *knowledge* occur frequently in this letter: Paul acknowledges the abundant spiritual gifts that God has given the church in Corinth. Later, he corrects their distorted perspectives on these gifts (see *1:18–2:5*; *3:18-20*; *12:1–14:40*).\n\n
1:7	idm148836					 **every spiritual gift:** See *12:8-10*, *28*.\n\n
1:8	idm148845					 Even though believers are saved from eternal condemnation (see *Rom 8:1*), they remain accountable to God for the way they live (see *1 Cor 3:12-15*; *4:4-5*; *2 Cor 5:10*). Paul encourages his readers to live a holy life so that they will be found faultless when Christ returns (see *Phil 1:6*, *10*; *1 Thes 3:13*; *5:23-24*).\n\n
1:9	idm148859					 **God . . . is faithful:** See *10:13*; *Deut 7:9*; *1 Thes 5:24*. • **he has invited you:** God has chosen them and brought them **into partnership with his Son** (cp. *Rom 8:28-39*).\n\n
1:10	idm148872					 The body of the letter is devoted to Paul’s advice on specific problems and questions that had arisen in the Corinthian church.\n\n
1:10	idm148878					 The Corinthian believers were arguing over which of the leading evangelists (Paul, Apollos, Peter) was best. Paul rebukes them for their quarreling and worldly comparisons. As a minister of Christ and the Good News, he and the others are all channels through whom God works (see *3:1–4:7*).\n\n
1:10	idm148885					 **dear brothers and sisters:** Literally *brothers.* This generic, traditional term of affection is used to address members of the same family, both male and female. • **I appeal to you:** Paul motivates them **by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ***,* not by his own authority. • **authority** (literally *name*): In Jewish thought, a person’s name carried the weight of the person’s authority and reputation. • **Let there be no divisions:** His desire was not simply that they avoid divisiveness, but that they be so filled with the Spirit of Christ that they would **be of one mind, united in thought and purpose** (cp. *Phil 2:2*).\n\n
1:11	idm148901					 **Chloe** was a Corinthian woman, not mentioned elsewhere in Scripture.\n\n
1:12	idm148908					 The Christians in Corinth had formed factions loyal to different Christian leaders, but the leaders themselves do not seem to have been in conflict. **Paul***,* as the one who had first brought the Good News to Corinth, would receive the loyalty of some. • **Apollos***,* now with Paul (see *16:12*), was an eloquent Alexandrian Jew who had become a powerful Christian evangelist and had ministered in Corinth (see *Acts 18:24–19:1*). He attracted followers because of his skillful oratory (perhaps in contrast to Paul) and his ability to interpret Scripture. • **Peter:** Greek *Cephas*; see also *Matt 16:18*; *John 1:42* Peter was the primary early evangelist to the Jews. He represented a more traditional Jewish perspective and had a gift for speaking in front of crowds (see *Acts 1:15-22*; *2:14-40*; *3:12-26*; *4:8-12*; *10:34-43*). • **I follow only Christ:** This might refer to a group who disavowed allegiance to any human authority and viewed themselves as more holy than others.\n\n
1:13	idm148930					 Paul asks three rhetorical questions, all expecting the obvious answer, “no.” Christian devotion is to be given to Christ, not to his messengers.\n\n
1:14	idm148936					 **Crispus and Gaius** were two of Paul’s earliest converts in Corinth. Crispus was a former leader of the synagogue in Corinth (see *Acts 18:8*), and Gaius later offered Paul the use of his home (see *Rom 16:23*). This might identify him with Titius Justus, an earlier convert to Judaism who lived next door to the synagogue (see *Acts 18:7*). His full Roman name would then be Gaius Titius Justus.\n\n
1:16	idm148946					 **The household of Stephanas** were the first converts in the province of Achaia (southern Greece; see *16:15*). *Household* refers to all who lived in the house, which might include more than Stephanas’s immediate family.\n\n
1:17	idm148955					 The important thing is not baptism, but the preaching of **the Good News***;* baptism signifies people’s response to the message. • **clever speech:** Eloquence, or an appeal to human wisdom. • **for fear that the cross of Christ would lose its power:** Too much emphasis on eloquence and the persuasiveness of human reason can distract from the simple message that Christ died for people’s sins so that they could be forgiven (*1 Cor 2:1-5*; *15:1-3*).\n\n
1:18	idm148967					 Paul contrasts eloquence and human wisdom, which were highly valued by some of the Corinthians, with the foolish message of the cross—the expression of God’s wisdom. The followers of Apollos, in particular (see *1:12*), were probably attracted by his rhetorical abilities and intellectual approach to ministry (see *Acts 18:24-28*). In contrast, Paul emphasizes that the real power lies in the simple message of the cross of Christ.\n\n
1:18	idm148975					 The message that God is saving the world through a condemned criminal **is foolish** to unbelievers, for their eyes are blinded to the truth (*2 Cor 4:4*). For believers, whose eyes have been opened by God, **the message of the cross** has the ring of truth to it, and they know its **power** to convict the human heart (see *1 Cor 1:23-24*; *Rom 1:16*). Unbelievers, still in their sin, are **headed for destruction***,* for ultimate condemnation. Believers, whose sins have been forgiven, **are being saved:** They are on their way to eternal life and glory.\n\n
1:19	idm148990					 This quotation from *Isa 29:14* shows God’s estimation of mere human **wisdom**.\n\n
1:20	idm148998					 In God’s eyes, the human **wisdom of this world** is **foolish**. Divine wisdom lies in the message of the cross and in Jesus Christ (see *1:24*, *30*).\n\n
1:21	idm149008					 **Human wisdom** alone does not bring people to the true knowledge of God; that comes only through the message of the cross, which the world considers **foolish***,* but which saves **those who believe** (cp. *Matt 11:25*).\n\n
1:22	idm149019					 Paul uses the words **Greeks** and **Gentiles** interchangeably to refer to non-Jews.\n\n
1:22	idm149027					 Unbelieving **Jews** wanted to see miraculous **signs** to validate the message (cp. *Matt 12:38-39*; *16:1-4*; *John 2:18*, *23*; *4:48*). **Greeks***,* renowned for their schools of philosophy, were only interested in **human wisdom**—i.e., philosophical reasoning.\n\n
1:23	idm149043					 Regardless of what unbelieving **Jews** and **Gentiles** desired, Paul refused to give them anything but the simple message of the cross. To many Jews, the idea of a crucified Messiah was a contradiction in terms because crucifixion expressed not the power and blessing of God but his curse (see *Gal 3:13*; cp. *Deut 21:23*).\n\n
1:25	idm149053					 What the unbelieving world considers **foolish** and weak—Christ and the message of the cross—is in reality **wiser** and **stronger** than anything the world has to offer. It solves the world’s greatest problem, the problem of sin, and overcomes all the powers of evil that oppose human beings.\n\n
1:26	idm149062					 Socially and culturally, most Corinthian Christians were ordinary people; **few** were among the elite (cp. *Matt 11:25*). Only a few Christians, such as Erastus, the city treasurer in Corinth (see *Rom 16:23*), were **wealthy** (or *high born;* cp. *Jas 2:5*).\n\n
1:27	idm149074					 God chose **despised** and humble people in order to demonstrate his judgment on human pride (cp. *Rom 3:27*; *4:2*; *2 Cor 4:7-11*; *12:8-10*; *Eph 2:9*).\n\n
1:30	idm149086					 When people are **united** . . . **with Christ Jesus***,* God makes them righteous, **holy***,* and free (see *6:11*; *Rom 3:21-26*; *5:17-21*). This work of Christ is an expression of God’s **wisdom**.\n\n
1:31	idm149101					 This quotation is a paraphrase of *Jer 9:24* (cp. *2 Cor 10:17*). Because salvation is a result of God’s sovereign power (*1 Cor 2:5*) and his decision to save his people, there is absolutely no room for human pride (see *1:29*).\n\n
2:1	idm149111					 God’s sovereign work made Paul’s preaching effective. In his evangelism, Paul did not rely on the persuasive power of his intellect or his dynamic personality, but on the power of the Holy Spirit (see also *study note on 1:18-31*).\n\n
2:1	idm149118					 **When I first came to you:** See *Acts 18:1-17*. **lofty words and impressive wisdom:** Human wisdom and philosophy don’t bring people to Christ (see *1 Cor 1:17*, *21*; *2:2*). The message of the cross has its own power to convert the human heart (see *1:17*; *Rom 1:16*; *Gal 6:14*). • **God’s secret plan:** See *study note on 1 Cor 2:7*.\n\n
2:3	idm149135					 Human **weakness** is no barrier to God’s work (*2 Cor 12:7-10*). The real power is not in charismatic preaching, finesse of presentation, or logical persuasiveness (cp. *2 Cor 10:10*), but in the **message** itself, centered on Christ and his death for our sins, and in the power of **the Holy Spirit***,* who convicts the human heart.\n\n
2:6	idm149147					 Paul emphasizes God’s **wisdom** in contrast to the world’s wisdom. Real **wisdom** is not mere human wisdom but the wisdom of the Spirit, expressed in the so-called “foolishness” of the Good News (see *1:20-25*).\n\n
2:6	idm149156					 Only the spiritually **mature** will recognize God’s **wisdom***;* many of the Corinthians would have been unable to recognize it (see *3:1-3*). • **The rulers of this world** (see also *2:8*) . . . **are soon forgotten** because Christ now rules—his enemies have been defeated by his death on the cross (see *15:24-25*; *Col 2:15*).\n\n
2:7	idm149171					 In Paul’s writings, **mystery** often refers to a truth **previously hidden** but now revealed in the Good News of Christ and his saving work (see *Rom 11:25-27*; *1 Tim 3:9*, *16*). • **before the world began:** From the very beginning, it has been God’s desire to save his chosen people through Christ (see *Rom 16:25-26*; *Eph 1:9-12*; *3:3-12*; *Col 1:25-27*) and to bring them to **ultimate glory** in the coming age (see *Rom 5:2*; *8:18-21*, *29-30*; *1 Thes 2:12*).\n\n
2:8	idm149192					 **The rulers of this world** are probably political rulers rather than spiritual authorities (see also *15:24*; cp. *Acts 3:14-15*; *4:10*; *5:29-32*).\n\n
2:9	idm149203					 This quotation (cp. *Isa 64:4*) supports Paul’s point (*1 Cor 2:8*): Those with no spiritual sensitivity do not understand God’s work of redemption.\n\n
2:10	idm149211					 **it was to us:** Those who believe in Christ and have thus received his Spirit (see *6:19*; *12:13*; *Gal 3:2*; *Eph 1:13*; *Titus 3:5*) are contrasted with the rulers of this world (*1 Cor 2:8*). **God’s deep secrets** are not understood through secular wisdom or philosophy, but through **God’s own Spirit***,* who alone can reveal **God’s thoughts** to his people (see *1 Jn 2:20*, *27*; cp. *Matt 11:25-27*). God has graciously given his Spirit to his people so they **can know the wonderful things God has freely given** them (cp. *John 16:13-14*).\n\n
2:13	idm149233					 **using the Spirit’s words to explain spiritual truths:** Just as spiritual wisdom is different from **human wisdom***,* so the way spiritual wisdom is taught must be different from the way human wisdom is taught. The communicating and learning of spiritual truth must be done in the dimension and power of the Spirit; it is not simply a rational, human exercise.\n\n
2:14	idm149242					 **people who aren’t spiritual:** Unbelievers, whose minds are blinded to the Spirit, function in the natural world and see life only through physical eyes (see *2 Cor 4:4*). They cannot appreciate the significance of the Good News, for it is essentially a **spiritual** message.\n\n
2:15	idm149251					 **Those who are spiritual:** People who have the Spirit have a true understanding of divine revelation.\n\n
2:16	idm149258					 This quotation from *Isa 40:13* shows how divine wisdom transcends the limitations of human reasoning (cp. *Rom 11:34*). • **we have the mind of Christ:** Linked to Christ, believers have the Spirit of Christ to reveal Christ’s thinking to them.\n\n
3:1	idm149267					 Having contrasted human and spiritual wisdom, Paul now returns to the divisiveness in the Corinthian church (see *1:10-12*), particularly their misplaced devotion to himself and Apollos.\n\n
3:1	idm149274					 Paul rebukes the Christians in Corinth for their spiritual immaturity.\n\n
3:1	idm149280					 The Corinthians’ behavior was not that of the **spiritual people** whom Paul described in *2:15*, but like that of unbelievers who are attracted to the wisdom and values of **this world**. • **infants in Christ:** Though they were converted, their lives and thinking did not reflect maturity in Christ and the transforming perspective of his Spirit.\n\n
3:2	idm149290					 Because of the Corinthian Christians’ lack of spiritual maturity, Paul was unable to speak about the deeper truths of life in Christ, the **solid food** (see *2:6-7*) that is reserved for mature Christians. Instead, he had to restrict himself to **milk***,* the basic teachings of the Good News (cp. *Heb 5:12-14*; *6:1-3*; *1 Pet 2:2*).\n\n
3:3	idm149303					 Their jealousy and quarreling (see *1:10-12*) showed that they were **still** just like unbelievers, **controlled by** their **sinful nature** rather than by the Spirit of God (cp. *2 Cor 12:20*; *Gal 5:19-21*).\n\n
3:4	idm149315					 Proudly identifying oneself with a preferred teacher (see *1:12*) was common in Greek culture, but it is not in keeping with the mind of Christ (*3:5-9*; cp. *Matt 23:8-10*).\n\n
3:5	idm149324					 To identify oneself proudly as a follower of a human teacher is wrong because God does the real work of redemption, so he deserves the honor. • **We are only God’s servants:** Cp. *2 Cor 4:5*.\n\n
3:6	idm149332					 **I planted:** See *Acts 18:1-11*. • **Apollos watered:** See *Acts 18:27–19:1*.\n\n
3:10	idm149342					 All people are accountable to God for the way they serve Christ.\n\n
3:10	idm149348					 Paul **laid the foundation** when he first began the church in Corinth. **Now others** were **building on it** by what they were teaching the young Christians.\n\n
3:11	idm149357					 There can never be **any** other **foundation** for the church than **Jesus Christ** himself (see *Isa 28:16*; *1 Pet 2:4-8*; cp. *Rom 9:33*), but the Corinthians were in danger of treating a human teacher as their foundation.\n\n
3:12	idm149369					 Some of the things that people build on the **foundation** of Christ will endure; other things will burn up in the fire of judgment (cp. *Mal 4:1*). On **judgment day***,* the work of **each builder** who instructs the church will be assessed (cp. *Jas 3:1*; see also *Rom 14:10-12*; *2 Cor 5:10*). Those whose teachings are faithful and true **will receive a reward***;* the others **will suffer great loss***,* not of their salvation but of their reward. They themselves **will be saved***,* but just barely, like someone pulled to safety **through a wall of flames** (cp. *Amos 4:11*; *Zech 3:2*; *Jude 1:23*).\n\n
3:16	idm149393					 Christians must be very careful, both in what they teach and in how they relate to one another, because the body of believers is **the temple of God***,* the home of **the Spirit of God** who **lives in** them (cp. *Eph 2:21-22*), and **God’s temple is holy** (see *1 Cor 1:2*). There are terrible consequences for **anyone who destroys** God’s temple by such things as jealousy, argumentativeness, and divisiveness (see *3:3-4*).\n\n
3:18	idm149408					 Here Paul returns to the contrast between human wisdom and divine wisdom (see *1:18-25*). Using Old Testament quotations, Paul encourages the Corinthians to be willing to appear foolish in the eyes of the world so that they may be **truly wise** in God’s eyes.\n\n
3:21	idm149416					 As the privileged children of God, they may now lay claim to **everything**—**the world***,* and **life and death***,* and **the present and the future** (see *Rom 8:38-39*). So there is no point in claiming **a particular human leader** as their own.\n\n
3:23	idm149430					 Just as they may now claim everything as their own, so **Christ** has claimed them for himself (see *Rom 14:7-9*), and in Christ they are ultimately claimed by **God** (see *1 Cor 6:19-20*; *7:23*).\n\n
4:1	idm149441					 Paul emphasizes his faithfulness and the genuineness of his motives as an apostle of Christ. But only God can judge the heart.\n\n
4:1	idm149447					 Paul and Apollos should not be viewed as leaders competing for a following, but as **mere servants of Christ who have been put in charge of explaining God’s mysteries**. They were stewards entrusted with administration of the master’s business (as in *Luke 12:42*); their whole life was devoted to their master’s concerns, not to their own. • **God’s mysteries:** See *study note on 1 Cor 2:7*.\n\n
4:3	idm149457					 Paul’s deepest desire was that he be found faithful before God. Human assessments of him—by himself or others—didn’t matter.\n\n
4:5	idm149463					 **don’t make judgments about anyone:** Only the Lord can fully know a person’s heart, and when he returns, he will judge. Paul took God’s judgment of his ministry very seriously (see *2 Cor 5:9-10*; *Phil 2:16*; *1 Thes 2:19-20*; cp. *2 Cor 1:14*).\n\n
4:6	idm149474					 Paul again rebukes the Corinthian Christians for their arrogance (*4:6-13*) and then admonishes them as a father (*4:14-21*).\n\n
4:7	idm149482					 Pride in a particular leader results from failure to realize that **everything** is **a gift** from God. There is no room for pride; humble gratitude is the only appropriate attitude.\n\n
4:8	idm149490					 Paul ironically highlights the difference between himself and them. Their attitudes reflect the wisdom of the world; his, the wisdom of God. In their pride, the Corinthians thought they had arrived, but they actually had a long way to go (cp. *Rev 3:17-18*; contrast *Phil 3:12-14*). If they had truly arrived, they would be sharing more of the suffering that Paul experienced (*1 Cor 4:11-13*). In contrast to the Corinthians, who were so proud of their attainments and the respect they had from others, the apostles suffered scorn and contempt.\n\n
4:9	idm149499					 Like **prisoners** . . . **condemned to die** by facing wild animals in the amphitheater, the apostles were **a spectacle**. Paul gladly accepted suffering because God was using it to bring blessing to others (see *2 Cor 1:4-7*; *4:7-12*; *Phil 2:17*; *Col 1:24*).\n\n
4:11	idm149512					 Paul reminds the Corinthians how much he had endured for Christ’s sake (cp. *2 Cor 6:4-5*; *11:23-28*).\n\n
4:12	idm149520					 **We work:** To avoid being blamed by others for taking money, Paul preferred to support himself (*9:3-18*; *Acts 18:3*; *20:33-35*). • **We bless those who curse us:** Paul’s response was in line with Jesus’ teaching (*Matt 5:44-45*; cp. *Rom 12:14*, *17-21*).\n\n
4:14	idm149534					 Paul concludes this section on divisions in the church (*1:10–4:21*) with gentle words of fatherly admonition and warning.\n\n
4:14	idm149541					 As their **spiritual father** who first brought them the Good News, Paul affirms his genuine concern for their well-being (cp. *1 Thes 2:11-12*). As his **beloved children***,* they should listen to their father and **imitate** his example and teachings (see *1 Cor 11:1*; *Gal 4:12*; *Phil 3:17*; *4:9*; *1 Thes 1:6*; *2 Thes 3:7-9*).\n\n
4:17	idm149558					 **Timothy***,* Paul’s **child** in the faith and one of his closest associates, was with Paul when he first preached the Good News in Corinth (see *2 Cor 1:19*). Paul sent him to faithfully communicate what it means to **follow Christ Jesus**.\n\n
4:18	idm149569					 Because of his sending Timothy, some may have concluded that Paul lacked the courage to **visit** them himself, but in fact Paul was deeply engrossed in his work in Ephesus at this time (*Acts 19:8-20*; see *study note on Acts 19:10*). He would indeed visit them soon (see *1 Cor 16:5-9*; *Acts 19:21-22*; *20:1-3*; cp. *2 Cor 1:15–2:4*) and would confront those who publicly opposed him and show that they were nothing more than big talkers. His life and words would demonstrate the reality of **God’s power** (see also *1 Cor 2:4*).\n\n
5:1	idm149584					 Paul confronts **sexual immorality** in the church and instructs the Christians to expel a shameless offender from their fellowship.\n\n
5:1	idm149591					 **sexual immorality:** A man was having sex with **his stepmother**. Such behavior **even pagans** didn’t do: It violated both the law of Moses (see *Lev 18:7-8*) and Roman law (Gaius, *Institutes* 1.63).\n\n
5:2	idm149602					 The Corinthian Christians were **proud** (see *4:8*, *10*, *18*; *5:6*), when they should have been **mourning in sorrow and shame** over such sin among them. • **remove this man from your fellowship:** This instruction might presuppose that the man had refused their appeals, or that such blatant sin required immediate discipline (cp. *Matt 18:15-18*).\n\n
5:3	idm149616					 **in the Spirit:** Paul’s spiritual unity with them and the authority he had received from God through the Spirit were effective among them.\n\n
5:5	idm149623					 The instruction to **throw this man out** is not in the Greek text but is implied from *5:2*, *13*. • **and hand him over to Satan:** Cp. *1 Tim 1:20*. Those who are outside of God’s church are under the power and control of Satan (see *Eph 2:2*; *1 Jn 5:19*). • **so that his sinful nature will be destroyed:** (literally *for the destruction of the flesh*): *The flesh* may be interpreted figuratively as a reference to his evil desires or literally as his physical life (i.e., *so that he will die*). • **and he himself will be saved:** Perhaps he would repent and not be condemned (cp. *2 Cor 2:5-8*). • **on the day the Lord returns:** Literally *in the day of the Lord*, which includes the final judgment.\n\n
5:6	idm149644					 **Yeast** was often a symbol of **sin** (cp. *Matt 16:6*, *12*; *Mark 8:15*; *Luke 12:1*; *Gal 5:9*). Jews ceremonially cleansed their homes of yeast before the annual Passover meal (*Exod 12:19*; *13:7*). • **Get rid of . . . this wicked person:** Sin, if unaddressed, could spread throughout the church, just as **yeast** spreads throughout a **batch of dough**.\n\n
5:7	idm149662					 Paul draws an analogy between the traditional Jewish **Passover** celebration and the sacrifice of **Christ**. In the Passover celebration, a **lamb** was sacrificed and unleavened bread was eaten (see *Exod 12:1-27*; *13:3-7*). The sacrifice of Christ, which occurred at Passover (*Matt 26:2*; cp. *John 1:29*; *1 Pet 1:19*), results in the removal of sin for believers.\n\n
5:9	idm149676					 The church is to discipline anyone in the church who is known to be living in sin.\n\n
5:9	idm149682					 **When I wrote to you before** refers to an earlier letter now lost. • **Sexual sin** is any form of illicit sexual activity (see also *6:9*).\n\n
5:10	idm149691					 Paul generally encouraged believers not to separate themselves from the company of sinful unbelievers (e.g., *10:27*).\n\n
5:11	idm149698					 Separation from a professing **believer** who was living in sin was intended to reinforce and maintain the high moral standards of the Christian community. The social pressure it exerted might also encourage repentance in an erring brother or sister (cp. *2 Thes 3:6*, *14*).\n\n
5:12	idm149707					 Christians are not called to **judge** (i.e., discipline) sin in unbelievers, but in believers.\n\n
6:1	idm149714					 When serious differences arise between two Christians, they are not to be settled by **a secular court***,* but by **other believers**.\n\n
6:2	idm149723					 **Someday we believers will judge the world**—and even **angels**—as associates of the Son of Man, who is the ultimate Judge of all people (cp. *Dan 7:13*, *22*, *27*; *Matt 19:28*; *John 5:27*; *Acts 17:31*; *Rev 3:21*; *20:4*). In light of this responsibility, Christians should be able to settle their disagreements over comparatively **little things**.\n\n
6:4	idm149740					 **I am saying this to shame you:** It is a scandal for Christians to have to resolve their conflicts in secular courts, as if there were no one in the church sufficiently capable of resolving them.\n\n
6:7	idm149747					 **Even to have such lawsuits with one another is a defeat for you:** To sue a fellow believer reflects self-interest rather than concern for the welfare of others or the glory of God. • **Why not just accept the injustice?** Christians are called to follow the example of Christ’s self-sacrifice (see *Matt 5:38-42*).\n\n
6:8	idm149756					 Far from following Christ’s example or his teachings about sacrificial love, some of the Corinthian believers were cheating **even** their **fellow believers**. Both their actions and their attitudes were wrong.\n\n
6:9	idm149764					 Those who willingly sin have no share in the Kingdom of God. The lives of Christians must reflect the faith they confess.\n\n
6:9	idm149770					 **Don’t fool yourselves:** Sin is deceptive; believers should not take it lightly, as if it were somehow acceptable (*Jer 17:9*). • Continuing to **indulge** unrepentantly **in sexual sin** indicates a heart that has not been renewed by the Holy Spirit. Sexual sins include **adultery** (see *Exod 20:14*; *Matt 5:27-28*) and practicing **homosexuality** (cp. *Lev 18:22*; *20:13*; *Rom 1:26-27*; *1 Tim 1:10*).\n\n
6:10	idm149788					 **none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God:** The repetition of this point (also *6:9*) emphasizes the severe consequences of living in sin (for similar warnings, see *Gal 5:19-21*; *Eph 5:5*; cp. *Col 3:5-6*).\n\n
6:11	idm149799					 Following the strong warning of *6:9-10*, Paul reaffirms his confidence in the genuineness of his readers’ conversion. • **you were cleansed** (cp. *Acts 22:16*): Cleanliness is a metaphor for the righteousness that comes from forgiveness (see *Titus 3:5*). They **were made holy** by God himself (see *1 Cor 1:2*). • They **were made right with God** by their identification with **the Lord Jesus Christ** and by the transforming work of **the Spirit of our God**. God has forgiven them and views them as righteous (see *Rom 1:17*; *3:21-26*), and their lives have really been changed for the good (see *Titus 3:5-7*).\n\n
6:12	idm149817					 Paul gives several reasons why Christians must not engage in sexual immorality.\n\n
6:12	idm149823					 **“I am allowed to do anything”** seems to have been a popular attitude among some Christians who were sexually immoral. Paul counters this attitude by emphasizing that not all things are helpful; true Christians must lead disciplined lives (cp. *10:23*; *Gal 5:13*).\n\n
6:13	idm149832					 **“Food was made for the stomach, and the stomach for food”:** This statement was apparently used by some Corinthian Christians to rationalize their sexual immorality on the analogy that “the body was made for sex, and sex for the body.” It is a false analogy, because **our bodies** . . . **were made for the Lord***,* and **sexual immorality** does not glorify him. In light of his concern for our bodies and the coming resurrection** from the dead***,* our bodies must be used for holy purposes in God’s service.\n\n
6:15	idm149845					 To be a Christian is to be spiritually joined to Christ in both life and death (cp. *Rom 6:3-11*). As a result, believers’ **bodies** have become **parts of Christ** (cp. *1 Cor 12:12-28*; *Rom 12:4-5*). This spiritual union (cp. *John 14:20*; *17:21-23*) means that they are not free to violate their bodies by physical union with a **prostitute**.\n\n
6:18	idm149859					 For Christians, the body is **the temple of the Holy Spirit** (see *study note on 3:16-17*; cp. *2 Cor 6:16*). Sexual sin violates this sacred sanctuary and the divine presence. • **You do not belong to yourself:** Christians can no longer claim their bodies as their own, as they have been **bought** . . . **with a high price***,* the blood of Christ (cp. *1 Cor 7:23*; *Rev 5:9*), and every part of their lives has been claimed by Christ for God’s glory (see *Rom 14:7-9*; *2 Cor 5:14-15*).\n\n
7:1	idm149876					 Paul now addresses **the questions** the Corinthians had **asked** him by **letter***,* beginning with the question of marriage (cp. *7:25*; *8:1*; *12:1*; *16:1*).\n\n
7:1	idm149890					 Paul consistently states his strong conviction that true Christians, as slaves of Christ, are wholly claimed by Christ the Lord for his own service. Because of this, he recommends that Christians remain single, but concedes that getting married is no sin.\n\n
7:1	idm149896					 **it is good to abstain from sexual relations:** Both Paul and Jesus encouraged the ideal of a celibate life for God’s sake (cp. *Matt 19:10-12*). Paul’s emphasis on celibacy is shaped by his expectation that the end of the age is near (see *1 Cor 7:29-31*).\n\n
7:2	idm149905					 Because of widespread **sexual immorality***,* Paul encourages most Christians to get married (*7:9*). He tempers the ideal of the celibate life with awareness of physical realities.\n\n
7:3	idm149914					 Because of the temptation to sexual immorality, married Christians must always be considerate of the **sexual needs** of their spouses. Sexual intimacy is a mutual right for both spouses in a marriage and must not be withheld. Marriage includes yielding the **authority** over one’s body to one’s spouse, though such authority is clearly not to be abused.\n\n
7:6	idm149922					 Paul’s preference is singleness, but he recognizes that both marriage and the single life are among the gifts that God gives to various people.\n\n
7:8	idm149928					 Paul’s general advice is that **it’s better to stay unmarried** because of the opportunities it provides to serve Christ without distraction (*7:32-35*). But even with its distractions, an honorable marriage is much better than living a life dominated by unsatisfied sexual desire.\n\n
7:10	idm149936					 Paul advises Christian couples contemplating divorce. • **a command that comes . . . from the Lord:** This doesn’t mean that Paul’s other instructions (see *7:12*, *25*, *40*) have less authority. It means this particular counsel is grounded in known sayings of Jesus (see *Matt 5:32*; *19:9*; *Mark 10:11-12*; *Luke 16:18*). • **But if she does leave him:** Paul acknowledges that some couples have great difficulty in living together, but even in that case they must honor their marriage vows to be faithful to their spouse alone (see *1 Cor 7:27*; *Rom 7:2*).\n\n
7:12	idm149953					 Paul now turns to the case of a Christian married to an unbeliever. • **I do not have a direct command from the Lord:** Paul knew of no saying of Jesus that was directly applicable, but his counsel is consistent: Believers must be faithful and honor their marriage commitment.\n\n
7:14	idm149960					 By remaining committed to the marriage, the Christian **brings holiness** to the unbelieving spouse. Such holiness extends to the **children***,* who also benefit from the holiness of a Christian parent (cp. *Mal 2:15*).\n\n
7:15	idm149970					 If the unbeliever breaks up the marriage, **the believing husband or wife** is free to **let them go**. • **has called you:** God’s desire is that his people **live in peace***,* rather than in the intolerable conflict of a mixed marriage no longer desired by the non-Christian spouse.\n\n
7:16	idm149981					 There is always the hope that the believing spouse will win the unbelieving mate to faith in Christ. However, the Greek text is ambiguous and could also be interpreted as saying that there is no guarantee that the believing mate will ever win over the unbelieving spouse.\n\n
7:17	idm149987					 Paul states as a general principle that Christians should accept their God-given lot in life.\n\n
7:17	idm149993					 As a general rule, Christians should continue in the social **situation** in which they first became believers (see *7:20*, *24*).\n\n
7:18	idm150002					 Circumcision illustrates the general principle just stated (*7:17*). All Jewish males were circumcised. Some, seeking acceptance in Gentile society, attempted to reverse the procedure surgically (see *1 Maccabees* 1:14-15; Josephus, *Antiquities* 12.5.1), a practice Paul discourages. Circumcision has little importance (see also *Rom 2:28-29*; *4:9-12*; *Gal 5:2-6*; *6:12-15*; *Phil 3:2-3*) compared with keeping **God’s commandments,** such as the commands to love God and others.\n\n
7:21	idm150017					 Slavery illustrates the general principle stated in *7:17*, *20*, *24*. Slavery was widespread in the Greco-Roman world, and many Christian converts were slaves serving rich families. Like circumcision, one’s own slavery is, according to Paul, a relatively unimportant issue for the Christian. Even as a slave, the Christian is spiritually **free** from the power of sin, death, and the law (see *Rom 6:14*; *7:4-6*; *8:2*). And as a freeman, the believer is still **a slave of Christ** (see *Eph 6:5-6*; *1 Pet 2:16*). • As one who has been purchased at a **high price** (see *1 Cor 6:20*), the free Christian ought not to **be enslaved by the world**.\n\n
7:25	idm150036					 Paul gives three reasons why it is generally preferable for single people to remain **unmarried**. First, single people have fewer everyday **problems** than married people. Second, because the end is near, Christians ought not let marriage and the things of the world be their dominant concerns. Their primary concern should be Christ and eternity. Third, because marriage brings **earthly responsibilities** and **divided** interests, those who choose to remain single can devote their lives more fully to serving Christ.\n\n
7:36	idm150046					 Paul recommends celibate life in preference to marriage, but he allows for marriage if a person’s sexual desires prove too much of a temptation. Those in firm **control** of their sexual desires are encouraged to choose the celibate life.\n\n
7:39	idm150053					 A widow may marry another man, but **only if he loves the Lord**. Paul strongly discouraged the marriage of Christians to unbelievers (cp. *2 Cor 6:14-16*).\n\n
8:1	idm150061					 Paul now addresses the Corinthians’ **question about food that has been offered to idols:** Throughout the Greco-Roman world, there were temples and shrines dedicated to pagan gods. It was common for worshipers of those gods to offer animal sacrifices, and the excess meat was then sold in the market by pagan priests. The question inevitably arose as to whether Christians were free to eat such meat. Is meat taken from an animal that has been sacrificed to a pagan god inherently defiled? Paul makes no mention here of the prohibition made by the Jewish Christian leaders in *Acts 15:20*, *29* but emphasizes that one’s actions must be governed, above all, by loving consideration of others. After introducing the topic (*1 Cor 8:1-13*), he provides several illustrations of the principle of giving up one’s rights for the sake of others (*9:1-27*) and then gives his advice on three specific situations in which believers faced this issue.\n\n
8:1	idm150072					 **“We all have knowledge”** was apparently a common saying of the Corinthian Christians. The *knowledge* in question is religious knowledge, paraded by certain Christians who might have felt their superior understanding made them unaccountable to the opinions of others.\n\n
8:2	idm150080					 It is those who truly love God—not just those who **know all the answers**—who are acknowledged by God as his own (see *13:12*; *Gal 4:9*).\n\n
8:4	idm150089					 In reality, the **idols** to which such meat is sacrificed are not gods, for **there is only one God** (*Deut 6:4*; cp. *Deut 4:35*, *39*; *10:19-20*). He is the Creator of everything, including the meat in question. The only ultimate reality is **God, the Father,** and the **one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things were created** (cp. *John 1:3*; *Col 1:16*; *Heb 1:2*).\n\n
8:7	idm150106					 Many of the Corinthian believers, having grown up in the pagan world, viewed eating such meat as an expression of devotion to the god to whom the meat had been sacrificed. For such Christians, to eat meat presented to an idol would violate their **weak consciences** (see *8:10-12*; *10:28-29*; *Rom 14:13-23*).\n\n
8:8	idm150116					 The Corinthians’ relationship with the living God was not affected by eating or not eating, whatever the source of the food (cp. *Rom 14:17*).\n\n
8:9	idm150123					 Believers must **be careful** that what they do (such as eating sacrificial meat) **does not cause others . . . to stumble** (cp. *Rom 14:13*, *20-21*; *Gal 5:13*).\n\n
8:11	idm150134					 For believers to insist on eating food offered to idols—because their **superior knowledge** assured them that they are free to eat such food—could destroy less mature Christians (who understood eating this meat as an expression of worship of pagan gods). • **for whom Christ died:** Cp. *Rom 14:15*.\n\n
8:12	idm150143					 To make immature **believers** sin by violating their conscience is the same as **sinning against Christ***,* who has claimed them for himself (cp. *Matt 25:40*, *45*).\n\n
8:13	idm150154					 Personal rights must be subordinated to the larger commitment not **to cause another believer to stumble**.\n\n
9:1	idm150161					 Continuing the argument begun in *8:1* (see *study note on 8:1–11:1*), Paul cites personal examples of his giving up his own rights for the sake of other people.\n\n
9:1	idm150169					 These four rhetorical questions each expect a positive answer. The first, following his discussion in *8:1-13*, is an assertion of Paul’s freedom from Jewish ritual obligations—though, as he later emphasizes (see *9:19-23*), he freely accommodates himself to the practices of Jews in his desire to win them to Christ. The other three rhetorical questions are assertions of Paul’s apostolic authority, which was apparently being questioned by some in Corinth. • For those who might be skeptical, the reality of Paul’s apostolic calling was verified by his firsthand encounter with **Jesus our Lord** on the road to Damascus (see *15:8*; *Acts 9:3-6*, *17*). Also, the Corinthians themselves, who came to faith through Paul’s evangelism (see *Acts 18:1-11*), were **proof** (literally *the seal*) of his status as an **apostle**.\n\n
9:3	idm150185					 **my answer** (literally *my defense*): This is a legal term for the argument made in response to accusations. • **those who question my authority:** See *2 Cor 11–12* for another response to their challenge.\n\n
9:4	idm150195					 As an apostle, Paul had **the right** to expect food and housing from those to whom he ministered (cp. *9:14*; *Luke 10:7-8*). Nevertheless, to avoid any possible criticism, he did not take advantage of this privilege (see *9:6*, *12*, *14-15*, *18*; *2 Cor 11:7-9*; *12:13-14*).\n\n
9:5	idm150210					 **the Lord’s brothers:** See *Mark 6:3* for their names. • **Peter:** *Mark 1:30* also speaks of Peter as married.\n\n
9:7	idm150220					 These examples support Paul’s point that he and other Christian workers had a right to be supported by those they served.\n\n
9:12	idm150226					 Compared with other Christian workers supported by the Corinthians, Paul claimed **an even greater right to be supported** by them, because he was the one who first brought the Good News to them. But to avoid criticism, he had **never used this right** (see *9:6*, *14-15*, *18*; cp. *Acts 18:3*; *2 Cor 11:7-9*; *12:13-14*).\n\n
9:13	idm150240					 Paul might be referring to Levites and priests at God’s **temple** in Jerusalem (see *Deut 18:1-4*; cp. *Lev 6:16-17*, *26*; *Num 18:8-32*), but the pagan priests in temples around Corinth would have done similarly.\n\n
9:14	idm150251					 **the Lord ordered:** See *Matt 10:10*; *Luke 10:7*; see also *Gal 6:6*; *1 Tim 5:17-18*.\n\n
9:15	idm150262					 Paul had never pressed his **rights***,* nor was he now seeking to do so. Rather, he was illustrating the importance of giving up one’s rights for the sake of others (cp. *8:13*).\n\n
9:16	idm150271					 **compelled by God to do it:** *Acts 22:14-15*; *26:16-18*.\n\n
9:18	idm150280					 Paul’s satisfaction came from preaching the Good News **without charging anyone**. This is another example of the way Christians must be willing to give up their rights out of consideration for others (cp. *8:13*).\n\n
9:19	idm150288					 Paul places himself in the position of a **slave** in the household. He shows how far he was willing to go in adjusting his lifestyle and behavior to that of the people to whom he was preaching in order to win them **to Christ**.\n\n
9:24	idm150296					 To illustrate how seriously the Corinthians must take the discipline of their salvation, Paul alludes to the familiar Isthmian games, an athletic competition held every two years in Corinth. • **All athletes are disciplined:** Strict self-discipline is required for athletes competing for a prize. In Paul’s day, athletes endured months of rigorous training before competing. In the same way, strict self-discipline (cp. *Gal 5:22-23*) is required if a person is to gain the **eternal prize** of salvation. Christians must submit to the daily discipline of obeying Christ. • **a prize that will fade away:** Athletic prizes were often wreaths made out of laurel leaves (cp. *2 Tim 4:8*; *Jas 1:12*; *1 Pet 5:4*; *Rev 2:10*).\n\n
9:26	idm150310					 **I am not just shadowboxing:** Christians must engage in the real contest of obedience to Christ rather than merely going through the motions.\n\n
9:27	idm150317					 **I fear that . . . I myself might be disqualified:** Those who are disqualified from a sporting event have no hope of winning the prize. To avoid losing the eternal prize, Paul disciplined himself severely, like an athlete, so that he would not be led away from Christ into a life of sin (see *9:25*; *Heb 12:1*).\n\n
10:1	idm150326					 After illustrating from his own life the key principle of giving up one’s rights for the sake of others (ch *9*), Paul turns back to the specific question of eating meat sacrificed to idols (*8:1-13*). He warns believers of God’s wrath on those who sin, especially on those who engage in idolatry.\n\n
10:1	idm150334					 Even though the Israelites were God’s people and experienced his salvation and provision (see *Exod 13:21-22*; *14:21-29*), they still came under his judgment because of their disobedience.\n\n
10:2	idm150342					 **all of them were baptized:** Paul draws a parallel with the baptized Corinthians.\n\n
10:3	idm150349					 **Spiritual food . . . spiritual water:** God graciously and supernaturally provided food and water in the wilderness, especially for the people of Israel (see *Exod 16:4-35*; *17:1-7*; *Num 20:2-17*). The Corinthians’ situation was analogous. • **The spiritual rock that traveled with them** alludes to the rock that Moses struck to get water (*Exod 17:1-7*; *Num 20:2-17*). Early Jewish tradition understood both occurrences of the miracle to involve the same rock that was traveling with them. • **that rock was Christ:** Paul’s interpretation of Israel’s experience provides a parallel between God’s provision in the wilderness and the Lord’s Supper (*1 Cor 10:14-18*; cp. *John 4:14*; *7:37-39*; *Rev 22:17*). Both the Israelites and Christians share in the spiritual provisions of Christ; and just as the Israelites were therefore judged for their sins, so Christians will be judged if they sin (*1 Cor 10:5-22*).\n\n
10:6	idm150368					 **evil things:** see *Num 11:4-6*, *34*.\n\n
10:7	idm150377					 **Feasting and drinking** refers to celebrations in honor of pagan gods; **pagan revelry** suggests wild partying with drinking and sex.\n\n
10:8	idm150385					 See *Num 25:1-9*.\n\n
10:9	idm150392					 **Nor . . . put Christ to the test:** See *Deut 6:16*; *Ps 78:18-20*; *Matt 4:7*. • **Christ:** Some manuscripts read *the Lord,* which probably represents a scribe’s attempt to harmonize with the Old Testament context.\n\n
10:10	idm150404					 See *Num 16:13-14*, *41-49*.\n\n
10:12	idm150412					 Paul gives the Corinthians a final warning against falling into sin (cp. *Rom 11:20-22*) and reminds them that **God is faithful** (see *1 Cor 1:9*; cp. *Deut 7:9*; *1 Pet 4:19*). God will not allow them to be **tempted** (or *tested;* cp. *Jas 1:2-4*) beyond their ability to endure, but will always provide **a way out**.\n\n
10:14	idm150427					 Paul warns his readers against anything that might be interpreted as idolatry (cp. *1 Jn 5:21*), which includes eating **food** in honor of a pagan god.\n\n
10:16	idm150435					 Paul affirms the spiritual meaning of sacred meals. In the Lord’s Supper, believers share in **the blood** and **body of Christ** (see also *11:17-34*; *Matt 26:26-28*; *Mark 14:22-24*; *Luke 22:19-20*). Sharing **one loaf** unites believers as **one body** in Christ, just as the pagans’ religious meals unite them with the gods they worship (see *1 Cor 10:19-21*).\n\n
10:19	idm150450					 **Idols** have no reality or life (see *8:4-6*), and **sacrifices** made to them accomplish nothing. The sacrifices pagans make to idols are actually unknowingly made to **demons** (see *Deut 32:16-17*; *Ps 106:37*; *Rev 9:20*). Those who share in their religious meals are thereby uniting themselves with **demons**.\n\n
10:21	idm150464					 Believers should avoid participating in religious meals eaten in a pagan temple (see *8:10*), because those united to **the Lord** (Christ) cannot simultaneously be united to **demons** (see *2 Cor 6:14-16*).\n\n
10:22	idm150474					 To ignore Paul’s advice on this matter is to rouse **the Lord’s jealousy** and judgment, just as Israel did (see *10:6-11*; *Exod 20:5*; *Deut 32:21*).\n\n
10:23	idm150484					 Paul closes the discussion begun in *8:1* with advice about when Christians may eat meat sacrificed to an idol, and when they should not (see *study note on 8:1–11:1*). His advice reflects the principle of giving up one’s rights out of love (see also *8:13–9:23*).\n\n
10:23	idm150493					 **You say:** The NLT supplies these words—Paul is probably quoting a popular saying among the Corinthians and clarifying it. • **“I am allowed to do anything”:** Paul qualifies the assertion of a Christian’s freedom by emphasizing the importance of doing what is most beneficial for **others** (see *6:12*; *10:32-33*; *Rom 14:13-15*, *19-21*; *15:1-2*; cp. *Phil 2:3-4*).\n\n
10:27	idm150508					 When Christians are invited for a meal with an unbeliever, the Christians are free to eat what is set before them unless warned that the meat has been **offered to an idol**. In that case, the Christian should refrain from eating it **out of consideration for the conscience** of the other person, who might misinterpret it or be hurt by believing that such eating honors the god to whom the meat has been sacrificed (see *8:7*, *9-10*; cp. *Rom 14:13-15*, *20-23*).\n\n
10:29	idm150520					 These two questions are difficult to understand in light of *10:28-29a*. By placing *10:28-29a* in parentheses, the NLT has interpreted these questions as expressing Paul’s own convictions, following on from *10:27*.\n\n
10:31	idm150529					 Paul concludes his discussion by summarizing the two principles that are to guide Christian behavior in issues like this: (1) Believers are to do everything **for the glory of God** (see *Col 3:17*; *1 Pet 4:11*); (2) believers are not to **give offense** and should avoid doing anything that would harm another person’s Christian faith (cp. *1 Cor 8:9*, *13*; *1 Jn 2:10*). Christians’ behavior is to be guided by what is best for others rather than by personal privilege (cp. *Rom 14:13-15*, *19-21*; *15:1-2*). These two basic principles lie at the heart of Paul’s advice on practical Christian living in this letter.\n\n
11:1	idm150545					 **imitate me:** Cp. *4:16*; *Phil 3:17*.\n\n
11:2	idm150554					 **the teachings I passed on to you:** This language generally refers to an authoritative tradition of Christian teaching being passed down orally (see also *11:23*; *15:1-3*; *2 Thes 2:15*).\n\n
11:3	idm150564					 Paul now addresses a woman’s use of a head covering. Paul argues that women publicly praying or prophesying should wear a veil as an element of dressing modestly and appropriately in public worship (cp. *1 Tim 2:9*; *1 Pet 3:3*). Apparently some in Corinth were rejecting head coverings based on freedom in Christ. Paul’s argument in favor of the custom is based on traditional social conventions, the Genesis account of creation, and the watchful eye of **angels**.\n\n
11:3	idm150573					 **The head of every man is Christ, the head of woman is man, and the head of Christ is God:** The NLT gives the literal reading *head,* which is a metaphor for either *source* or *authority*. The immediate context and Paul’s overall teaching both favor understanding *head* in this context as meaning *authority* (see *Gen 3:16*; *Eph 5:21-23*; *Col 3:18*; *1 Pet 3:1*).\n\n
11:4	idm150589					 In this passage, **head** is used in both a literal and a figurative sense. **A man** who **covers his** (physical) **head** when he prays **dishonors his** (spiritual) **head***,* Christ. **A woman** who **prays or prophesies without a covering on her** (physical) **head** thereby **dishonors her** (spiritual) **head***,* her husband. • The spiritual gift of **prophesying** is the God-given ability to speak a specific word from God, not merely to predict the future (cp. *12:10*; *14:1-5*; *1 Thes 5:20*). • **if she prays or prophesies:** Women were allowed to engage in public praying and prophesying in the church (cp. *Acts 21:9*).\n\n
11:7	idm150614					 **man is made in God’s image:** See *Gen 1:26-27*.\n\n
11:10	idm150622					 **because the angels are watching:** Angels are guardians of the created order, appointed to ensure that everything is done according to God’s plan (see *Gen 19:1-21*; *22:11-12*; *Exod 23:20*; *Num 22:22-23*; *Pss 34:7*; *91:11*; *103:20-21*; *Heb 1:7*, *14*). Believers are to do what is appropriate in the sight of fellow humans and God’s observing angels (cp. *1 Tim 5:21*). • **should wear a covering on her head to show she is under authority:** Or *should have authority over her own head.*\n\n
11:11	idm150641					 These verses qualify the preceding verses. Believers recognize that God has made men and women mutually dependent on one another. • **Everything comes from God** (cp. *8:6*): Both men and women must ultimately submit to God, the head of all.\n\n
11:13	idm150649					 **Is it right?** This rhetorical question expects the answer “no.”\n\n
11:14	idm150656					 **Isn’t it obvious?** (literally *Doesn’t nature itself teach you?*): In Paul’s culture, men would never wear long hair.\n\n
11:15	idm150664					 Paul argues that social conventions regarding hair length express fundamental differences between men and women. • **it has been given to her as a covering:** Paul suggests that women’s long hair, covering their head, shows that God intends women to have some type of “covering.”\n\n
11:16	idm150671					 **if anyone wants to argue about this:** Some in the cosmopolitan Corinthian church did not agree with Paul. • Paul’s final argument is that the use of a head covering was an established custom of the church. Most contemporary interpreters take this verse to mean that the custom was culturally based.\n\n
11:17	idm150678					 Paul addresses problems in the way the Corinthians were relating to each other and to the Lord while taking the Lord’s Supper.\n\n
11:17	idm150684					 **when you meet together:** Early Christians met together in someone’s home at least once a week, usually on the Lord’s Day (see *16:2*).\n\n
11:18	idm150692					 The **divisions** may be those spoken of in *1:10-12* (cp. *Titus 3:10*), or (more likely) the result of social discrimination when they shared meals (see *1 Cor 11:21-22*, *33*; *Acts 6:1*).\n\n
11:19	idm150704					 As translated, this ironic expression rebukes the Corinthian Christians’ claims to superiority based on distinctions among them. Alternatively, Paul might be saying that though their divisiveness is clearly wrong, it will have the positive result of making clear who among them is truly faithful.\n\n
11:20	idm150710					 Some people were more concerned about eating their own supper than with **the Lord’s Supper**.\n\n
11:23	idm150717					 **I pass on to you what I received from the Lord himself:** This is one of the few explicit references in Paul’s letters to traditions handed down from Christ (see also *7:10*; *9:14*; cp. *1 Thes 4:15-17*). • **On the night when he was betrayed:** See *Mark 14:43-46*.\n\n
11:24	idm150729					 Jews and early Christians traditionally **gave thanks** to God for their food before eating (see *study note on Mark 14:22-25*). • **This is my body:** Cp. *John 6:32-35*, *48-58*.\n\n
11:25	idm150740					 **After supper** might suggest that the main meal separated the breaking of the bread from the drinking of the cup (see *Luke 22:20*). • **The new covenant** is God’s promise to forgive sins because of the sacrificial death of Jesus (cp. *Jer 31:31-34*; *32:40*; *Luke 22:20*; *Heb 7:22*; *8:8-10*; *9:15*; *10:12-18*; *12:24*; *13:20*). The blood of a sacrifice **confirmed** an **agreement** or covenant (see *Exod 24:8*; *Zech 9:11*; *Heb 9:12*; *13:20*; cp. *Rom 3:25*; *5:9*).\n\n
11:26	idm150766					 In taking the Lord’s Supper, Christians proclaim the saving significance of **the Lord’s death** to those around them **until he comes again** (see *1:7-8*; cp. *1 Thes 1:9-10*; *3:12*; *4:13-18*; *5:23*).\n\n
11:27	idm150779					 To take the Lord’s Supper without recognizing its significance or with unconfessed sin in one’s life is to take it **unworthily** (see *11:28-31*). It is equivalent to **sinning against the body and blood** of the Lord himself; it treats his sacrificial death as trivial (cp. *Heb 10:29*).\n\n
11:28	idm150789					 Before taking the Lord’s Supper, Christians should confess their sins and consider what **the bread** and **the cup** signify (*11:26*).\n\n
11:29	idm150798					 In light of *11:27*, **the body of Christ** is probably to be understood here as a reference to the death of Christ, not to the church, though some interpret it that way. • Those who **eat the bread or drink the cup** unworthily thereby invoke **God’s judgment** upon themselves. Such judgment may be expressed in infirmities, sickness, and even death (cp. *Acts 5:5*, *10*).\n\n
11:31	idm150810					 Self-judgment (which implies confession of sin and repentance) averts God’s judgment.\n\n
11:32	idm150816					 When God’s people are **judged by the Lord** and **disciplined** (cp. *Deut 8:5*; *Heb 12:5-11*), it is for their ultimate good, so that they **will not be condemned along with the world** (see *Eph 2:1-3*).\n\n
11:34	idm150828					 **after I arrive:** Paul was planning to visit soon (*4:19*; *16:5-7*).\n\n
12:1	idm150837					 The church at Corinth had placed too much emphasis on the gift of tongues (see *14:1-25*, *27*; cp. the lists in *12:8-10*, *28*, where Paul places tongues last), so Paul gives corrective advice regarding the value and use of spiritual gifts.\n\n
12:1	idm150847					 Paul introduces the topic, emphasizing the active presence of the **Holy Spirit** in believers.\n\n
12:2	idm150854					 **pagans:** Gentile unbelievers.\n\n
12:3	idm150861					 Paul gives two criteria for discerning the presence of the Spirit in worship. (1) Those who **curse Jesus** thereby express their rejection of Jesus and his message and thus cannot be **speaking by the Spirit of God**. (2) The presence of **the Holy Spirit** in believers’ lives is shown by their sincere confession that **Jesus is Lord**. This is perhaps the earliest Christian creed (cp. *Rom 10:9*, *13*; *2 Cor 4:5*; *Phil 2:11*; *1 Jn 4:2-3*).\n\n
12:4	idm150876					 Though believers are united in the Lord and his Spirit, God gives **different kinds of spiritual gifts** to different people so that they can fulfill **different kinds of service** to **the same Lord** (see also *7:7*; *12:7-11*, *28-31*; *Rom 12:6-8*; *Eph 4:11*).\n\n
12:6	idm150890					 All the **work** believers do for God is in fact God working through them (see *15:10*; *2 Cor 4:7*; *Gal 2:8*; *Phil 2:13*; cp. *Gal 2:20*).\n\n
12:7	idm150902					 Spiritual gifts are not given for the individual recipients’ benefit but to **help each other** (cp. *1 Pet 4:10-11*).\n\n
12:8	idm150910					 This list of nine spiritual gifts is a representative rather than complete list (cp. *12:28-30*; *Rom 12:6-8*; *Eph 4:11*).\n\n
12:8	idm150919					 God’s **Spirit** gives supernatural wisdom or knowledge to some believers. • **gives a message of special knowledge:** cp. *1:5*; *8:1*; *13:2*, *8*.\n\n
12:9	idm150931					 The spiritual gift of **great faith** is not the faith required for salvation but an unusual ability to trust God for special needs (see *13:2*; *Matt 17:19-20*; cp. *Acts 6:5*; *11:24*).\n\n
12:10	idm150942					 **The ability to prophesy** does not refer primarily to predicting the future, but to speaking a special message directly from God (see *11:4-5*; *13:2*, *8*; *14:1-25*, *29-33*; *1 Thes 5:20*; cp. *Acts 13:1-2*; *21:4*, *10-11*). • **The ability to discern whether a message is from the Spirit of God or from another spirit** is a necessary gift for any Christian community that is open to hearing a word directly from God (see *1 Cor 14:29*; *1 Thes 5:19-21*; cp. *Acts 16:16-18*; *1 Jn 4:1-3*). • For Paul, the ability to speak **in unknown languages** here refers to spiritual language that requires the spiritual gift of interpretation in order to be understood. By placing this gift near the bottom of the list (both here and in *1 Cor 12:28*), Paul shows the lesser priority to be attached to the gift of tongues, with which the Corinthian church had become over-enamored (cp. *13:1*, *8*; *14:1-25*, *27*). • **The ability to interpret** does not refer to natural intellectual ability to translate, but to a spiritual ability to understand the meaning of the Spirit’s message communicated through the gift of tongues (see *14:5*, *13*, *26-28*).\n\n
12:11	idm150973					 The **Spirit . . . decides which gift each person should have:** See *12:4*, *6*, *18*, *28*. Paul paradoxically affirms both the sovereign choice of God in giving spiritual gifts and the human responsibility to “earnestly desire the most helpful gifts” (*12:31*).\n\n
12:12	idm150985					 The church is like a **body** (see *12:27*) composed of many different **parts***,* each with its own function as determined by God (see *12:11*, *18*, *28*; *Rom 12:4-5*).\n\n
12:13	idm150999					 Ethnic and social distinctions have no significance in the church (see *Gal 3:28*; *Col 3:11*). • **baptized into one body by one Spirit:** Water baptism symbolizes a spiritual baptism in which the believer is united with Christ and the church by the work of the Holy Spirit.\n\n
12:14	idm151008					 These verses move from the image of a physical body to the image of the church as a spiritual body. Every part of the body is important and essential to its proper functioning. Believers should neither boast of their spiritual ministry nor belittle it in comparison to the ministries of other believers. God, who made the body, **has put each part just where he wants it** (*12:18*).\n\n
12:22	idm151016					 The seemingly weaker and less significant parts of the body are **the most necessary** and should be given special attention and respect so that the whole body will function well.\n\n
12:25	idm151023					 The church is a unified body, so **harmony** and **care for each other** in the church is essential.\n\n
12:28	idm151031					 Paul lists some of the different individual roles given to people in the church (see also the list in *12:8-10*; cp. *Rom 12:6-8*; *Eph 4:11*).\n\n
12:28	idm151040					 **Apostles** are specially commissioned emissaries of Christ in the world (see also *Eph 4:11*). • **Prophets** speak a word from God (see *12:10* and *corresponding study note*; *Eph 4:11*; cp. *Acts 13:1-2*). • **Teachers** instruct others in the faith (*Rom 12:7*; *Eph 4:11*; cp. *Acts 13:1*). • **those who speak in unknown languages:** See *study note on 12:10*.\n\n
12:29	idm151059					 These rhetorical questions all expect the answer, **Of course not!** Paul gently rebukes those who are jealous of others. Believers are to gratefully accept the gifts God has given them, and not to envy other gifts or elevate any gifts as more important than others (but see *12:31*).\n\n
12:31	idm151067					 Believers are to **earnestly desire the most helpful gifts***,* those that have the greatest potential to build up the church (see *14:12*), while realizing that God is the one who distributes gifts as he chooses (*12:11*, *18*, *28*). Paul encourages the Corinthians to move beyond their desire for the gift of tongues (cp. *14:1-25*, *27*; see *12:10*) because it has the least potential, of all the gifts, to build up the church. • **But now let me show you:** This statement transitions to Paul’s description of love in *13:1-13*. Love is **a way of life that is best of all**.\n\n
13:1	idm151085					 Paul interrupts his discussion of spiritual gifts (resumed in ch *14*) to emphasize that **love** is more important than any spiritual gift (cp. *8:1-3*). The most important thing for Christians is to become deeply and consistently loving people.\n\n
13:1	idm151094					 Spiritual gifts in themselves do not define our worth to God or to the church. In fact, apart from the expression of **love***,* spiritual gifts are of no value.\n\n
13:1	idm151102					 **all the languages of earth** (literally *the tongues of men*) **and of angels:** Tongues was the spiritual gift most highly prized by the Corinthians (see also *12:10*, *28*; *14:1-25*, *27*). Some may have thought tongues to be the language of **angels***;* in Acts, Luke uses the same term to refer to natural human languages (see *Acts 2:4-13*).\n\n
13:2	idm151118					 **If I . . . possessed all knowledge** possibly refers to the gift of “special knowledge” (*12:8*).\n\n
13:3	idm151126					 **sacrificed my body, I could boast about it:** Some manuscripts read *sacrificed my body to be burned;* it would have been easy for a copyist to change the text accidentally, because in Greek the two readings differ only by one letter. It is unclear which reading is to be preferred; however, the manuscripts supporting the reading *I could boast* are generally better. • **I would have gained nothing:** Even the most impressive sacrificial acts mean nothing if not motivated by love.\n\n
13:4	idm151136					 This description of Christian love emphasizes the willingness to give up one’s own desires for the good of others (see also *8:1–10:33*; *Rom 5:6-8*; *15:3*; *2 Cor 8:9*; *Phil 2:4-8*).\n\n
13:5	idm151147					 **It does not demand its own way:** Love is not self-centered, not concerned simply with its own interests (see *Phil 2:4-8*).\n\n
13:8	idm151155					 **Love***,* in contrast to spiritual gifts, **will last forever**.\n\n
13:8	idm151164					 **Love will last forever***,* because God is love (cp. *1 Jn 4:7-12*, *16*).\n\n
13:9	idm151174					 None of the spiritual gifts gives us full understanding; unlike love, they are all limited in their benefits.\n\n
13:12	idm151180					 The contrast between **now** and **then** is between this age and the coming age. • **Now we see things imperfectly, like puzzling reflections in a mirror:** In Paul’s day, mirrors were usually made of polished bronze, so the view was imperfect. Our perception in this life is limited and our understanding is **partial and incomplete**. • **then:** When the end comes and Christ establishes his eternal kingdom, **we will see everything with perfect clarity**. Then the spiritual gifts that give knowledge will be unnecessary.\n\n
13:13	idm151192					 **Faith, hope, and love** are more important than spiritual gifts because they **last forever** (see also *Rom 5:1-5*; *Gal 5:5-6*; *Col 1:4-5*; *1 Thes 1:3*; *5:8*). Of the three, **the greatest** . . . **is love***,* because love is the quintessential nature of God himself (see *1 Jn 4:7-12*, *16-21*). So love should epitomize our relationship with him and others.\n\n
14:1	idm151210					 Having emphasized the supreme importance of **love** (ch *13*), Paul returns to the subject of spiritual gifts. Their relative value is defined by the benefit they give to others, which is characteristic of love (ch *13*). In that light, Paul contrasts the over-valued gift of tongues with the more beneficial gift of prophecy.\n\n
14:1	idm151219					 Of all **the special abilities the Spirit gives** (see *study note on 12:1–14:40*), Paul encourages the Corinthians to seek **the ability to prophesy** (see *12:10*) because of its greater benefit to the church.\n\n
14:2	idm151229					 The problem with the gift of speaking **in tongues** is that hearers cannot readily **understand** the message; the gift of **prophecy***,* however, is immediately intelligible and beneficial as a word from God that **strengthens . . . encourages . . . and comforts** those who hear.\n\n
14:4	idm151240					 The primary purpose of spiritual gifts is not self-edification, but the strengthening of **the entire church** (see *12:7*; cp. *8:1*; *14:12*).\n\n
14:7	idm151250					 A message needs to be clearly intelligible if it is to communicate effectively.\n\n
14:12	idm151256					 **Special abilities** from **the Spirit** are given to **strengthen the whole church** (see *12:7*; *14:4*; cp. *Eph 4:15-16*).\n\n
14:13	idm151268					 Paul does not forbid speaking in **tongues** (see *14:39*), but **the ability to interpret** is crucial, especially in public worship (see *14:27-28*).\n\n
14:14	idm151278					 Speaking in tongues engages the **spirit** of the speaker (because the Holy Spirit is speaking through the person) but not his mind (because the message is not rationally intelligible).\n\n
14:15	idm151285					 It is preferable both to worship **in the spirit** and to use **words I understand** in worship and ministry because public worship should always bless both God and others. Speaking in tongues without interpretation, though it gives glory to God and edification to the speaker (*14:4*), fails to benefit others who are present. • **praise God along with you** (literally *say “amen” to your thanksgiving*): *Amen* was the traditional congregational response to a prayer.\n\n
14:18	idm151297					 Paul affirmed the personal value of speaking **in tongues***,* but speaking **in a church meeting** should **help others***,* not only the speaker.\n\n
14:20	idm151308					 To **be mature in understanding** such **matters***,* one must consider the purpose of spiritual gifts and not treat them as ends in themselves for one’s own enjoyment.\n\n
14:21	idm151317					 Paul used this quotation from *Isa 28:11-12* to show that **speaking in tongues is a sign, not for believers, but for unbelievers**. However, in *1 Cor 14:23-25*, Paul argues that even unbelievers are more likely to be convicted by a word of prophecy than by speaking in tongues. His point is that, in public worship, the gift of prophecy is of greater usefulness than the gift of tongues.\n\n
14:25	idm151326					 **“God is truly here among you.”** Paul is alluding to *Isa 45:14*.\n\n
14:26	idm151334					 Paul gives specific procedures for the use of spiritual gifts in the church and emphasizes that they are to be expressed in an orderly way. Among the early Christians, **church meetings** were not led by professional pastors or priests. Instead, everyone shared with the others what God had given them for strengthening the church.\n\n
14:26	idm151341					 **will sing:** Literally *has a psalm*, either to be sung alone or for the fellowship to sing together (cp. *Eph 5:19*; *Col 3:16*). • **Everything that is done** in public worship is to be for the purpose of strengthening the church (see *1 Cor 12:7*; *14:4*, *6*, *12*, *26*; cp. *8:1*).\n\n
14:27	idm151358					 For a church overly eager for the gift of **tongues** (see *12:10*), Paul places limits on its public expression so it would be most helpful to the church: **no more than two or three,** . . . **one at a time***,* and only if there is someone present **who can interpret** the message.\n\n
14:29	idm151370					 Public **prophesying** is to be expressed in an orderly way, sensitive to the guidance of the Spirit, so that everyone may benefit from it. **The others** are then to **evaluate what is said** to assess whether it is indeed a word from God (*1 Thes 5:19-21*). Those with a word of prophecy are to **take turns**—prophecy is a divinely given word, but it is still subject to the **control** of the speaker.\n\n
14:34	idm151382					 This aside in the discussion on using spiritual gifts reflects a perspective on women’s roles similar to that of the Pastoral Letters (see *1 Tim 2:11-15*). • Paul advises women to **be silent** and **submissive** in church meetings. This instruction is to be understood in light of *1 Cor 11:5*, which clearly implies that women are permitted to pray and prophesy publicly. • **just as the law says:** Possibly referring to *Gen 3:16*.\n\n
14:36	idm151394					 Paul expected the Corinthians to take his apostolic word seriously, as **a command from the Lord himself**. • **What I am saying** probably refers to all of his teaching, especially as it relates to spiritual gifts.\n\n
14:39	idm151402					 Paul summarizes his discussion of spiritual gifts (chs *12–14*).\n\n
15:1	idm151409					 Some people in the church had doubts about a future **resurrection of the dead**. Paul reassures them and, perhaps in response to their skeptical questions, discusses the nature of a resurrection body.\n\n
15:1	idm151416					 Paul summarizes the Good News that he preached.\n\n
15:1	idm151422					 At the heart of **the Good News** stands the message of the atoning death and resurrection of Christ (see *15:3-4*; *Rom 5:8-10*; *6:5-11*).\n\n
15:2	idm151432					 **if you continue to believe:** Those who continue firm in their faith will be saved (cp. *Matt 10:22*; *24:13*; *John 15:6*; *Gal 5:4*; *Col 1:23*; *Heb 6:4-6*; contrast *1 Cor 1:8*; *Rom 8:38-39*; *Phil 1:6*; *Heb 6:9*).\n\n
15:3	idm151449					 The heart of the Good News is that **Christ died for our sins** (see *Rom 3:24-25*; *5:8-10*; *Gal 1:4*; *1 Thes 5:9-10*).\n\n
15:4	idm151460					 **just as the Scriptures said:** See *Ps 16:10*; *Hos 6:2*; *Jon 1:17*; *Matt 12:40*; *Acts 2:24-32*.\n\n
15:5	idm151472					 **He was seen by Peter:** See *Luke 24:34*. • **then by the Twelve:** See *Matt 28:16-17*; *Mark 16:14*; *Luke 24:36*; *John 20:19*.\n\n
15:6	idm151485					 **he was seen by more than 500:** We have no other account of this event. • **most of whom are still alive:** When this letter was written (around AD 53–56), the factuality of Christ’s resurrection could be verified by consulting living eyewitnesses.\n\n
15:7	idm151494					 This **James** was almost certainly Jesus’ brother, who became a leader of the Jerusalem church after Jesus’ death (see *Mark 6:3*; *John 7:1-5*; *Gal 1:19*; cp. *Acts 12:17*; *15:13*; *21:18*).\n\n
15:8	idm151507					 **as though I had been born at the wrong time** (or *as though I were stillborn*): This phrase can refer to a miscarriage or stillbirth. Here it might express the unusual manner of Paul’s conversion, or the derogatory view some opponents held of his apostleship, or his own sense of unworthiness to be an apostle. The overall emphasis is on the extraordinary grace of God to Paul as a former persecutor of Christ’s people (see *Gal 1:13*; *Phil 3:6*; cp. *Acts 8:3*; *9:1-2*). • **I also saw him:** Paul came face to face with the risen Christ at his conversion (see *1 Cor 9:1*; *Acts 9:3-6*; *Gal 1:15-16*).\n\n
15:10	idm151523					 Paul’s awareness of God’s extraordinary **special favor** (literally *grace*) to him resulted in an extraordinary response on his part. But even that must be understood as an expression of **God . . . working through me by his grace** (see *2 Cor 4:7*; *Gal 2:20*; *Col 1:27*).\n\n
15:11	idm151535					 The important thing is the **message***,* not the messengers (cp. *1:10-12*).\n\n
15:12	idm151544					 Paul now makes the case for a future **resurrection**.\n\n
15:12	idm151551					 Christ’s resurrection confirms the reality of the future resurrection.\n\n
15:12	idm151557					 Some believers in Corinth apparently had a difficult time accepting the Jewish notion of a bodily **resurrection of the dead***,* preferring instead the Greek notion of the immortality of the soul (cp. *Acts 17:18*, *32*).\n\n
15:14	idm151567					 If Christ has not risen from the dead, then Christian **faith is useless**. But in reality, Jesus’ resurrection is proof that the sacrifice of Christ fully atoned for human sins (see *15:3*). **If Christ has not been raised***,* then human beings remain unforgiven, under the judgment of God—**still guilty of** their **sins** (see *Rom 3:19*; *Eph 2:1-3*).\n\n
15:19	idm151581					 Without eternal life, faithful believers **are more to be pitied than anyone in the world** because they suffer persecution and deprivation. But they find their joy in anticipating what lies beyond this life, as did both Jesus (see *Heb 12:2*) and Paul (see *2 Cor 4:16-18*; *Phil 1:21-23*; *3:7-11*).\n\n
15:20	idm151592					 In the Old Testament, the first crop was dedicated to God (see *Exod 23:19*). Christ’s resurrection is **the first of a great harvest** of God’s people who will be resurrected (see *Col 1:18*).\n\n
15:21	idm151601					 Adam’s sin contrasts with Christ’s resurrection (cp. *15:45-49*).\n\n
15:24	idm151608					 Christ is the Lord of all things, even **death** itself. Nevertheless, he remains subordinate to **God** his **Father**.\n\n
15:24	idm151617					 The phrase **every ruler and authority and power** refers to spiritual powers who oppose Christ (cp. *Rom 8:38*; *Eph 1:21*; *Col 2:10*, *15*; *1 Pet 3:22*).\n\n
15:25	idm151629					 This paraphrase of *Ps 110:1* is applied to Jesus (cp. *Heb 1:13*). • **beneath his feet:** In the ancient Near East, victorious kings were depicted with their feet on the necks of their defeated enemies.\n\n
15:27	idm151638					 **“God has put all things under his authority”:** See *Ps 8:6*; cp. *Matt 22:44*.\n\n
15:29	idm151647					 Some first-century Christians apparently practiced baptism-by-proxy for dead unbelievers whom they wished to be saved. Paul neither endorses nor condemns the practice; he simply uses it as evidence for belief in resurrection. There is no other reference to such a practice in early Christian literature.\n\n
15:30	idm151653					 The apostles’ willingness to **risk** their **lives** was based on their conviction that there is life beyond death. If there is no resurrection, such suffering is pointless.\n\n
15:32	idm151661					 **fighting wild beasts—those people of Ephesus:** Paul refers figuratively to his struggles with opponents in Ephesus (see *16:8*; *Acts 19:23-41*; *2 Cor 1:8*; *4:8-12*; *11:23-28*). Watching condemned prisoners *fighting wild beasts* and getting mauled to death was a common form of entertainment in the Roman world.\n\n
15:33	idm151674					 **“bad company corrupts good character”:** This quotation from the Greek poet Menander (300s BC) is a warning not to listen to those who are teaching wrong things.\n\n
15:34	idm151682					 **some of you don’t know God at all:** Paul sharply rebukes those who prided themselves on their knowledge but remained skeptical of resurrection.\n\n
15:35	idm151689					 Paul discusses the nature of resurrection **bodies***,* perhaps responding to skeptical questions. In the Greco-Roman world, belief in the immortality of the soul was common, but not belief in the resurrection of the body.\n\n
15:36	idm151697					 **What a foolish question!** Paul’s strong response suggests that the question is skeptical. It might also imply that the answer is unknowable.\n\n
15:37	idm151704					 Just as the shape of a **plant** does not resemble the seed, yet the plant’s growth is determined by the kind of seed, so the resurrection body will be unlike the present body, yet identifiable as belonging to the same person.\n\n
15:40	idm151711					 Everything that God has made has its own **glory**—its own unique beauty and magnificence. The resurrection body will be unlike anything else.\n\n
15:42	idm151718					 Just as growing plants differ from the seeds out of which they sprout, so resurrection bodies will be vastly unlike our mortal bodies.\n\n
15:45	idm151724					 **Adam** and **Christ** founded two distinct humanities: One is natural and earthly, enslaved to sin and death; the other is spiritual and heavenly, purified and destined for life. Adam represents **the natural** (physical) **body** and Christ **the spiritual** (resurrection) **body**. See also *15:21-22*; *Rom 5:12-21*.\n\n
15:45	idm151738					 Just as Christ’s **life-giving Spirit** supersedes the natural life, the spiritual body will supersede the physical body.\n\n
15:47	idm151745					 **made from the dust of the earth:** Adam’s earthly origin (*Gen 2:7*) is here contrasted with Christ’s heavenly origin.\n\n
15:48	idm151753					 **Earthly people** (literally *those of the dust*): Like Adam, natural human beings are under the curse of sin and death. All return to dust (see *Gen 3:19*)—they all die. • **heavenly people are like the heavenly man:** Those who belong to Christ are like him in having an unending spiritual life.\n\n
15:49	idm151763					 Like **the earthly man,** Adam, we have physical bodies in this life. But **we will someday be like** Christ, **the heavenly man***,* experiencing the Kingdom of God in resurrection bodies (cp. *Rom 6:4-14*).\n\n
15:50	idm151774					 **Physical bodies cannot inherit** God’s Kingdom. Only a spiritual, resurrected body can experience the Kingdom in all its fullness (cp. *John 4:24*).\n\n
15:51	idm151782					 The Good News reveals the previously unknown **secret** of resurrection. • **We will not all die:** Paul might have expected the future resurrection in his own lifetime (cp. *15:52*; *1 Thes 4:15*, *17*).\n\n
15:52	idm151793					 Cp. *1 Thes 4:13-17*.\n\n
15:54	idm151800					 **“Death is swallowed up in victory”:** Resurrection defeats the ultimate enemy, **death***,* just as the power of the Spirit enables believers to transcend sin here and now (see *Rom 8:2*, *11*).\n\n
15:55	idm151811					 This quotation (*Hos 13:14*) assures believers that they have nothing to fear from **death**. • Death is like the **sting** of a scorpion.\n\n
15:57	idm151820					 The death and resurrection of Christ ends the dominating power of **sin** and **death** (see *Rom 6:14*; *8:2*; *10:4*).\n\n
15:58	idm151831					 **Nothing you do for the Lord is ever useless:** There will be eternal rewards for those who serve him faithfully (see *3:12-15*).\n\n
16:1	idm151839					 Paul answers the Corinthians’ **question** about the offering for poor Christians **in Jerusalem** (*Acts 24:17*; *Rom 15:25-27*; *2 Cor 8–9*; *Gal 2:10*).\n\n
16:1	idm151851					 **Galatia** was a Roman province in Asia Minor (see *Acts 16:6*; *18:23*).\n\n
16:2	idm151860					 Christians met **on the first day of each week** (see *Acts 20:7*) rather than the last day of the week, as in the Old Testament (*Exod 20:8*; *34:21*; *Isa 58:13-14*). The first day was the “Lord’s Day,” the day of the Lord’s resurrection (*Mark 16:9*; *Luke 24:13-15*; *John 20:19*; *Rev 1:10*). • The **portion of the money you have earned** is not specified; Paul later encouraged them to give as generously as they could (*2 Cor 8:1-4*; *9:6-13*; cp. *Luke 12:33-34*; *21:1-4*; *1 Tim 6:18-19*).\n\n
16:4	idm151881					 Paul did in fact deliver the gift to Jerusalem (*Rom 15:25-26*).\n\n
16:5	idm151888					 Paul had traveled through **Macedonia,** a Roman province in the northern region of Greece, on his second missionary journey (*Acts 15:36–18:22*). • **planning to travel through Macedonia:** See *Acts 19:21*; *20:1-3*.\n\n
16:6	idm151899					 **possibly all winter:** Paul evidently made this visit (cp. *Acts 20:2-3*).\n\n
16:8	idm151907					 Paul wrote this letter while in **Ephesus** (about AD 53–56; *Acts 19:1–20:1*). • **Pentecost** was in May or June.\n\n
16:10	idm151917					 **When Timothy comes:** See *4:17*. Timothy was Paul’s child in the faith and co-worker (see *1 Tim 1:2*). • **don’t intimidate him:** Timothy may have been shy (*2 Tim 1:6-8*).\n\n
16:11	idm151928					 **Apollos:** See *study note on 1:12*.\n\n
16:17	idm151936					 Together with **Stephanas** (see also *1:16*; *16:15*), **Fortunatus** and **Achaicus** had apparently traveled from Corinth to visit Paul in Ephesus.\n\n
16:19	idm151947					 As in other letters, Paul greets his friends and gives a benediction.\n\n
16:19	idm151953					 **Aquila** and **Priscilla** (Greek *Prisca*) had previously moved from Corinth to Ephesus, where Paul was writing this letter (cp. *Acts 18:1-3*). • **gather in their home:** Aquila and Priscilla later continued this practice in Rome (see *Rom 16:3-5*).\n\n
16:20	idm151965					 **a sacred kiss:** A kiss on the cheek was a common greeting.\n\n
16:21	idm151972					 Paul takes up the pen and signs the letter in his **own handwriting**. As was common, Paul used a secretary to write this letter and others (see *Rom 16:22*; *Gal 6:11*; *Col 4:18*; *2 Thes 3:17*).\n\n
16:22	idm151983					 To be **cursed** is to be condemned by God (see also *Rom 9:3*; *Gal 1:8-9*). • **Our Lord, come!** This phrase was sometimes used in early Christian prayers (see also *Rev 22:20*).\n\n
16:23	idm151994					 All of Paul’s letters close with a benediction similar to this one. • Paul invokes **grace** at both the beginning and the end of this letter (see *1:3*).\n\n
