1:1	idm112573					 **message . . . vision:** This opening, similar to that of other prophetic books (cp. *Obad 1:1*; *Hab 1:1*; *Mal 1:1*), identifies Nahum as a prophet, one who uttered messages from God. • **Nineveh** became the capital of the Assyrian Empire sometime shortly after 705 BC and remained so until its destruction in 612 BC. • The name **Nahum** means “comfort” or “encouragement.” An important theme of his prophecy is that God will bring encouragement to his people through Nineveh’s downfall (*Nah 1:12-15*; see *Isa 40:1*).\n\n
1:2	idm112589					 This short, two-stanza hymn (*1:2-6*, *7-11*) tells of God’s sovereign power.\n\n
1:2	idm112597					 The hymn’s first stanza draws from biblical texts commemorating Israel’s exodus from Egypt. The message is that everything in all creation is subject to God’s sovereign power, and God will ensure the punishment of those **who oppose him**.\n\n
1:2	idm112604					 **jealous** (or *zealous*): God zealously guards the welfare of his people and zealously desires their faithfulness (see *Exod 20:4-5*; *Deut 4:23-24*; *6:4*; *Jer 2:1–3:5*). • God’s **vengeance and rage** cannot be confused with the human attitude of “getting even.” God’s actions emerge from his holiness (*Jer 50:28-29*), justice (*Isa 63:1-9*), and faithfulness to the covenant with his people (*Lev 26:23-25*; *Isa 1:24-26*). His vengeance is never arbitrary.\n\n
1:3	idm112621					 **slow to get angry:** God’s patience with disobedience is linked to his faithful love (*Exod 34:6*; *Num 14:18*; *Ps 103:8*; *Joel 2:13*). This trait had disappointed Jonah, who wanted Nineveh destroyed immediately (*Jon 4:2*). Because God is patient, he sometimes delays the deserved punishment of sinners (*Neh 9:29-30*; *Rom 2:4*; *2 Pet 3:9*), but those **guilty** of persisting in sin will ultimately face God’s judgment (*Exod 34:7*; *Rom 14:10*; *2 Cor 5:10*; *Rev 14:6-7*). • **the whirlwind and the storm:** This imagery describes the fury of God’s judgment against the wicked (see also *Isa 29:6*).\n\n
1:4	idm112643					 Like clouds (*1:3*) and mountains (*1:5*), **oceans** and **rivers** are under God’s sovereign control. The Old Testament prophets often recall God’s actions against the seas and rivers during the Exodus (*Exod 15:8-10*; *2 Sam 22:16*; *Pss 66:6*; *77:16*; *Hab 3:15*). God’s power over the waters repudiated the mythology of the ancient Canaanites, who believed that the oceans and the rivers were under the control of the sea-god, Yam. • **Bashan,** situated east of the Sea of Galilee, was known for its rich pastureland, ideal for raising cattle (cp. *Mic 7:14*). • **Carmel***,* on the Mediterranean coast in central Canaan, was noted for its beauty and fruitfulness (*Song 7:5*; *Jer 50:19*). • **Lebanon** was famed for its great cedars (*1 Kgs 5:6-18*). Nahum lists these areas to demonstrate that even the most fertile and productive places on earth cannot withstand the power of God’s judgment.\n\n
1:5	idm112666					 Old Testament poetry often mentions the shaking of **the earth** to commemorate the Exodus period (e.g., *Ps 18:7*; *Hab 3:6*; see *Exod 19:18*).\n\n
1:6	idm112676					 The Hebrew word translated **rage** is repeated from *1:2*. Its repetition brackets *1:2-6* as a single poetic unit.\n\n
1:7	idm112685					 This second stanza (see *study note on 1:2-11*) concentrates on God’s sovereignty, righteousness, and justice in dealing with all people.\n\n
1:7	idm112692					 **The** Lord** is good:** God acts equitably when he judges the wicked. He also provides **refuge** for **those who trust in him**. He accepts them and protects them in the midst of life’s trials (*Pss 18:2*; *62:5-7*). God’s rich goodness can lead individuals to repentance (*Rom 2:2-4*).\n\n
1:8	idm112706					 **overwhelming flood:** A metaphor for the powerful nature of God’s judgment (see *2:6*).\n\n
1:9	idm112714					 **Why are you scheming:** No scheme or human plot against God can succeed. Human plans are worthless if they do not match God’s plans (*Ps 2*; *Isa 14:26-27*; *23:9*).\n\n
1:11	idm112724					 The **wicked counselor** is the Assyrian king. God had also dealt with the arrogant conceit of an Assyrian king in Hezekiah’s time (about 701 BC; see *2 Kgs 19:35-36*). Assyria’s *wicked counselor* contrasts with the coming Messiah, the King who is a “Wonderful Counselor” (*Isa 9:6*).\n\n
1:12	idm112735					 The Assyrians’ **allies** were vassal or subordinate kingdoms, including once-powerful Egypt. Ironically, a coalition of former allies gradually brought down the great Neo-Assyrian Empire between 625 and 605 BC. • **O my people** refers to Judah, whom God had **punished** earlier when the Assyrian king Sennacherib (704–681 BC) launched a campaign (701 BC) against the western states of the Near East. While Sennacherib failed to take Jerusalem (*2 Kgs 19:32-36*), he boasted in his annals of carrying away Jerusalem’s tribute and an enormous amount of spoils from forty-six cities in Judah. Although Judah was now reduced to vassalage and faced the constant possibility of Assyrian aggression, Assyria did not defeat the southern kingdom. Babylon did so, however, in 586 BC. Sadly, neither Israel nor Judah heeded God’s repeated warnings that failure to repent would result in judgment (*Hos 11:5*; *Joel 2:1-27*).\n\n
1:14	idm112751					 **no more children:** Nineveh would be completely annihilated. Cutting off a person’s **name** and leaving him without a descendant meant utterly destroying him (*1 Sam 24:21*; *Job 18:17*; *Isa 14:22*). • None of Assyria’s venerated **gods** could deliver Nineveh from God’s death sentence. • God was already **preparing a grave** for Nineveh and directing Assyria’s enemies to destroy the city. Assyria’s proud cities fell one by one to the combined attacks of the Chaldeans, the Medes, and the Ummanmanda. Nineveh itself fell in 612 BC.\n\n
1:15	idm112765					 Nahum supplements his prophecy of Judah’s release from bondage (*1:13*) with a prediction of the arrival of a **messenger** bringing the **good news** of restored peace (see also *Isa 52:7*). The **message of peace** was that Assyria’s hold on Judah would be broken and God’s people would be free of its burden. This took place during the reign of Josiah (640–609 BC), after the death of the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal in 626 BC. This political message is a foretaste of God’s final triumph over evil, when his people will be released from bondage to sin through the saving work of the Messiah and be given eternal peace (*Zeph 3:13*; *Luke 2:10-14*; *Acts 10:34-43*; *Rom 10:15*; *Eph 2:14-18*).\n\n
2:1	idm112783					 Although Nineveh’s defenders might fully prepare to protect the city with **ramparts . . . roads . . . defenses***,* and **forces,** their efforts were doomed to failure (*1:1-14*).\n\n
2:2	idm112793					 The **vine** symbolizes God’s blessing his people (*Isa 27:2-6*), while the **stripped** vine reflects God’s previous chastisement of them (*Isa 5:1-7*). The children of Israel were in a sad state compared to the days of the great kings David and Solomon, but God promised to **restore** the **splendor** of his people.\n\n
2:4	idm112805					 **Chariots** were virtually unstoppable in battle because of their maneuverability and power.\n\n
2:5	idm112812					 The Assyrian king overcomes the initial shock of Nineveh’s being attacked and **shouts to his officers**. He and the city have been caught off guard and they rush **to the walls** to thwart the siege. • **to set up their defenses** (literally *the covering is prepared*): The meaning of the Hebrew term here is uncertain. *Covering* probably refers to something the attackers or the defenders used to protect themselves from armaments hurled through the air.\n\n
2:6	idm112823					 The rush to defend (*2:5*) comes too late; the defenses are already breached. • Nineveh was served by a reservoir formed by a double dam on the Khosr River, a tributary of the Tigris that flowed through the city. The reservoir was augmented by a series of flood **gates**. The Greek historian Diodorus reported that during this time torrential rains had already swelled the city’s river system. By first closing, then opening the flood gates, Nineveh’s attackers released the pent-up water as a battering ram against the city walls.\n\n
2:7	idm112831					 Because **Nineveh’s exile** had **been decreed** by God, it would certainly happen. • To **beat their breasts** was a common sign of mourning (see, e.g., *Luke 18:13*).\n\n
2:8	idm112841					 The people would run away as fast as water flows from a breached **reservoir** (see *study note on 2:6*).\n\n
2:9	idm112849					 The **vast, uncounted wealth** of other nations poured into the Assyrian capital as trade, tribute, and spoils, but it was gone in an instant. Ruthless aggression and wickedness may succeed temporarily, but ultimately they will be destroyed (*Prov 13:22*; *Obad 1:15*; *Luke 12:16-20*).\n\n
2:10	idm112859					 **plundered, empty, and ruined:** The Hebrew here is alliterated for effect: *buqah umbuqah umbullaqah*. The effect might be translated into English as “devastated, despoiled, and destroyed.”\n\n
2:11	idm112867					 Following the description of Nineveh’s fall (*2:1-10*), Nahum inserts the first of three taunt songs (see also *3:8-13*, *14-19*; this was a common form in the ancient Near East). In biting satire, he compares Nineveh to a lion’s **den**. King Sennacherib and other Assyrian kings had compared themselves to **lions***,* even decorating their palaces with artistic representations of lions and of themselves on lion hunts. However, with God as its enemy, Nineveh would no longer be the lair of an invincible predator.\n\n
2:13	idm112879					 Examples of the **voices** of Assyria’s **proud messengers** are found in *2 Kgs 18:19–19:13*.\n\n
3:1	idm112888					 **city of murder:** The Assyrians’ graphic cruelty is well documented. Their practices included cutting off external body parts—such as noses, ears, hands, and feet—and execution by impalement on stakes. They heaped up severed heads before the gates of besieged cities. The eyes of victims might also be put out and their skin stripped from their bodies while they were still alive.\n\n
3:2	idm112895					 These short, staccato phrases dramatize the effects of seeing and hearing the battle. • Assyrian **chariots** and **charioteers** were feared far and wide.\n\n
3:4	idm112903					 **mistress of deadly charms:** The Assyrians charmed other nations with wealth and promises of safety and prosperity but then victimized them through military might and economic exploitation. Therefore, their punishment was a just recompense for their deeds (see *Prov 24:12*; *Joel 3:4-8*; *Rev 18:6*; *20:12*).\n\n
3:5	idm112914					 Twice God tells Nineveh, **I am your enemy** (also *2:13*). Nineveh’s judgment stands as a historical reminder that the Lord abhors sin and will deal with people and nations according to their deeds (*Pss 9:7-8*; *62:12*; *Jer 46:28*; *Acts 17:31*). One day, God’s justice will fall worldwide on those who have rebelled against him (*Rev 17–19*).\n\n
3:8	idm112927					 **Thebes***,* the historic capital of Egypt, was situated on both sides of the Nile in Upper Egypt. It achieved its greatest fame as the political, religious, and cultural center of Egypt’s great New Kingdom (1550–1069 BC). Though no longer Egypt’s capital in the 600s BC, the city was still a thriving metropolis.\n\n
3:9	idm112937					 **Thebes fell** to the Assyrians under King Ashurbanipal in 663 BC. Before Ashurbanipal’s victory, Thebes had seemed to have unconquerable defenses, as well as the help of all Egypt and its allies: **Ethiopia***,* **Put** (perhaps the fabled land of Punt, located near what is now coastal Somalia), and **Libya**. None of these, however, had effectively protected Thebes. • **babies were dashed to death:** Ancient conquerors had the heinous practice of exterminating the infants of their enemies in this way (*2 Kgs 8:12*; *Ps 137:9*; *Isa 13:16*, *18*). • **Soldiers threw dice** for the spoils of war, while the **leaders** of the conquered people **were bound in chains** (see *2 Kgs 25:7*; *Jer 40:1*, *4*; *Joel 3:3*; *Obad 1:11*).\n\n
3:12	idm112962					 **ripe figs:** Cp. *Amos 8:1-2*; *Rev 6:13*.\n\n
3:14	idm112971					 **Get ready . . . Strengthen:** Nahum used sarcasm to stress that no amount of preparation would make the Assyrians able to withstand God’s wrath (note also the sarcastic tone of *2:11-13*).\n\n
3:15	idm112979					 The Old Testament often uses **locusts** as a metaphor for armies (see *Joel 2:1-11*).\n\n
3:16	idm112987					 Assyrian **merchants** had spread throughout the Near East like **locusts**, filling Nineveh with untold wealth. But just as locusts desire only to satisfy their insatiable appetites and then fly off, the merchants would take their goods and go in the time of Nineveh’s distress, leaving a needy populace behind.\n\n
3:18	idm112995					 **shepherds:** With the leaders gone, Nineveh’s **people** would be **scattered** like sheep. • **lie dead** (literally *sleep*; see *John 11:11-14*): Assyria’s leaders, asleep during Nineveh’s crisis, would sleep in death. By contrast, Israel’s Shepherd does not slumber (*Ps 121:3*), and he will gather Israel’s lost sheep (*Jer 23:3*; *Ezek 36:35*).\n\n
3:19	idm113010					 Nineveh deserved **destruction** rather than **healing**. Although God had been patient with Nineveh in Jonah’s day (*Jon 3:10*), the Assyrians had returned to **cruelty** and would reap the harvest of their own evil (see *Prov 11:16-19*; *Isa 66:5-6*; *Hos 8:7*). Those who had **suffered** under Assyria’s **cruelty** would welcome this message with **joy**.\n\n
