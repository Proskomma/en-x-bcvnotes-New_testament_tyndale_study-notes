1:1	idm81384					 **These are the visions** (literally *The vision*): This term introduces the book as a unified whole, covering Isaiah’s prophecies over a period of some fifty-five years (about 740–685 BC). • **Isaiah son of Amoz:** Beyond this, nothing is known of Isaiah’s family background. • **Jerusalem***,* the capital city of **Judah***,* was the center of Isaiah’s ministry. However, some of his prophecies also relate to the northern kingdom, Israel (referred to as Samaria and Ephraim, *9:8-21*; *28:1-13*), which fell in 722 BC (see *2 Kgs 17*).\n\n
1:2	idm81402					 **heavens . . . earth:** All of creation is called to witness the trial that God convened against Judah (cp. *Deut 31:28*; *32:1*).\n\n
1:3	idm81411					 **an ox knows its owner:** Not so with Judah. Yet despite their rebellion, God still graciously addressed them as **my people.**\n\n
1:4	idm81419					 The expression **Holy One of Israel** is frequently used in Isaiah as a title for the Lord. God is the righteous and just King of heaven and earth (*6:3-5*), the incomparable God (*40:25*), and the Redeemer of his people (*43:14*). It was a terrible and foolish sin for Judah to reject him.\n\n
1:5	idm81429					 God sent famine, war, disease, and death as **punishment**. In most cases, however, God wanted to change stubborn behavior rather than simply to punish. • As a result of their persistent rebellion, the people’s **head is injured** and their **heart is sick**. The nation was wounded physically from Assyrian aggression, while spiritually they were defiled and overtaken by sin (*64:6*).\n\n
1:6	idm81439					 **without any soothing ointments or bandages:** Judah’s national condition was like the body of an injured person who had not received medical care.\n\n
1:7	idm81446					 **country . . . towns:** By 701 BC, the Assyrians had destroyed the infrastructure, taken cities, and ravaged the fields (see *64:10*). This fulfilled Isaiah’s prophetic word (*6:11-13*). Those who survived this Assyrian onslaught would know by experience to heed later warnings of exile to Babylon (*39:6-7*). God does what he says he will do, so the warning of God’s judgment on all the nations is certain.\n\n
1:8	idm81457					 **Beautiful Jerusalem** (Hebrew *The daughter of Zion*): Zion, one of the hills on which Jerusalem stands, often served as a synonym for Jerusalem. Zion carried with it the notion of God’s presence (*Ps 46*), his protection of his people, and Jerusalem’s resistance to enemy forces. Now, however, the opposite was true. Jerusalem had become weak, **like a helpless city under siege** and like an **abandoned . . . shelter** or **lean-to**.\n\n
1:9	idm81469					 **The** Lord** of Heaven’s Armies** refers to the millions of angels that are at the Lord’s command (see *2 Kgs 6:16-17*; *Matt 26:53*). At the Exodus, Moses described God as a warrior fighting for his people (*Exod 15:1-21*). Ironically, in Isaiah’s day, God fought against Judah because of their wickedness (*Isa 1:24*; *3:1-5*).\n\n
1:10	idm81483					 **Listen to** (literally *listen to the word of*) **the** Lord**:** In this context, *listen* means to respond in obedience to **the law** (or *teaching;* Hebrew *torah*) **of our God** (see *2:3*; *5:24*). • **leaders . . . people:** All levels of society were guilty. • Like **Sodom** and **Gomorrah***,* Jerusalem had come under divine judgment for its rebellion against God’s laws. Jerusalem might have been utterly destroyed like those cities were it not for God’s grace (*1:9*; see *Gen 19*).\n\n
1:11	idm81507					 The people had so offended God through their sin that he took **no pleasure** any more in their **sacrifices**. The Lord wanted Judah to stop the religious exercises he had commanded them to do rather than to continue them in a manner that was **sinful and false** (*1:13*). Ritual is never an acceptable substitute for true godliness.\n\n
1:13	idm81517					 The **incense** that accompanied **offerings** was intended as a sweet fragrance to the Lord (see *Exod 30:7-8*), but when offered with hypocrisy it was a nauseating stench and an abomination to God. • While the Lord had ordered **special days for fasting** at the Temple (*Lev 16:31*; *23:32*; *Num 29:7*), they were ruined by the guilt of Judah’s sin (see *Isa 58:1-7*; *Matt 6:16-18*). • **pious meetings:** These holy days were associated with the new moon and other festivals (see *Lev 23*).\n\n
1:14	idm81534					 **New moon celebrations** occurred on the first day of each lunar month (*Num 28:11-15*) and included sacrifices, feasting, and rest from work. • The **annual festivals** were the festivals of Passover, Harvest, Trumpets, and Shelters (*Num 28:16–29:39*; *Deut 16:1-17*).\n\n
1:15	idm81545					 **I will not look . . . I will not listen:** The Lord does not respond to **prayer** offered from a life of persistent wickedness. In this case, God charged the people with perverting his laws in order to practice violent injustice toward **innocent victims**.\n\n
1:16	idm81554					 **Wash . . . and be clean!** The people were defiled by their sin and the uncleanness of their sacrifices. To be clean in God’s eyes, they needed to change their behavior, get rid of their **sins***,* and **give up** their **evil ways** (see also *1:18*).\n\n
1:17	idm81566					 Seeking **justice** means upholding God’s standards of fairness and advancing the rights of the **oppressed***,*** orphans***,* and** widows**—those who are weak and marginalized in society (see also *Jer 7:5-7*; *22:3*; *Zech 7:10*; *Matt 23:23*; *25:31-46*; *Jas 1:27*).\n\n
1:18	idm81584					 God called his people to **come** and **settle** their dispute so that he could restore his covenant relationship with them. This required Judah to make a decision between obeying or turning away (*1:19-20*). Isaiah says their **sins are like scarlet . . . they are red like crimson***,* the color of blood, which Judah had unjustly shed (*1:15*). • **white as snow . . . white as wool:** The people would be radically transformed—cleansed, purified, and made holy (see also *Ps 51:7*; *Dan 7:9*).\n\n
1:19	idm81599					 Repentance leads to life, whereas resisting God’s will and turning away from him results in death (see *Deut 11:26-28*; *28:1-62*).\n\n
1:20	idm81607					 **I, the** Lord**, have spoken!** This statement marks the solemnity of what God has just promised. The phrase is used eleven times in Isaiah.\n\n
1:21	idm81616					 The image of **Jerusalem** as **a prostitute** represents Judah’s unfaithfulness to God (see *Jer 3:6-14*; *Ezek 16:25-26*; *Hos 1–3*).\n\n
1:24	idm81627					 **The** Lord** of Heaven’s Armies, the Mighty One of Israel***,* was usually Israel’s protector (*31:5*). However, in this context, God was coming to **take revenge** against his own people, who by their wickedness had become his **enemies** and **foes**.\n\n
1:25	idm81641					 **I will raise my fist against you:** God, normally Israel’s protector, would become their attacker. However, he had a purpose beyond punishment. • **I will melt you down. . . . I will remove all your impurities:** God would use the Exile to remove the wicked from among his people and to refine those who would return.\n\n
1:26	idm81649					 The restoration of the community would be marked by new leaders who uphold justice rather than perverting it (see *1:23*). **Jerusalem** would **again** be pure silver (see *1:22*), **the Home of Justice and the Faithful City**.\n\n
1:27	idm81660					 Here, **Zion** refers to the remnant community. Only **those who repent** would receive God’s salvation and purification and would dwell in his presence. Zion was required to be the bastion of **justice** and **righteousness***,* for God loves righteousness. God expected the covenant community to reflect the holy standards he cares about.\n\n
1:29	idm81671					 The rebels (*1:28*), who practiced idolatry **in groves of sacred oaks** and **in gardens dedicated to idols***,* would become like drought-stricken oaks and gardens. They would lack the nourishing vitality of the true God’s presence. Those who followed the Canaanite fertility religion of Baal treated gardens and trees as sacred, believing that they brought blessings. Instead, they brought spiritual death.\n\n
2:1	idm81681					 **vision** (literally *word*): This heading (see *1:1*) likely introduces the revelation of chs *2–12*. The main focus of this section is on **Judah***,* but a handful of passages expand that focus to include the nations in general (*2:2-4*), humanity at large (*2:6-22*), Syria and the northern kingdom of Israel (chs *7–9*), and the Assyrians (ch *10*).\n\n
2:2	idm81697					 God’s gracious salvation would one day extend beyond Israel and Judah. This would prompt the nations to come to Zion, not in battle but to be blessed there and live by the rules of God’s kingdom. Isaiah encouraged Judah to look at the benefits that the nations would enjoy. He wanted to stimulate the people of Judah (*2:5*) to jealousy and provoke them to follow the Lord so that they would not be left out in that day. This section is repeated almost verbatim in *Micah 4:1-3*.\n\n
2:2	idm81705					 In the Old Testament, the expression **the last days** is a general reference to the future era (see *Jer 49:39*; *Ezek 38:16*; *Hos 3:5*); in the New Testament, it is used to refer to the period that began with the coming of the Lord Jesus (*Heb 1:2*) and more specifically to the period immediately preceding the end of the present age (*2 Pet 3:3*). • **The mountain of the** Lord**’s house** referred to the Temple Mount. This location symbolized God’s glorious exaltation (see *Isa 6:1*) and his kingdom on earth. Isaiah’s focus on God’s exalted and supreme kingship flows out of his famous vision of God (ch *6*). • Far from being a narrow nationalistic dream, Isaiah’s prophetic hope extended beyond Judah and Jerusalem to include **people from all over the world**.\n\n
2:3	idm81723					 Human society will undergo changes as people conform to God’s revelation and follow his **ways** and **paths**. • Judah received the revelation (**teaching . . . word**) but did not obey it (*1:10-15*); however, the nations will be ready to do God’s will.\n\n
2:4	idm81733					 The Kingdom of God is evident when conflict and violence end, and it is characterized by peace (*Rom 14:17*). People will cooperate willingly or they will be forced to end their hostilities (*Ps 46:9*). The nations will submit to divine arbitration rather than go to war (see *Isa 1:18-20*). • The words **mediate** and **settle** refer to God’s acts here, but later verses show the Messiah as the executor of justice (*11:3-4*). When this takes place, **war** will cease, and the **nations** will change their instruments of war into agricultural tools. • **swords into plowshares:** Cp. *Joel 3:10*, where the nations are exhorted to hammer their plowshares into swords.\n\n
2:5	idm81749					 Isaiah condemned Israel’s and Judah’s arrogance and self-exaltation, warning them that only God was to be exalted. All attempts by humans to lift themselves up will actually result in humiliation.\n\n
2:5	idm81755					 The prophet threatened judgment and scoffed at human pride. All human structures (religious, economic, military, social) will come under divine scrutiny and be found deficient on the day of the Lord—that final day in history when God will judge the wicked once and for all (*1 Cor 1:8*; *1 Thes 5:2*; *2 Thes 2:2*; *2 Pet 3:10*; *Rev 20:7-15*). At times, the prophets also used the expression “the day of the Lord” (or others like it, such as “that day”) to refer to special instances of God’s judgment upon wickedness during the course of history (see *Isa 13:6*, *9*; *Ezek 13:5*; *30:3*; *Obad 1:15*). On the day of the Lord, God alone will be exalted, while all human wickedness and pride will be struck down. The glorious day of God’s coming will fill wicked and arrogant humans with terror (*Isa 2:10*, *19*, *21*).\n\n
2:5	idm81775					 **Come . . . let us walk:** Walking in God’s **light** (his revelation) will lead to glorious participation in his kingdom (see *60:1*; *1 Jn 1:7*). God is the only light that overcomes the darkness of sin and evil (*Isa 9:2*). People cannot generate such light in and of themselves (*59:9*) but must walk in the light God provides, as they trust him and live in obedience to his will (*50:10*). • The phrase **descendants of Jacob** alludes to Israel’s special historic relationship with the Lord as well as their history of sinfulness and rebellion (see *14:1*; *48:1*).\n\n
2:6	idm81791					 The Lord had **rejected his people** to discipline them (*8:17*). While not permanent, the rejection seriously threatened their expectations of a glorious future. • **sorcerers:** These practitioners of pagan religion were expressly banned from Israel (*Deut 18:10-11*). • The **Philistines** were Israel’s ancient enemies (*Isa 9:12*; *11:14*; *14:29*, *31*).\n\n
2:7	idm81806					 Isaiah pointed out all the things that people substitute for the true God: material achievements and securities (**silver . . . treasures**), military strength (**warhorses . . . chariots**), and objects of affection (**idols**). Such wealth and military strength characterized the reign of King Uzziah (*2 Chr 26:6-21*). Elsewhere, Isaiah pointed out the sheer folly of worshiping anything that is **made with** one’s **own hands** (see *Isa 44:9-20*; *45:16*).\n\n
2:10	idm81820					 In the day of God’s judgment, people will seek refuge in **caves in the rocks***,* natural hiding places in the rocky land of Judah, rather than repent in humility before almighty God. Kings and leaders as well as slaves and free persons will seek protection from judgment (see also *Rev 6:15*). • The **terror of** **the** Lord refers to God’s unbridled wrath against wickedness that will be revealed on the day of the Lord’s judgment. The prophecy shifts from Israel (*Isa 2:5-6*) to humanity at large. The Lord is against anything and anyone that exalts and trusts in human structures and beliefs rather than in him (*2:11-12*, *22*).\n\n
2:11	idm81835					 A key theme in Isaiah is that the Lord will be **exalted** and humble people will be restored (*57:15*), while **proud and mighty** people are **humbled** (*26:5*). • The **day of judgment** and the “day of reckoning” are also called the “day of the Lord.” There are seven such references in chs *2–4* (*2:11*, *17*, *20*; *3:6*, *18*; *4:1*, *2*).\n\n
2:13	idm81856					 The prophet used several images of human strength to elaborate on *2:11-12*.\n\n
2:13	idm81863					 The **cedars of Lebanon** were prized trees used in the construction of Solomon’s Temple and palace (*1 Kgs 5:6*) and other important buildings (*Ezra 3:7*). They represented wealth and power (*2 Chr 25:18*; *Pss 92:12*; *104:16*), yet these mighty trees were as nothing before the Lord (*Isa 10:34*; *33:9*; see the boast of Sennacherib in *37:24*). • The **oaks of** **Bashan** were also an image of strength and splendor (*Ezek 27:6*); they, too, will disappoint (*Isa 33:9*; *Nah 1:4*; *Zech 11:2*).\n\n
2:16	idm81884					 **every magnificent vessel:** Ornate sea-going vessels were a sign of prosperity.\n\n
2:17	idm81891					 The **day of judgment** is the “day of the Lord” (see *13:4-13*).\n\n
2:20	idm81900					 Animals such as **rodents and bats** lead a shadowy, subterranean existence. Those who worship idols will become like them in attempting to escape the Lord’s judgment.\n\n
2:22	idm81907					 The judgment prophecy of *2:6-21* is set between two related exhortations: to trust the Lord (*2:5*) and not to put trust in human beings (*2:22*). • Human strength is temporary, **frail as breath** (see *Ps 90*).\n\n
3:1	idm81918					 These verses continue the subject of judgment against Israel’s leadership (see *1:23-25*). The removal of leadership at all levels would allow the mob to gain control. Chaos and famine would turn Judah and Jerusalem into a social wasteland.\n\n
3:1	idm81925					 **take away . . . bread . . . water:** God had long ago warned of famine, with its horrible conditions that sometimes led to desperate acts, as one possible judgment for wickedness (*Lev 26:26-29*).\n\n
3:2	idm81933					 Regardless of their status, all military, civil, judicial, and religious leaders would be removed in the day of judgment (*39:7*; *2 Kgs 24:14-16*). God would eventually give his people good leaders again (*Isa 1:26*) but not diviners and others who used pagan forms of revelation (*47:9*, *12-13*; see *Deut 18:10-12*).\n\n
3:4	idm81945					 Conditions would be so severe that **boys** and **toddlers** would qualify as candidates for office. By this, Isaiah either meant that adult leaders would be so decimated that only children would be left alive to assume the role or simply that the new leaders would be as immature, unwise, strong willed, and inexperienced as children.\n\n
3:6	idm81953					 Things would be so bad (a **heap of ruins**) that no one would want to take leadership. The people would become so desperate that anyone providing **food or clothes** (*3:7*) could be the leader of the people. In fact, however, no one would have food or clothing (see *4:1*).\n\n
3:8	idm81963					 The failure of human strength and societal organization can be a form of divine judgment. • **to his face:** The people of Judah had become bold in their wickedness **like the people of Sodom** (*3:9*; see also *1:9-10*).\n\n
3:9	idm81973					 **The very look on their faces:** At this time people boldly displayed their rebellion against God.\n\n
3:10	idm81980					  The **godly**—the righteous remnant—will receive God’s rewards (see *40:10*).\n\n
3:11	idm81988					 The **wicked** who practice and execute injustice will receive God’s just punishment.\n\n
3:13	idm81995					 The Lord is both the prosecutor and the supreme judge in this trial against his people.\n\n
3:14	idm82001					 **elders and rulers:** Wickedness and abuse by ungodly and incompetent leadership thwarts God’s purpose for his people (see also *3:12*). Therefore, leaders come under more severe judgment because they bear responsibility for the welfare of those under them. • **my vineyard:** See the Song of the Vineyard (*5:1-7*).\n\n
3:15	idm82011					 The Lord cares for **the poor.** These were the marginalized and oppressed (see *1:17*), but God is their protector (see *25:4*). God called for his people to share his concern for the poor, but the Israelites were exploiting them to gain wealth (see *3:14*).\n\n
3:16	idm82021					 This passage applies the prophet’s teaching on arrogance (see *2:11-12*) to the people of Jerusalem. An alternate understanding is that this passage applies specifically to the women of Jerusalem.\n\n
3:16	idm82028					 The dramatic descriptions show how the people of Jerusalem loved their refined way of life. They openly displayed their proud self-reliance, power, and prestige. • **Beautiful Zion:** See “*Zion*” Theme Note.\n\n
3:17	idm82036					 In a reversal of fortune, the affluent and proud people of Jerusalem would suffer disgrace. Some of their **ornaments** (*3:18*) likely were amulets to keep evil away, but they could not ward off the calamity of judgment. These items of beauty were status symbols and represented financial security.\n\n
3:25	idm82044					 **The men . . . will die in battle:** Part of the city’s hopeless destitution would be the deaths of the men.\n\n
4:1	idm82051					 During Isaiah’s ministry, Jerusalem’s population was so decimated through war, famine, and disease (*3:1-3*; *6:13*; *14:30*; *22:2*; *37:4*) that there were **few men** left, creating an absence of leadership (see *3:1-12*). Even worse conditions lay ahead with the approaching war between Judah and the alliance of Syria and Israel in 734–732 BC (*2 Chr 28*) and eventually the conquest and fall of Jerusalem (605–586 BC).\n\n
4:2	idm82067					 In bold contrast to the desperate picture of *3:16–4:1*, this prophecy of salvation and hope (see also *2:2-4*) promised cleansing, consecration, and the renewal of God’s presence with the remnant. The imagery in *4:5-6* alludes to Israel’s exodus from Egypt, when a pillar of cloud and of fire guided and protected them. Israel’s restoration from exile would be a second exodus.\n\n
4:2	idm82076					 **The branch** in this context probably refers to the remnant that would constitute Israel’s new beginning after the Exile (see *6:13*). Some also understand it as representing the ideal descendant of David, the Messiah (see *11:1*; *Jer 23:5*; *33:15-16*; *Zech 3:8*; *6:12*). • A **beautiful and glorious** transformation from shame and disgrace (*Isa 3:17-25*) to fertility and beauty would manifest God’s presence and blessing among the remnant (*4:6*). • **The fruit of the land***,* nature itself, would also be transformed from desolation to glory. Elsewhere, Isaiah described the future circumstances as resembling the Garden of Eden (see *51:3*; *65:22*). The message of renewal finds its ultimate fulfillment in the new creation (see *Rom 8:19-27*; *2 Cor 5:17*; *Gal 6:15*; *Eph 2:15*; *4:24*; *Rev 21:22-27*). • Those **who survive in Israel**—the remnant—would be the true citizens of Zion.\n\n
4:3	idm82103					 To be **holy** was the requirement for citizenship in **Zion***,* where God dwells in his glorious majesty (see *6:3*; *Heb 12:14*). • The remnant would have their names **recorded among the living** in the Book of Life (*Exod 32:32*; *Dan 12:1*; *Mal 3:16*; *Rev 3:5*; *20:12*).\n\n
4:4	idm82120					 God’s **judgment** has a purifying effect on his covenant people (see *Mal 3:3*). Justice must be satisfied before restoration can be offered.\n\n
4:5	idm82128					 The references to a **canopy of cloud . . . and smoke and flaming fire** recall God’s continuous presence and protection during the exodus from Egypt (*Exod 13:21-22*; *14:21-22*).\n\n
4:6	idm82137					 **shelter** (literally *shadow;* see *32:2*): See *32:2*; God’s protection would keep the remnant safe from enemies and from the destruction he would bring on the wicked (*33:14-16*).\n\n
5:1	idm82148					 The prophet pronounced judgment through song (*5:1-7*) and prophecies of woe (*5:8-30*). Although Israel’s future condition would be one of purity and fellowship with God (*4:2-6*), that future cannot ignore the present sinful condition of the people and their leaders.\n\n
5:1	idm82157					 The Song of the Vineyard expresses in poetic form God’s indictment of the wicked leadership that had ruined his vineyard, Israel. Like some wisdom literature, it presents readers with an account of a puzzling situation (*5:1-2*) before giving its spiritual significance (*5:3-7*). The theme of the vineyard’s transformation is found again in ch *27* and in Jesus’ teaching (*Matt 21:33*; *Mark 12:1*).\n\n
5:1	idm82168					 The **one I love** refers to the Lord; the prophet was singing this song on the Lord’s behalf. • At first, the song sounds like a love song, but by *5:3* readers realize it is actually a complaint. • On Israel as God’s **vineyard,** see also *3:14*; *Matt 21:33-46*; *John 15:1-17*.\n\n
5:2	idm82180					 The Lord gave the best care to his vineyard, preparing and nursing it as an expert agriculturalist. He watched over it with great attentiveness, planting the **best vines**—ones that had the potential for abundant **sweet grapes**. God had great expectations of Israel as his people (see *Exod 19:5-6*), so the **bitter** grapes they produced—their unrighteous deeds—were useless and disappointing (cp. *Gal 5:22-23*).\n\n
5:3	idm82191					 Clearly, the Lord had graciously done everything possible for the vineyard. He was not to blame for the bitter grapes. • **you judge:** Isaiah wanted the audience to condemn the vineyard before he revealed that in fact they were the vineyard (*5:7*). This rhetorical tactic is similar to the one Nathan used to confront David (*2 Sam 12:1-5*).\n\n
5:5	idm82200					 The Lord promised to make his **vineyard***,* Israel, a desolate place because it was fit only for destruction. Later, Isaiah prophesied the gracious, glorious transformation of Israel from desolation to fruitful vitality (see *55:13*).\n\n
5:6	idm82209					  The withholding of **rain** was at times a divine judgment (*Deut 28:23-24*; *Hag 1:11*; *2:16*). It was especially devastating to a society that depended heavily on agriculture.\n\n
5:7	idm82219					 The identification of **Israel** as **the vineyard** is a surprise that resolves the riddle of this passage. • Here, a powerful play on Hebrew words indicted Israel. The Lord expected **justice** (Hebrew *mishpat*) but saw only **oppression** (*mispakh*) of the needy. Instead of **righteousness** (*tsedaqah*), there were **cries of violence** (*tse‘aqah*) against the poor (see *1:21-23*).\n\n
5:8	idm82236					 This section contains six pronouncements of **sorrow**—six threats of dreadful judgment (*5:8*, *11*, *18*, *20*, *21*, *22*). The sorrows identify some of the “bitter grapes” produced by the vineyard of Israel (*5:1-7*).\n\n
5:8	idm82250					 **What sorrow:** The first threat of judgment was against oppressive greed. Properties (**house and field**) were being taken by illegal means. The new owners were thugs who used every avenue to enrich themselves at the expense of the poor (see *1 Kgs 21:1-29*; *Amos 2:6-7*).\n\n
5:10	idm82260					 As with drought (*5:5-6*), the reduction of crops was at times a divine judgment (see *Hag 1:6*, *9*; *2:16*).\n\n
5:11	idm82270					 **What sorrow:** The second threat of judgment concerned indulgent lifestyles. The language throughout this section indicates a life of corruption.\n\n
5:12	idm82277					 Self-indulgent and contented, these people **never think about the** Lord. They were too busy enjoying their drunken parties to reflect on why things went bad in the first place, such as why God sent no rain, or why they lost a battle.\n\n
5:13	idm82285					 Israel and Judah would **go into exile** to Assyria (722 BC) and Babylon (586 BC). • The people did not respond to the Lord because they did not **know** him (see *1:3*). They likely knew about him, but their behavior showed that they did not know him in any intimate way.\n\n
5:14	idm82296					 The **grave** (Hebrew *Sheol*) represented the place of the dead in ancient Near Eastern thinking (see *14:9*).\n\n
5:16	idm82305					 God’s kingship is by definition just and righteous, and he will be **exalted by his justice**. At his exaltation, oppressors will be condemned (see *1:21-23*).\n\n
5:18	idm82313					 **What sorrow:** The third threat of judgment was against mockers, who openly treated God’s authority with contempt.\n\n
5:18	idm82320					 God’s **ropes** were “ropes of kindness and love” for Israel (*Hos 11:4*).\n\n
5:19	idm82328					 The people challenged God to **hurry up and do something** to prove that he really exists and is in control of this world. The verb *hurry up* translates two Hebrew verbs: *maher* (“be quick”) and *khush* (“be speedy”). The same Hebrew words are used in the name *Maher*-*shalal*-*hash*-*baz* (*Isa 8:1*). • God’s **plan** was revealed to Isaiah. Little did the people know that God’s purposes would turn against them.\n\n
5:20	idm82344					 **What sorrow:** The fourth threat of judgment was against a lack of integrity. • **evil is good . . . dark is light . . . bitter is sweet:** This twisted way of looking at life corrupts God’s holy order.\n\n
5:21	idm82352					 **What sorrow:** The fifth threat of judgment concerned the folly of self-deception.\n\n
5:22	idm82359					 **What sorrow:** The sixth threat of judgment was against the indulgent lifestyle of the wicked.\n\n
5:24	idm82366					 The image of rotting **roots** reflects human transience (cp. *11:1*; *27:6*; *37:31*). • To despise the Lord’s **word** means to ignore it, to live without regard for keeping it. Such an attitude toward God’s revelation leads to folly and ruin (*Prov 1:30*; *5:12*; *15:5*).\n\n
5:25	idm82380					 **mountains tremble:** God’s wrath against sinners is often expressed as the shaking of the earth’s foundations (*13:13*; *23:11*; *24:18-19*; *29:6*; *54:10*). God’s appearance in judgment or salvation in natural phenomena such as smoke, darkness, lightning, and earthquake is called a theophany (see *6:1-4*, *6*; *13:13*; *Exod 19:18-19*; *Ps 18:7-15*; *Mic 1:3-4*; *Rev 8:5*; *16:17-18*; *18:21-22*).\n\n
5:26	idm82401					 The **signal** was a banner raised on a long pole and often placed on a high hill (see also *13:2*; *18:3*; *30:17*). The expression **signal to distant nations** is common in Isaiah and might be a call for participation in battle (as here) or in salvation (*11:10*, *12*; *49:22*; *62:10*). • **Distant nations** refers to the Assyrians and Babylonians, who served as instruments of God’s judgment on Israel (722 BC) and on Judah (586 BC). They were the wild “animals” (*5:5*) called in to trample the vineyard (*5:1-7*). They would fiercely attack Israel and Judah, not letting up until God’s judgment was complete (*5:27-30*).\n\n
5:30	idm82422					 **day of destruction** (literally *that day;* see *study note on 2:5-22*). • In Old Testament prophecy, **darkness** represents the experience of God’s alienation, wrath, and judgment (see also *8:22*), while light stands for his holy presence (see especially *60:2*, *19*).\n\n
6:1	idm82435					 Isaiah’s marvelous vision of God as King on his throne served as a pivotal event in the life of the prophet. The historical circumstances surrounding this event can be interpreted in two ways: (1) Some see ch *6* as Isaiah’s original call to ministry, meaning that chs *1–5* and *7–12* fit into the reign of Ahaz, who came to rule after the death of Uzziah (*6:1*). If this were so, why was Isaiah’s call not at the beginning of the book? Perhaps his call was put in ch *6* for literary reasons, serving as a conclusion to chs *1–5* and an introduction to chs *7–12*. The prophet’s own transformation and commissioning symbolizes the entire nation’s need for conversion if it wants to fulfill its mandate to be God’s light to the world. (2) Others understand chs *1–12* as chronological; Isaiah’s call in ch *6* would then serve as a recommissioning of the prophet to minister in a new way in a different period (the time of Ahaz) when his words would be rejected. Those who hold this interpretation point to *2:7-9*; *3:16-24*; *and 5:8-14*, contending that these passages reflect a time of prosperity, military strength, pride, and splendor; these conditions existed during Uzziah’s reign but not during Ahaz’s reign.\n\n
6:1	idm82453					 At the time of **King Uzziah**’s death, the Assyrians had begun to reassert their dominance in the ancient Near East. It marked the beginning of an era dominated by major world powers—Assyria, then Babylonia, Persia, Greece, and Rome. • **I saw the Lord:** “Lord” (Hebrew *’adonay*) is used to describe human rulers as well as God. God is the supreme King. • **on a lofty throne:** The apostle John also had a vision of God’s heavenly throne (see *Rev 4:2*; *7:10*; *21:5*). • If just the **train** of the Lord’s **robe filled the Temple,** how great and majestic must have been the robe itself and the one wearing it.\n\n
6:2	idm82468					 The **mighty seraphim** are heavenly beings not mentioned elsewhere in Scripture (but see also *Rev 4:6-9*; *15:8*). The Hebrew term might suggest an association with fire. They **covered their faces** so as not to look on God.\n\n
6:3	idm82478					 The triple usage of the word **holy** emphasizes the absolute separateness of the Lord. • **The whole earth is filled:** Because there is no verb in the Hebrew, two slightly different translations of the seraphim’s proclamation are possible. It could be that the **earth***,* though defiled, is currently **filled with his glory** in creation. Or, it could mean that the earth *will* be filled with the glory of the Lord when he establishes his kingship on the earth in the future. Either way, the Lord’s glorious presence will one day dwell more fully on earth, despite humanity’s sinfulness and the power of wicked nations. God’s glory was further revealed in the incarnation of the Son (*John 12:41*; *2 Cor 3:18*; *4:4-7*).\n\n
6:5	idm82493					 **It’s all over! I am doomed:** The prophet felt unworthy of the vision. He was painfully aware of his personal uncleanness (**sinful . . . filthy lips**) when compared to the holiness of God. Isaiah knew that he was unworthy to speak the pure word of God, as were his people.\n\n
6:7	idm82501					 **your guilt is removed, and your sins are forgiven:** The prophet’s experience of forgiveness anticipated Israel’s national need for forgiveness and cleansing (*43:25*; *44:22*; see *study note on 39:6-7*).\n\n
6:8	idm82511					 **Who will go for us?** The Lord spoke in the presence of his angels, the heavenly council (see also *1 Kgs 22:19-22*; *Jer 23:18*, *22*). • **Here I am:** The prophet was so overcome by the grace of God in cleansing him that he willingly committed himself to a lifetime of ministry.\n\n
6:9	idm82522					 **do not understand . . . learn nothing:** The prophet’s words brought out the heart response of his audience. The people were so sunk in sin that when they heard the truth it did not bring them closer to God but actually drove them away (e.g., Ahaz, ch *7*). Yet the truth had to be declared. Jesus also applied this principle in his own preaching (*Matt 13:14-15*; *Luke 8:10*; *19:42*; *John 12:40*; see also *Acts 28:26-27*; *Rom 11:8*).\n\n
6:10	idm82536					 Isaiah was God’s agent to stimulate blindness and deafness in the wicked and sight and hearing in the godly (see also *29:9-10*, *18*; *35:5*; *42:7*, *16-19*; *43:8*; *56:10*; *59:10*). • **turn to me for healing:** The Lord was ready to heal those who truly repented, but not those who merely wanted to avoid judgment while holding on to their sinful ways.\n\n
6:11	idm82551					 **how long . . . until . . . the whole country is a wasteland:** During the prophet’s ministry (740 to 685 BC), the nation was plagued by wars, famines, and other forms of devastation.\n\n
6:13	idm82559					 Even if **a tenth—a remnant—survive***,* the judgment would continue until nearly all were destroyed. The prophet often spoke of near extermination or decimation (*9:18-21*; *10:20*; *22:4*; *48:19*; *51:18*) but maintained the hope of a remnant who would make a new beginning (*7:21-22*; *29:23*; *37:31*; *44:26*; *49:19*; *54:1*). • **Israel’s stump will be a holy seed:** The stump represents a remnant of holy people (see *4:2-3*) whose new leader would be pleasing to the Lord (*11:1*).\n\n
7:3	idm82581					 In this long section of the book, the nation of Israel was confronted with a vision of God, similar to how Isaiah was confronted in ch *6*.\n\n
7:1	idm82588					 The historical context of these prophecies involved Assyria’s rise to power and the alliance between Syria and Israel as enemies of Judah (*7:1-2*; see *2 Kgs 16:5*). Assyria became God’s rod to punish Syria, Israel, and Judah (Isa  *7–10*).\n\n
7:1	idm82597					 At one point in his reign, Ahaz found himself in a crisis. The leaders of Syria and Israel attacked Judah. They planned to replace Ahaz and force Judah to join them in their resistance against Assyria. Ahaz responded by calling Assyria in to help him (*2 Kgs 16:7-10*), thus refusing Isaiah’s challenge to trust the Lord instead (*Isa 7:12*). Although the Assyrians squelched the alliance of Syria and Israel, leading to the eventual downfall of both those nations, they also soon set their sights on total domination of Judah.\n\n
7:1	idm82605					 **Rezin** was king of **Syria**. Damascus was Syria’s capital city. • **Pekah** was king of Israel 740–732 BC. He was a renowned warrior (*2 Chr 28:5-8*). • Pekah and Rezin began to **attack Jerusalem** while Jotham was king (750–732 BC), and they intensified their efforts during the early years of young King Ahaz (*2 Kgs 15:37*; *16:5*).\n\n
7:2	idm82620					 **hearts . . . trembled with fear:** In contrast, Ahaz’s son King Hezekiah faced the Assyrians some thirty years later with great faith (701 BC; see *37:6-7*, *14-20*).\n\n
7:3	idm82630					 The **aqueduct** was a place where political negotiations took place later during Hezekiah’s reign (see *36:2*).\n\n
7:4	idm82638					 **he doesn’t need to fear:** This was a “fear not” prophecy (common in Isaiah) in which the Lord assured his people of his presence and purpose. • **two burned-out embers:** If Ahaz had God’s perspective, he would have seen that Rezin and Pekah were minor threats who were about to be extinguished.\n\n
7:6	idm82646					 The **son of Tabeel***,* otherwise unknown, was obviously sympathetic to Israel’s and Syria’s resistance against Assyria.\n\n
7:8	idm82654					 The Assyrian kings Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal had Israel resettled with people from other places **within sixty-five years** (by 670 BC; see *2 Kgs 17:24-34*). • Damascus was **crushed and completely destroyed** by 732 BC, and Samaria was crushed by 722 BC.\n\n
7:9	idm82666					 The last sentence is a play on two Hebrew words: If you do not have faith (*ta’aminu*), you will not stand firm (*te’amenu*). Firm trust in the Lord is utterly essential, especially for a leader of God’s people (see also *2 Chr 20:20*), and it must be firmly acted upon in order to demonstrate that it exists. Ahaz and his contemporaries trusted their enemy (Assyria) rather than God. By contrast, Hezekiah later demonstrated his faith in the Lord in a similar context (see *Isa 36–38*).\n\n
7:11	idm82676					 A **sign of confirmation** would be performed before Ahaz’s eyes as a token of God’s truthfulness. His son Hezekiah would also receive such a sign (see *37:30*).\n\n
7:12	idm82684					 **I will not test the** Lord** like that:** Despite this seemingly pious response (based on *Deut 6:16*), Ahaz was most likely already in negotiations with the Assyrians and had already decided whom he would trust for rescue in this war.\n\n
7:14	idm82694					 This prophecy received its ultimate fulfillment in the birth of Jesus Christ (*Matt 1:18-24*). Yet it is likely that it also had a partial fulfillment in Isaiah’s day, either with the birth of godly king Hezekiah, Ahaz’s son, or with the birth of one of Isaiah’s children. The similar sequence of the verbs in *Isa 7:14* and *8:3* (**conceive . . . give birth . . . call**) and the link between Immanuel and Maher-shalal-hash-baz in *8:5-10* suggest that Immanuel and Maher-shalal-hash-baz were the same person. • The name **Immanuel (which means ‘God is with us’)** symbolized God’s presence and protection. God was with Judah during the attack by the alliance of Syria and Israel (734 BC), in the Assyrian crisis (701 BC), and throughout their prolonged existence until their fall in 586 BC. The kingdom of Israel fell during the time of Isaiah (722 BC). The assurance “I am with you” remained significant even in the exilic and postexilic periods (*41:10*; *43:2*, *5*). The greatest assurance ultimately came in Jesus Christ, the incarnate Son of God (*Matt 1:23*; see also *Rev 12:5*).\n\n
7:15	idm82715					 **By the time this child is old enough:** The crisis involving the alliance of Syria and Israel against Judah was in 734 BC; by 732 BC Damascus, capital of Syria, was destroyed, and the northern kingdom, Israel, was defeated. • **choose what is right and reject what is wrong:** This was to happen by the age of 12, when a child was held responsible as an adult. In 722 BC, Israel went into exile. • **he will be eating yogurt and honey:** The land would be so depopulated that these delicacies would be available to all.\n\n
7:17	idm82727					 **Israel broke away from Judah** in 931 BC (see *1 Kgs 12:19-20*). • **will bring the king of Assyria upon you:** Ahaz called Assyria in to help (*2 Kgs 16:8-9*), but Assyria turned against him and made Judah a vassal state.\n\n
7:18	idm82738					 The repetition of **in that day** referred to the yet future day of the Lord. Judah would experience the judgment already announced by Isaiah as a foretaste of an even greater judgment to come: exile in Babylon (586–538 BC).\n\n
7:19	idm82746					 Locations such as **desolate valleys, caves, and thorny places** were places of refuge for the desperate (see *2:10*). However, Judah’s enemies would find them there.\n\n
7:20	idm82754					 **shave off everything: your land, your crops, and your people:** In the ancient Near East, forced shaving was an act of disgrace (see *2 Sam 10:4-5*). Here it was a metaphor for the despoiling of the country.\n\n
7:23	idm82762					 Farmers faced near total disaster. Fertile agricultural fields (**lush vineyards**) would revert to wild grazing lands dominated by worthless plants (**briers and thorns;** see *5:6*).\n\n
8:1	idm82771					 The meaning of the name **Maher-shalal-hash-baz** (“Swift to plunder and quick to carry away”) applies both to Judah’s enemies (*8:4*) and to Judah itself (*8:7-8*). They had trusted Assyria in place of God, and now Assyria would turn on them and all but destroy them. God was with them (*Immanuel;* see *7:14*), but his presence would be destructive if they refused to trust in him (see *8:14*).\n\n
8:3	idm82783					 **my wife:** Literally *the prophetess.* • Like the name *Immanuel* (*7:14*), **Maher-shalal-hash-baz** is symbolic. It is possible that this child was the partial fulfillment of the Immanuel prophecy as well (see *study note on 7:14*). The ultimate fulfillment of the Immanuel prophecy occurred with the birth of Jesus (*Matt 1:22-23*).\n\n
8:4	idm82796					 **before this child is old enough:** See also *7:16*. • **Damascus** and **Samaria** were ruined and destroyed in 732 BC, fulfilling this verse along with *7:8*, *19-20*.\n\n
8:5	idm82809					 This prophecy connects the sign of Maher-shalal-hash-baz with the sign of Immanuel (*8:8*, *10*).\n\n
8:6	idm82817					 **The gently flowing waters of Shiloah** supplied Jerusalem with water. Here they represent God’s loving presence and provision (see *Ps 46:4*). • Ahaz **rejected** the sign and the promise of God’s protection. He was not a man of faith (*Isa 7:9*), and now **the people** were following in his footsteps by placing their hope in Assyria to save them from **King Rezin and King Pekah** (cp. *7:7-9*, *16*).\n\n
8:7	idm82831					 The **mighty flood from the Euphrates River** represents the invading Assyrian army (see *Jer 47:2*). The river would **overflow all its channels** when the Assyrians marched deep into Judah. This stood as a frightening contrast with the gently flowing waters of Shiloah (*Isa 8:6*).\n\n
8:8	idm82841					 **chin deep:** Judah barely survived the Assyrian assaults in 701 BC (see chs *36–37*). • **submerging your land from one end to the other:** From north to south, Judah was nearly devastated, except for the city of Jerusalem (see *1:8-9*; chs *36–37*). • **Immanuel:** Despite their failure to trust him and the disaster it brought, God was still with his people (see *7:14*).\n\n
8:9	idm82855					 God’s plan to rescue his stubborn people would ultimately be fulfilled. God planned to destroy Assyria, just as he does every other proud nation that rejects him or boasts in its own power.\n\n
8:10	idm82861					 **God is with us:** See *7:14*; *8:8*.\n\n
8:11	idm82870					 This text reveals the heart of Isaiah’s message. The issue was fear of the Lord versus fear of people (see *7:9*; *8:6*). When an individual fears people, the Lord becomes a trap and destruction is certain (cp. *Prov 29:25*; see “*Fearing People*” Theme Note). For those who fear the Lord, he becomes a sanctuary; their salvation is assured.\n\n
8:12	idm82880					 People regarded Isaiah’s message of non-involvement with Assyria as treasonous, part of a **conspiracy**. But Isaiah was not trying to play political games; rather, he proclaimed God’s message. • **What frightens them** was the alliance of Syria and Israel attacking Judah (see *7:1*, *4*).\n\n
8:13	idm82890					 To **make the** Lord** . . . holy** meant giving him first place in life and acknowledging that nothing is greater than he is. • **Fear** of God means reverencing him as God (*Prov 1:7*). The people of Judah were not to fear Israel and Syria or the Assyrians (*Isa 7:9*; *10:24*).\n\n
8:14	idm82903					 **He will keep you safe** (literally *he will be a sanctuary*): God is a place of refuge. • **stone . . . stumble . . . rock . . . fall:** By trusting Assyria rather than God, the people of **Jerusalem** would find themselves in **a trap and a snare** as the Assyrians turned against them. For those who trust in the Lord, however, he is faithful and strong (*28:16*; see *Ps 118:22-23*; *Luke 2:34*; *Rom 9:32-33*; *1 Pet 2:6-8*).\n\n
8:16	idm82919					 The command to preserve Isaiah’s teaching suggests that it was harshly received by his contemporaries, who might have wanted to snuff it out. Faithful disciples safely preserved the prophet’s messages.\n\n
8:16	idm82925					 **instructions** (Hebrew *torah*): The Torah defined Israel’s covenant relationship with God, but the people were quick to forget (see also *1:10*).\n\n
8:17	idm82934					 **I will wait for the** Lord** . . . I will put my hope in him:** Isaiah’s message against Syria, Israel, and Assyria would be proven true in the historical events that followed. The fulfillment would further encourage the godly to await the final downfall of all ungodly power structures (see *8:9-10*). Waiting for the Lord requires submission, prayer, hope, and faith (see *25:9*; *26:8*; *33:2*), resulting in a quiet spirit and a renewal of inner strength (*40:31*). The book of Hebrews applies these words to Jesus Christ (*Heb 2:13*). • God had **turned away***;* the people of Israel and Judah were alienated from the Lord because of their sin.\n\n
8:18	idm82951					 **I and the children the** Lord** has given me** (see the application to Jesus Christ in *Heb 2:13*): The names of the prophet Isaiah and his children carried significance as **signs and warnings**. Shear-jashub (*a remnant will return;* *7:3*) was a sign of God’s faithfulness to Judah. Maher-shalal-hash-baz (*swift to plunder and quick to carry away*) signified the destruction of Damascus and Samaria (*8:1-4*) and the desolation of faithless Judah (*8:5-8*). The name of Isaiah (*Yahweh is salvation*) itself signifies that salvation is from the Lord alone. These three names also represent major themes in the book: the remnant, the desolation of Judah, and salvation. Immanuel (*God is with us*) embodies all of these themes, along with the idea that Judah would be protected if only it would trust in the Lord.\n\n
8:19	idm82969					 Isaiah contrasts his counsel with that of his ungodly contemporaries. Isaiah’s message gives light, whereas the message of the spiritists led to darkness and death. • **Mediums** used various means of divination, including summoning the dead, in the attempt to determine the future (see *19:3*). God had banned these useless activities (*47:9*; *Deut 18:9-11*).\n\n
8:20	idm82979					 God gave **instructions and teachings** through the law and through his prophets, such as Isaiah (see *8:16*).\n\n
9:1	idm82987					 Beyond destruction there is hope. In the Messiah’s kingdom, the darkness would give way to great light, which was to dawn in Galilee and reach the whole nation, and then the whole world. The Messiah’s rule would be marked by the vindication of the oppressed and the end of all oppression. He would bring justice and righteousness forever in a kingdom of peace.\n\n
9:1	idm82993					 **Zebulun and Naphtali** were northern tribes in Israel (*Judg 6:35*). They were **humbled** by the Assyrian invaders under Tiglath-pileser III in 734 and 732 BC. In Jesus’ lifetime, this prophecy was connected with his coming out of Galilee (*Matt 4:14-16*). • **Galilee of the Gentiles** was the region of Israel between the Sea of Galilee and the Mediterranean Sea. It was heavily influenced—culturally, religiously, and politically—by the surrounding Gentile nations.\n\n
9:4	idm83005					 The people experienced the rule of other nations as a **yoke of . . . slavery** and a **heavy burden** (*Jer 30:8*). • **oppressor’s rod:** In *Isa 10:5*, the Assyrians are called “the rod of [the Lord’s] anger.” Just as God’s anger will cease, so will Assyria’s oppression of Judah (*14:5*). • The Lord had **destroyed the army of Midian** through Gideon (see *Judg 6:35*; *7:22-25*).\n\n
9:5	idm83020					 Burning the **boots** and **uniforms** marked the end of the need for instruments of war.\n\n
9:6	idm83028					 **a child is born to us, a son is given to us:** This child, the Messiah, would be David’s descendant (*11:1*). • **he will be called:** These names can be read as four throne names, signifying the nature of the child’s rule: (1) The **Wonderful Counselor** conforms to God’s wisdom (*11:1*; *25:1*; *28:29*; *40:13*), unlike the counselors of Judah (*1:26*; *3:3*). (2) **Mighty God** is an affirmation of the Messiah’s divine nature. (3) He cares for his children as the **Everlasting Father,** the father whose care continues forever (cp. *22:21*; *63:16*). (4) The **Prince of Peace** is a leader who brings peace. • Alternatively, the four names could be collapsed into two: (1) “A Wonderful Counselor [is] the Mighty God”; and (2) “the Everlasting Father [is] a Prince of Peace” (on his nature, see *11:1-9*). • Jesus Christ, the Son of David (*Matt 1:1*; *Luke 1:32*; see also *Isa 7:14*; *8:3*, *18*), will bring in the kingdom of his peace (*Rev 19*).\n\n
9:7	idm83056					 Like Ahaz, this ruler will be a descendant of **David**. Unlike Ahaz and the rulers of Jerusalem (*1:21-23*), he would trust God and rule with justice and righteousness (*11:1-3*). Jesus the Messiah reigns for all eternity (*Luke 1:32-33*).\n\n
9:8	idm83066					 This prophecy of judgment was against the northern kingdom of Israel. Despite God’s message that the Assyrians would crush them (chs *7–8*), the people of Samaria were foolishly confident that they could withstand the siege.\n\n
9:10	idm83073					 In their proud confidence, Israel thought it would replace whatever was lost with more expensive items (see *2:13-16*; *Amos 5:11*).\n\n
9:11	idm83081					 **Rezin’s enemies** were the Assyrians (*7:4*, *17*; *8:4*). Rezin was king of Syria (see ch *7*).\n\n
9:13	idm83092					 God’s punishment was intended to bring repentance, not destruction; but Israel was apostate and refused to **repent** or **seek** the Lord.\n\n
9:17	idm83100					  Even **widows and orphans,** ordinarily objects of God’s compassion (*1:17*, *23*; *10:2*), became objects of his wrath when they were unrepentant.\n\n
9:18	idm83110					 Following the decimation of leadership, civil war would destroy the nation like an out-of-control **brushfire**.\n\n
9:21	idm83117					 **Manasseh** and **Ephraim** represent the northern kingdom as its largest tribes. The two largest tribes of Israel and **Judah** fought amongst themselves. This is probably a reference to the war between Judah and the alliance of Syria and Israel, which is commonly called the Syro-Ephraimite War (*7:1-12*). In that conflict, brothers savagely fought against brothers (*2 Chr 28*).\n\n
10:1	idm83128					 This prophecy was directed against Judah’s leaders, who used their positions to enrich themselves at the people’s expense.\n\n
10:1	idm83134					 **What sorrow** introduces a threat of divine judgment.\n\n
10:3	idm83141					 The implied answer to Isaiah’s rhetorical questions was that there would be no one to turn to when God punished Judah. • **Disaster** came first **from** the **distant land** of Assyria and later from Babylon.\n\n
10:5	idm83150					 The primacy of the Lord’s moral law was established in *9:8–10:4*; this passage works out the implications of the law: (1) Assyria was only a tool in God’s hands and was therefore as liable to judgment by God as any other nation (*10:5-19*, *28-34*); (2) those among God’s people who trusted in him and obeyed his covenant would be rescued (*10:20-27*); and (3) God would establish his kingdom on earth (ch *11*).\n\n
10:5	idm83161					 This judgment was pronounced on Assyria because of their ruthless destruction of nations (*10:7*), blasphemous boasting (*10:12*), oppression (*10:13-14*), and self-perceived autonomy (*10:15*).\n\n
10:5	idm83171					 The Assyrians were God’s instrument (**rod . . . club**) in judging Syria, Israel, and Judah, but they would not go unpunished for their own wickedness.\n\n
10:6	idm83178					 Despite their privileged calling as God’s covenant people, Judah had become a **godless nation,** making them the object of God’s anger (*10:4*). • The word **plunder** translates both the Hebrew words *shalal* and *baz,* recalling the name *Maher-shalal-hash-baz* (see *5:19*; *8:1*, *3*, *5-10*).\n\n
10:7	idm83194					 **will not understand:** The Assyrians did not realize they were following God’s intended purpose to punish Israel and Judah. Because they went about savagely killing and looting other nations of their own accord, God would also hold them guilty.\n\n
10:9	idm83201					 **We destroyed: **By 717 BC, the regions to the north of Judah were firmly in Assyrian hands. **Calno***,* in northern Syria (referred to as *Calneh* in *Amos 6:2*), fell to the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III in 738 BC. **Carchemish,** on the Euphrates River, was taken by King Sargon II in 717 BC. **Hamath,** on the Orontes River, was subjugated in 738 and 720 BC. **Arpad** was located south of Calno. **Damascus** and **Samaria***,* the capitals of Syria and Israel, were taken in 732 and 722 BC, respectively (*Isa 7:8*; *8:4*).\n\n
10:10	idm83225					 **whose gods were greater than those in Jerusalem and Samaria:** Assyria would make this argument while threatening Jerusalem (*36:19-20*; *37:12*).\n\n
10:11	idm83234					 Assyria **destroyed Samaria** under Shalmaneser V and Sargon II in 722 BC (*2 Kgs 17:3-6*). If Samaria and Judah worshiped the same God, and Assyria had already defeated Samaria, the king of Assyria could expect to defeat Judah also.\n\n
10:12	idm83243					 Any royal power that exalts itself against the Lord, the Great King, is **proud and arrogant** (see *2:11-12*) and will be crushed.\n\n
10:13	idm83251					 **my own powerful arm . . . my own shrewd wisdom** (cp. *10:5*): God alone is all-powerful and wise. He plans the future, and he determines which nations will rise to power and which will be defeated.\n\n
10:15	idm83259					 **ax . . . saw . . . rod . . . wooden cane:** Such instruments are only as good as **the person who uses** them. Assyria considered itself independent of the **hand** of God, but their conquests were made possible only by his permission and to serve his purposes (*10:5*).\n\n
10:16	idm83269					 The fulfillment of this prophecy was in 701 BC, when 185,000 Assyrian troops were killed by **plague** and **flaming fire** (see *37:36*).\n\n
10:20	idm83279					 In the midst of Assyrian oppression, there was hope for the remnant. This passage develops more fully the meaning of Shear-jashub, **a remnant will return** (*10:21*; see *7:3*; *8:18*).\n\n
10:20	idm83289					 **left . . . the survivors:** A remnant from Jerusalem barely survived, but their safety was secure because God promised to preserve them (see *1:8-9*; *4:2*; *6:13*; *37:31-32*). • All these wars would teach the Israelite remnant to **no longer depend on allies** such as Assyria. Instead, they would **faithfully trust** in the Lord (see *8:13*; *17:7*).\n\n
10:22	idm83304					 God had similarly promised descendants **as numerous as the sand of the seashore** to Abraham (*Gen 22:17*). • **rightly decided to destroy:** God’s decision was a just response to the people’s persistent wickedness.\n\n
10:24	idm83313					 God assured his people of his presence and purpose.\n\n
10:24	idm83319					 **as the Egyptians did long ago:** See *Exod 1:8–2:25*.\n\n
10:26	idm83327					 **Gideon triumphed over the Midianites:** See *Judg 7:25*.\n\n
10:27	idm83335					 Israel’s **bondage** ended in 539 BC with a new exodus from exile.\n\n
10:28	idm83343					 **Look, the Assyrians are now at Aiath:** The march described in *10:29-32* is a poetic account of Assyria’s defeat. The places follow a route from the north down to Jerusalem. Upon arriving at Jerusalem, the Assyrians were forced to retreat. God was with Jerusalem, and eventually Assyria would be utterly destroyed. This passage might foretell Sennacherib’s invasion in 701 BC (see chs *36–37*), but it could just as well describe an earlier or later invasion.\n\n
11:1	idm83353					 The kingdom of the Messiah, first introduced in *9:1-7*, is now considered in more detail. Isaiah challenged the Israelites about why they would trust in any of the nations when God had far better plans in mind.\n\n
11:1	idm83360					 **stump . . . shoot . . . new Branch . . . from the old root:** This new growth refers to the continuity of David’s royal family line despite its virtual cessation during the Exile (see also *6:13*; *39:7*; *Rev 22:16*). The new growth from the old roots would not be like the former frail and unjust descendants of David (see *Isa 4:2*). Jesus, the Messiah, is the final fulfillment.\n\n
11:2	idm83371					 **The Spirit of the** Lord** will rest on** the Messiah. The succession of David’s line is guaranteed by the Spirit. The Messiah’s coming would bring justice and righteousness (*11:4*), peace (*11:8*), and the extension of the Kingdom to the nations (*11:10*; see also *32:15-16*). • The promised Messiah would have great **wisdom and understanding***,* like Solomon, as well as **knowledge and the fear of the** Lord (*1 Kgs 3:28*; *4:29*; *Prov 1:1-7*; *2:6-7*). • **The Spirit of counsel and might** alludes to *Isa 9:6*. The Messiah will be full of wisdom and will have the power to execute his righteous rule.\n\n
11:3	idm83394					 **obeying the** Lord**:** Literally *the fear of the* Lord*,* as in *11:2* (see *Prov 1:7*).\n\n
11:4	idm83408					 **The poor and . . . the exploited** would receive the justice due to them, which the wicked leaders of Judah had previously withheld. • **the force of his word:** Literally *the scepter of his mouth* (see *Ps 2:9*; *Rev 19:15*).\n\n
11:5	idm83419					 By virtue of the righteous character of the Messiah, his reign will be characterized by justice, **righteousness***,* and truth, in contrast to the conditions of Jerusalem described in *1:21*.\n\n
11:6	idm83428					 **In that day** means *in the coming age of the Messiah*. The prophecy that follows received partial fulfillment in Isaiah’s day or shortly thereafter. The final fulfillment is found in the coming of the Messiah to inaugurate and then fully establish the age to come.\n\n
11:9	idm83436					 **Nothing will hurt or destroy:** There will be no evildoers, corruption, or sin on God’s **holy mountain** (Zion).\n\n
11:10	idm83444					 **the heir to David’s throne:** Literally *the root of Jesse* (*11:1*; *Rev 5:5*; *22:16*). • The Messiah will bring **salvation to all the world** (*Isa 2:1-5*). Members of other **nations** will even serve as priests and Levites (*66:20-21*), but only if they repent and believe in the true God.\n\n
11:11	idm83459					 The first time **the Lord** reached out **his hand** was at the Exodus; the **second time** will occur in the future when the Messiah gathers Gentiles (*11:10*) and his own people who live among the Gentile nations (*11:11*). The Exodus remained the paradigm of hope for those in exile (see *11:16*; *35:8*; *40:3*; *43:19-20*; *48:21*). • The **remnant of his people** included Israelites who survived the Assyrian and Babylonian invasions and were sent into exile.\n\n
11:13	idm83476					 **jealousy between Israel and Judah:** The two kingdoms had become enemies during Judah’s war with the alliance of Syria and Israel (see *7:1-12*). In the future, they would cooperate in joint military expeditions.\n\n
11:14	idm83484					 **Philistia to the west:** The Philistines were Israel’s historic enemy. • **The nations to the east** included the Edomites, Moabites, and Ammonites. All foes would be vanquished.\n\n
11:15	idm83492					 Using imagery from Israel’s past exodus, Isaiah encouraged his listeners by promising that God would bring his people out of Assyria the way he brought them out of Egypt (*Exod 14:29–15:18*; see also *Rev 16:12*).\n\n
12:1	idm83500					 The prophet’s personal song of praise for God’s salvation closes the meditations on trust in chs *7–12*. God will prove himself trustworthy in his promises to rescue his people even though they initially refused to trust him. The song anticipates chs *40–66* with its themes of salvation, forgiveness, praise, joy, and the nations.\n\n
12:1	idm83508					 God’s **comfort** is the main subject of chs *40–66*.\n\n
12:2	idm83516					 God’s promise **to save** includes reconciliation (*1:18*), participation (*11:10*), cleansing and protection (*4:3-6*), peace and confidence (*32:16-17*), and restoration (*11:6-9*). • Lord God (Hebrew *Yah Yahweh*): The first word is an abbreviation of the second. • **The** Lord God** is my strength and my song:** See *Exod 15:2*; *Ps 118:14*.\n\n
12:3	idm83535					 God’s **salvation** is like a deep and unending source of water that provides life (see also *41:18*; *Ps 87:7*).\n\n
12:4	idm83544					 **Tell the nations what he has done:** The story of salvation must be told, even beyond the community of Israel (*Pss 67:2*; *70:4*; *98:2*).\n\n
12:6	idm83554					 See *Pss 48:1*; *96:4*; *99:2*.\n\n
13:1	idm83563					 This section contains prophecies of judgment against the nations. By including a prophecy against Judah and Jerusalem (*22:1-25*) in the midst of prophecies against the pagan nations, Isaiah emphasized that Israel’s identity as God’s people would not protect them from God’s punishment when they sinned as the other nations do.\n\n
13:1	idm83570					 At the time of this prophecy, Assyria was the major power. Isaiah anticipated the rise of Babylon as an even crueler kingdom that would destroy Judah and Jerusalem (*39:6-7*; chs *46–47*). The universal language of *13:1–14:23* suggests that in this context, Babylon represents all wicked and arrogant nations in the same way that “Babylon the Great” does in the book of Revelation (*Rev 18*). Therefore, while this description of Babylon’s fall applies to the fall of historic Babylon in 539 BC, it also applies until the final judgment against the ultimate kingdom of evil (*Rev 19*).\n\n
13:2	idm83582					 A **signal flag** or banner that could be seen clearly from a great distance was often placed **on a bare hilltop** as a call to battle. • God stands **against Babylon** as the symbolic representative of all evil kingdoms.\n\n
13:5	idm83591					 Just as Assyria was the rod of his anger (*9:4*; *10:5*, *15*), other nations serve as **the** Lord**’s weapons** and carry out his will. The Medes and Persians conquered Babylon in 539 BC. • God’s wrath is an expression of his justice as well as his intent to restore order to the world by obliterating evildoers (*10:25-26*; see *Lam 2:22*; *Ezek 7:19*).\n\n
13:6	idm83607					 When pronouncing judgment that is still in the future, the prophets sometimes spoke as though it had already **arrived.** This emphasized the urgency of turning back to God (*Ezek 30:3*; *Joel 1:15*; *3:14*; *Obad 1:15*; *Zeph 1:7*).\n\n
13:8	idm83619					 **Pangs . . . like those of a woman in labor:** The day of the Lord brings sudden and overpowering pain and fear for the wicked (see also *Jer 30:6*; *Hos 13:13*; *Mic 4:9*, *10*; *5:3*).\n\n
13:10	idm83631					 Cosmic upheaval and darkness are common images for the day of the Lord, a time of God’s judgment (see also *Ezek 32:7-8*; *Joel 2:10*, *31*; *3:15*; *Matt 24:29*; *Mark 13:24*; *Rev 6:12-13*; *8:12*; cp. *Isa 30:26*).\n\n
13:11	idm83646					 **punish the world:** See *Rev 20:11*.\n\n
13:12	idm83654					 Solomon’s imported **gold** came from **Ophir** (*1 Kgs 9:28*).\n\n
13:13	idm83663					 God **will shake the heavens. The earth will move:** Cosmic upheaval will accompany God’s coming in judgment (see *study note on 5:25*; see also *Hag 2:7*, *21*; *Heb 12:26-27*; *Rev 16:17-18*; *18:21-22*).\n\n
13:16	idm83676					 These terrible acts of war would be perpetrated against Babylon, itself a cruel conquering power (see also *Ps 137:8-9*; *Jer 6:11-12*; *Nah 3:10*).\n\n
13:17	idm83685					 The Lord is sovereign and controls history. He can **stir up** kingdoms to execute his will. • The **Medes** from northwestern Iran joined Persian King Cyrus in fighting **against Babylon** in 539 BC.\n\n
13:19	idm83695					 This picture of **Babylon** as a perpetually haunted ruin contrasts with its magnificence at its peak (see *Dan 4:29-30*).\n\n
13:20	idm83703					 **Babylon will never be inhabited again:** Babylon, often a symbol of idolatry, immorality, imperialism, and oppression in Scripture, will one day come completely to an end (see *Rev 18:2*; *19:2*).\n\n
14:1	idm83712					 This message for Israel separates two prophecies of judgment against Babylon (ch *13*; *14:3-23*).\n\n
14:1	idm83720					 The Hebrew word here translated **mercy** draws from the imagery of a woman’s maternal care for her child to illustrate God’s merciful love for his people (see also *49:15*; *66:13*). • God had initially chosen Israel as his **special people** when he called Abraham (see *41:8*; *Gen 12:1-3*). Although their status did not change during the Exile, they faced God’s wrath like any other wicked nation because they had rejected him. • **settle once again in their own land:** This promise began to be fulfilled in 538 BC (see *Ezra 1:1-11*). • **People from many different nations** would join Israel as the people of God (see also *Isa 2:3-4*; *11:11-12*; *19:18-25*; *60:1-14*).\n\n
14:2	idm83740					 Just as Israel was subject to the Lord, so the **nations of the world** would submit themselves to the Lord through Israel (*45:14*; *49:7*, *23*; *60:12*, *14*; *66:23*). • The oppressed nation of Israel **will rule over its enemies,** assuming a position of power and favor with God.\n\n
14:3	idm83754					 This taunting song for the king of Babylon is in the form of a funeral dirge (cp. *Rev 18*).\n\n
14:3	idm83761					 God **gives . . . rest** (i.e., *relief;* *28:12*; see *Deut 25:19*; *2 Sam 7:11*) **from** the **sorrow and fear, . . . slavery and chains** Israel experienced under foreign oppressors (see *Isa 9:4*).\n\n
14:4	idm83775					 A **taunt** is a mocking comparison in song form. In this instance, the king of Babylon is compared to a dead man entering the world of the dead.\n\n
14:7	idm83782					 The land and people will be **at rest and quiet** because the oppression has ended and the king of Babylon has died. • The whole creation will join in praise, able to **sing again** (see also *42:11*; *44:23*; cp. *Rom 8:22*).\n\n
14:9	idm83793					 The Babylonians saw the **place of the dead** (Hebrew *Sheol*) as a place of no return. • **stand up** (literally *get up from their thrones*): The thrones reflect the Babylonian concept of the life hereafter as a continuation of the same mode of existence as the present life. It appears that the other kings are honoring the great king of Babylon, but the next verses tell a different story.\n\n
14:10	idm83803					 **weak as we are:** The Babylonian king had no power over anyone after death and was unable to leave *Sheol*. The Israelites will mock this great king who on earth appeared to have no weaknesses.\n\n
14:11	idm83811					 Babylon’s **might and power** and **the sound of the harp** were ended, and its magnificence was destroyed (see also *Rev 18:22*). • **Maggots** and **worms** symbolized death and decomposition (*Isa 66:24*).\n\n
14:12	idm83823					 **fallen from heaven, O shining star:** These words allude to the Canaanite story of the god Helel’s rebellion against the god El (chief deity of the Canaanite pantheon) and his fall from heaven. Some see the fall of the king of Babylon here as symbolizing the fall of Satan (see *Ezek 28*; *Luke 10:18*; *Rev 12:9*). However, there is little to suggest that Isaiah understood it in that way. He was thinking of the historical king of Babylon. • **son of the morning:** The battle took place under the early morning sun. The Latin Vulgate translates the term as *Lucifer* (*morning star*), a name for Satan in Christian tradition, but the Hebrew text makes no apparent reference here to Satan.\n\n
14:13	idm83836					 This verse alludes to the Canaanite belief that the chief god El and the other gods were enthroned on Mount Zaphon, a northern mountain (see *Ps 48:2*; for a New Testament application, see *Matt 11:23*; *Luke 10:15*).\n\n
14:14	idm83845					 **Most High:** See *Gen 14:19-22*.\n\n
14:15	idm83853					 This is a restatement of *14:9-11*. The dead spirits inhabiting **the place of the dead** will be startled and amazed that the Babylonian king, who ruled the world with his merciless might, has absolutely no power in death.\n\n
14:18	idm83861					 The absence of **a proper burial** was a sign of great shame and dishonor. Unlike other kings, the king of Babylon would be disgraced in judgment.\n\n
14:21	idm83868					 As another sign of disgrace, the king of Babylon would have no children to provide a future legacy. • **because of their father’s sins:** God looks at individuals in relationship to their families and their people. Here, the Babylonian king’s children had joint responsibility for their father’s actions (see also *Deut 5:9-10*).\n\n
14:22	idm83876					 Isaiah summarized the previous taunt (*14:3-21*) with this prophecy, spoken in the first person. God decrees the destruction and desolation of Babylon.\n\n
14:24	idm83883					 This prophecy resumes declaring judgment on Assyria (see ch *10*). The placement of this prophecy after the judgment against Babylon suggests close connections between Assyria and Babylon.\n\n
14:24	idm83890					 **I have planned . . . I have decided:** No nation can either diminish or resist God’s plans to bring judgment against Assyria or his plans in general. The prophets understood and communicated God’s plan so that his people could respond appropriately.\n\n
14:25	idm83897					 This prophecy told what would happen when Sennacherib attacked Hezekiah some years later in 701 BC (see chs *36–37*).\n\n
14:26	idm83905					 The Lord’s power over Assyria is just one example of his sovereignty over **the whole earth.**\n\n
14:29	idm83912					 The **king who attacked** Philistia was probably Ahaz (*14:28*). • **a more poisonous snake:** This probably refers to one of the later Assyrian kings, either Sennacherib (701 BC), Esarhaddon (680 BC), or Ashurbanipal (668 BC).\n\n
14:31	idm83924					 The advancing army, probably Assyria, would stir up clouds of dust **like smoke** that were ominously visible in **the north.**\n\n
14:32	idm83932					 **The** Lord** has built Jerusalem:** God was fully willing and capable of defending Judah, and he did not want the kingdom to make alliances with nations such as the Philistines to protect themselves from the invading Assyrians.\n\n
15:1	idm83941					 This message of judgment and lament concerned Moab’s fall. The extensive references to Moabite place names indicate that Isaiah was thoroughly familiar with Moab.\n\n
15:1	idm83947					 **Moab** was Judah’s enemy, situated on the eastern side of the Dead Sea. • **In one night:** Destruction would be sudden and decisive.\n\n
15:2	idm83955					 In the ancient Near East, actions such as **shaving** or **cutting off their beards** revealed deep sorrow (see *Jer 48:37*).\n\n
15:4	idm83964					 **Heshbon** was the former capital of Sihon (*Num 21:23-26*). • **Elealeh** was located close to Heshbon. • **Jahaz** was between Heshbon and the Arnon River (see *Jer 48:34*).\n\n
15:5	idm83975					 **My heart weeps for Moab:** The prophet joined in the lament to express the greatness of Moab’s pain. • **Zoar** was in the southeastern area of the Dead Sea (*Gen 14:2*; *19:23*).\n\n
15:6	idm83985					 Identification of the **waters of Nimrim** is uncertain (see also *Jer 48:34*). • **dried up . . . scorched . . . tender plants:** For the theme of natural resources drying up as a form of judgment, see *study note on Isa 24:4*.\n\n
15:7	idm83995					 The precise locations of the **Ravine of Willows** and of **Eglaim** and **Beer-elim** are uncertain.\n\n
15:9	idm84004					 **Dibon:** The Masoretic Text reads *Dimon,* which is a play on the word translated *blood* (Hebrew *dam*). • **blood:** Apparently many people from Moab had already been killed, but their judgment had only begun.\n\n
16:1	idm84015					 A request for asylum.\n\n
16:1	idm84021					 Moab was known for its sheep (see *2 Kgs 3:4*). The **lambs** were sent as tribute to Judah in recognition of Judah’s sovereignty over Moab. • **Sela** (*the cliff*), an unknown remote site, was apparently where the Moabites escaped **through the desert**.\n\n
16:3	idm84032					 **Do not betray us . . . Hide them:** Moab’s situation would become so dire that they would beg for asylum in other lands.\n\n
16:4	idm84039					 This prophecy of salvation spoke of the future of David’s dynasty. • Activities such as **oppression and destruction** would cease with the end of Moabite hostilities (see *2 Kgs 13:20*).\n\n
16:5	idm84047					 God would **establish one of David’s descendants as king** (see also *9:7*; *11:1-5*, *10-12*).\n\n
16:6	idm84057					 The response to Moab’s request for asylum (*16:1-4*).\n\n
16:6	idm84064					 The Moabites’ hardened state of **pride and arrogance and rage** and **boasting** prevented them from humbling themselves before God.\n\n
16:8	idm84072					 The **vineyards at Sibmah** were located by the Moabite city of **Heshbon.** • Moab was like a luxuriant vine that extends far and wide, but Israel’s beautiful vine reached to the ends of the earth (*27:6*). • The location of **Jazer** is unknown.\n\n
16:12	idm84082					 The hilltops were sites for pagan shrines (see *15:2*). • **No one will be able to save them,** including the idols the Moabites called on for protection (see *40:18-19*; *44:18-19*).\n\n
16:14	idm84092					 **Within three years, counting each day** (literally *Within three years, as a servant bound by contract would count them*; see also *21:16*): A man who had sold himself into servitude for a period of time would calculate how much time remained right down to the final day. This verse refers to events that are unknown. • **The glory of Moab will be ended***,* probably because of the Assyrian conquest of Moab (late 700s BC). • **only a feeble few will be left alive:** Though decimated by war, the Moabites still existed during Nehemiah’s time (*Neh 13:23*).\n\n
17:1	idm84106					 This section contains prophecies of judgment against Damascus, Israel, Ethiopia, and Egypt. The scene moves from the crisis of 734 BC (the alliance of Syria and Israel—see *study note on 7:1-25*) to the Assyrian crisis in 701 BC (see chs *36–37*).\n\n
17:1	idm84116					 **Damascus,** the ringleader in the alliance of Syria and Israel against Judah, fell when the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III invaded in 732 BC.\n\n
17:2	idm84124					 **The towns of Aroer** were east of the Dead Sea (see *2 Kgs 10:32-33*). • **Flocks will graze in the streets:** The city would be useless for any other purpose.\n\n
17:3	idm84133					 The strategic **fortified towns of Israel** were the pride of Israel, but they could not resist God’s purposes.\n\n
17:4	idm84140					 The vision shifts from Damascus (*17:1-3*) to the northern kingdom of Israel; Damascus and Israel were allies in the war against Judah, and both were later destroyed by Assyria.\n\n
17:4	idm84147					 **Israel’s glory will grow dim:** God will judge all human pride. • Israel’s **robust body will waste away** like a person who is ill.\n\n
17:5	idm84155					 The **valley of Rephaim** was a fertile valley in Judah; however, it looked bare after each harvest.\n\n
17:6	idm84162					 Although **the God of Israel** judged the wickedness of Israel, he was still its God.\n\n
17:7	idm84169					 The **people** referred to here are either Israelites or humanity at large. • **look . . . turn their eyes:** They will again put their trust in the Lord.\n\n
17:8	idm84177					 Canaanites and then Israelites worshiped the fertility goddess **Asherah** in wooded areas or, in the absence of wooded areas, using Asherah **poles** (see *27:9*; *65:3*; *Mic 5:14*).\n\n
17:9	idm84188					 The **Hivites and Amorites** were members of the original population of Canaan; they were to be destroyed when the Israelites conquered the land (see *Deut 20:17*).\n\n
17:10	idm84196					 The Israelites had mixed faith in the Lord with elements of Baal worship. They **turned from** the Lord, who alone is God and will not be held alongside an idol in people’s hearts. • The term **Rock** refers to the Lord’s ability to provide refuge (see *26:4*; *30:29*; *Ps 18:2*, *46*). \n\n
17:12	idm84208					 God was present with Judah during the crisis.\n\n
17:12	idm84214					 At times, the **sea** represents opposition to God (see *Job 7:12*; *26:12*; *Pss 46:3*; *93:3*).\n\n
17:13	idm84225					 **God will silence them:** The Lord is sovereign over the nations, as he is over the sea (*Ps 65:7*).\n\n
17:14	idm84233					 **In the evening . . . by dawn:** Despite frightening circumstances, Israel can have confidence in the Lord’s ability to save quickly (see *37:36-38*).\n\n
18:1	idm84241					 **Ethiopia** was at the southern extremity of the kingdom of Egypt. At the time, Egypt was ruled by the dynasty of the Ethiopian Piankhi.\n\n
18:3	idm84248					 Both the **battle flag** and **ram’s horn** were used to marshal and send signals to armies in battle (see *Judg 3:27*; *6:34*; *2 Sam 2:28*).\n\n
18:4	idm84259					 The Lord is untroubled by human activities; he watches **quietly from** his **dwelling place** and acts in his own time (see *Ps 2:1-4*).\n\n
18:5	idm84268					 **your plans are ripening:** Ethiopia had made every effort to form alliances to protect itself against Assyria, but its alliance with Judah would not help.\n\n
18:7	idm84275					 Conquered or weaker nations were often forced to pay tribute to a dominant king in the region (see *16:1*; *2 Kgs 3:4-5*). The Ethiopians would come bringing **gifts** to honor the Lord for his defeat of the Assyrians (see also *2 Chr 32:23*).\n\n
19:1	idm84285					 See also *Jer 46*; *Ezek 29–32*.\n\n
19:1	idm84293					 Egypt was vulnerable, depending on the Nile for food, fish, and industry. When the Lord struck the Nile, Egypt would be in dire straits, and their gods would not be able to help.\n\n
19:1	idm84299					 **Riding on a swift cloud** shows God’s sovereignty and power over creation (*Ps 104:3*). He is coming in judgment against Judah’s enemies (see *Deut 33:26*; *Pss 18:9-10*; *68:4*; *97:2-3*). • **The idols of Egypt tremble** because they are weak and impotent, unable to help (see *Isa 40:18*; *45:16*; *46:1*).\n\n
19:2	idm84315					 Egypt had a history of civil wars that ravaged the country. Egypt’s fragile unity was breaking apart.\n\n
19:3	idm84321					 **Idols . . . spirits, mediums, and those who consult the spirits of the dead** were called upon in an attempt to ward off impending destruction (see *8:19-22*; *47:12-13*).\n\n
19:4	idm84330					 **hard, cruel master:** In 671 BC, the Assyrian king Esarhaddon invaded Egypt and destroyed the royal city of Memphis. In 663 BC, Ashurbanipal attacked and destroyed Thebes (see *Nah 3:8-10*).\n\n
19:5	idm84340					 The **waters of the Nile** were Egypt’s lifeline. Any disturbance in the regular pattern of flooding affected the whole nation. In ancient Egypt, the Nile was considered to be a god. However, the true God could easily dry it up.\n\n
19:9	idm84347					 There was **no flax** or **thread:** The drought crippled the linen industry.\n\n
19:11	idm84355					 The prophet taunted the leaders and wise men of Egypt, who were helpless to avert tragedy.\n\n
19:11	idm84361					 **Zoan** was the capital of Egypt, located in the Nile delta (see *Num 13:22*). • **officials . . . best counsel:** The king depended on the strategies and counsel of wise men (*Isa 19:12*; see *Gen 41:39-40*). • The officials of Zoan were known for **all their wise ancestors***,* and Egypt liked to **brag about** them.\n\n
19:12	idm84375					 **Where are your wise counselors:** Cp. *1 Cor 1:20*.\n\n
19:13	idm84383					 **Memphis** was an ancient capital in Egypt located south of the Nile delta. It was destroyed by Esarhaddon in 671 BC.\n\n
19:15	idm84391					 **There is nothing Egypt can do:** No leader, idol, or conventional wisdom can stand against God’s judgment. • **The head and the tail** represented all of Egypt’s leaders from the greatest to the least important (see *9:14-15*).\n\n
19:16	idm84400					 An **upraised fist** (literally *waving the hand*) was a threatening motion.\n\n
19:18	idm84408					 **five of Egypt’s cities:** This is probably just a way of saying “a number of cities” (see also *17:6*; *30:17*). • Jews living in Egypt after the destruction of Jerusalem spoke Hebrew, here called the **language of Canaan**. • **Heliopolis** was devoted to Re, the sun god. At a time when Judah was resisting the Lord, Isaiah envisioned the Egyptians following the Lord.\n\n
19:19	idm84419					 The new Egypt would receive a place in God’s purposes together with Assyria and Israel.\n\n
19:19	idm84425					 This **altar** or **monument** refers either to the temple that was built by Jews at Elephantine in Egypt (500 BC), to some other Jewish place of worship, or perhaps to a memorial the Egyptians constructed in devotion to the Lord.\n\n
19:20	idm84434					 The altar (*19:19*) would be **a sign and a witness** of the Egyptians’ religious connection with Israel (see *19:24-25*). • God answers the prayers of those who **cry to the** Lord** for help**. • The Lord is **a savior;** he would protect the Egyptians even as he protected Jerusalem from the Assyrians.\n\n
19:22	idm84447					 **strike Egypt:** The Hebrew verb used here is the same as the one used for the tenth plague (*Exod 12:13*, *23*, *27*), bringing up associations of what God did during the Exodus. • The Lord, who brings a plague, can also **bring healing**. • **he will listen to their pleas and heal them:** This expresses a covenantal relationship between the Lord and Egypt (see *Isa 65:24*).\n\n
19:23	idm84460					 Traditionally, **Egypt and Assyria** were enemies of one another and of Israel. They were idolatrous to the core, but they would leave behind their enmity and their idols to **worship** the true **God**. • In the rugged terrain of the ancient Near East, a **highway** provided a means for safe, easy travel and trade (see *11:16*; *35:8*; *40:3*; *62:10*).\n\n
19:24	idm84474					 **Israel will be . . . a blessing** in fulfillment of God’s promise to Abraham (*Gen 12:3*).\n\n
19:25	idm84482					 Two designations usually reserved for Israel, **my people** and **the land I have made** (see *29:22*; *32:18*), are applied here to foreign nations. The Lord promised to regard those from the nations who turn to him as his **special possession** (*63:17*).\n\n
20:1	idm84494					 Ashdod’s reliance on Egypt and Ethiopia was useless. As a complement to his words, Isaiah walked about exposed and barefoot, a symbolic action for what God would do.\n\n
20:1	idm84500					 **Sargon of Assyria** is Sargon II (721–705 BC). • **Ashdod** was one of the five Philistine cities that rebelled against Assyria in 713 BC.\n\n
20:2	idm84510					 Prophets characteristically wore **burlap** or other rough clothing as a sign of mourning over the sins of the people (see *2 Kgs 1:8*; *Mark 1:6*). • **naked:** That is, exposed in some way, possibly even completely nude.\n\n
20:3	idm84520					 This symbolic event took place some **three years** before the fall of Ashdod (see *20:2*). Through it, Isaiah became an object lesson for the people (see *8:18*).\n\n
20:5	idm84529					 Philistia’s downfall was a warning to the people of Judah, who also relied on Egypt and other alliances rather than on God.\n\n
21:1	idm84535					 **concerning Babylon—the desert by the sea:** This description of Babylon was perhaps an ironic way to say that the land was physically lush but spiritually desolate. • **Disaster . . . from the desert:** Literally *from the desert, from the terrifying land* (cp. *Deut 8:15*).\n\n
21:2	idm84545					 **I see:** The prophet personalized Babylon’s experience, which intensifies his poetry, as does the terse language and the repetition of similar sounds, such as **the betrayer betraying** (Hebrew *habboged boged*) and **the destroyer destroying** (Hebrew *hashoded shoded;* also in *33:1*). • The **Elamites** lived to the northeast of Babylon. Along with the Medes, they were archrivals of the Babylonians. • **I will make an end to all the groaning Babylon caused:** Babylon had caused groaning by attacking and enslaving many nations. It is likely that the **Elamites and Medes** played a part in the overthrow of Babylon in 539 BC (*21:9*).\n\n
21:3	idm84562					 **I grow faint . . . I am too afraid:** Through his vision, Isaiah experienced the terror of the Babylonian people (see also *Dan 8:27*; *10:16-17*).\n\n
21:7	idm84571					 The **riders** were messengers who reported what had taken place on the battlefield.\n\n
21:9	idm84578					 **Babylon is fallen, fallen:** Assyrian king Sennacherib destroyed the city of Babylon in 689 BC. The final fall of Babylon was in 539 BC. In Scripture, **Babylon** represents all the ungodly power structures of this world, including nations and kingdoms that do not submit to God and his word. The apostle John gave hope with his prophecy that all Babylons will fall (*Rev 14:8*; *18:2*). • **All the idols of Babylon lie broken:** False gods could not save the Babylonians (see *Isa 46:1-2*).\n\n
21:10	idm84592					 **O my people: **The focus shifted back to the people of Judah. • Judah would be oppressed (**threshed and winnowed**) by the Babylonians but Babylon, too, would fall. • **I have told you everything:** The prophet had been faithful in his duty to report what the Lord revealed to him.\n\n
21:11	idm84601					 These two prophecies pertain to Edom and Arabia, located in the territory between Babylon and Israel. These outlying regions suffered under Assyrian domination, and like Judah, they would not be able to rest under Babylon’s oppressive regime.\n\n
21:11	idm84607					 **Edom:** Hebrew *Seir*, which was the mountainous area of Edom. • **how much longer until morning:** Edom’s suffering would be a long ordeal. The Assyrians were dominant in the ancient Near East during the 700s and 600s BC.\n\n
21:12	idm84617					 **Morning is coming***,* but it would mark the beginning of another oppressive era. Because the Babylonians were on the horizon, **night will soon return**.\n\n
21:13	idm84626					 Cp. *Jer 49:28-33*.\n\n
21:13	idm84633					 **Dedan** was a tribe in Arabia (see *Ezek 27:20*; *38:13*). • **Caravans** would **hide in the deserts of Arabia** from attacks by the Assyrians and Babylonians, both of whom harassed the Arabian tribes (see *Isa 21:1-10*; *Jer 49:28-29*).\n\n
21:14	idm84646					 **Tema** was an oasis in Arabia on a main trade route from Babylon.\n\n
21:15	idm84653					 Assyrian weapons of war such as **the drawn sword** and **the bent bow** were highly advanced compared to the primitive weapons used by desert peoples.\n\n
21:16	idm84661					 **Kedar** was an Arabian tribe that had great wealth and possessions (see *60:7*; *Ezek 27:21*).\n\n
21:17	idm84670					 **Only a few . . . will survive:** Cp. *10:22*; *14:30*; *16:14*; *24:6*, *13*; *37:32*.\n\n
22:1	idm84683					 This message addresses the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem in 701 BC (see chs *36–37*; *2 Kgs 18:17–19:37*) and perhaps the people’s preparation for the subsequent Babylonian siege in 588–586 BC.\n\n
22:1	idm84693					 The prophet rebukes the people for their excitement over the Assyrian retreat (701 BC). They did not foresee that the Babylonian army would later (in 586 BC) complete what the Assyrians failed to do, namely, the destruction of Jerusalem.\n\n
22:1	idm84701					 **concerning Jerusalem—the Valley of Vision:** The meaning of the Hebrew phrase is uncertain. Assuming that it refers to Jerusalem (see *22:5*), it is ironic: Jerusalem sits atop a hill, and visions were not typically thought to originate in a *valley.* Similarly, Jerusalem was proud of its self-perceived religious *vision*, but its inhabitants were spiritually blind (see *6:10*; *42:18*).\n\n
22:2	idm84713					 The **reveling city** was full of feasting and drinking (*22:13*; see *23:7*; *32:13*), probably in response to the Assyrian retreat. Now a new threat approaches—the Babylonian siege (586 BC). • The people died **not in battle but by famine and disease**. Siege warfare left the inhabitants of the city cut off from needed agricultural resources and in a terrible sanitation and health crisis.\n\n
22:3	idm84725					 **Leaders** might try to flee, but they would not escape (see *2 Kgs 25:4-6*).\n\n
22:4	idm84733					 **Leave me alone to weep:** Isaiah mourned the victims and the decimation of his people (see *6:13*).\n\n
22:5	idm84741					 The defeat of Judah would be a manifestation of the yet-future day of the Lord (see *study note on 2:5-22*). Jerusalem would be impotent in the day of disaster.\n\n
22:5	idm84748					 Jerusalem’s **walls** were **broken** by the invading Babylonians, who breached them with battering rams (*2 Kgs 25:4*).\n\n
22:6	idm84757					 **Elamites:** Elam was to the east of Babylon and would later play a role in Babylon’s defeat (see *21:2*; also *Jer 49:34-39*). • The actual location of **Kir** is unknown (see also *Amos 1:5*).\n\n
22:7	idm84768					 The Kidron and Hinnom **valleys** were located to the east and south of Jerusalem.\n\n
22:8	idm84775					 The inhabitants of Jerusalem planned for war by counting weapons, checking walls, and preparing a water supply. However, the people did not consider God’s plans (see *13:1–14:23*). Although Hezekiah was very prominent in these efforts, the second person verbs are plural. Isaiah was apparently not singling out Hezekiah, as he did Hezekiah’s father Ahaz (*7:1-4*).\n\n
22:8	idm84783					 **to the armory:** This magnificent building was both an armory and a storage place for valuables (see *39:2*; *1 Kgs 7:2-6*).\n\n
22:9	idm84792					 **Jerusalem** (literally *the city of David*): Calling Jerusalem “the city of David” evokes memories of Israel’s greatest king and God’s blessing upon him and the nation (see also *60:14*). • **You store up water in the lower pool:** Hezekiah expended great energy in ensuring a constant supply of water (see *22:11*; *2 Kgs 20:20*).\n\n
22:12	idm84804					 Judah’s feasting and disobedience resulted in a prophecy of judgment.\n\n
22:14	idm84810					 **you will never be forgiven for this sin:** The people of Judah added sin upon sin to the point that God would justly condemn them. This foreshadowed the Exile; although it took place in 586 BC, Isaiah was already anticipating it in 701 BC.\n\n
22:15	idm84819					 Shebna and Eliakim were two royal officials in King Hezekiah’s court (see *2 Kgs 18:18*; *19:2*). Apparently assuming that death at the hands of the Assyrians was inevitable, Shebna planned for an ostentatious burial place (*Isa 22:16*). Although the rebuke of Shebna preceded Assyria’s siege of Jerusalem in 701 BC (see *22:19-21*; *36:3*), it connects well with the admonitions of *22:1-13* regarding the ensuing Babylonian siege.\n\n
22:15	idm84832					 The actions of **Shebna** represent among the populace a lack of confidence in God’s ability to rescue Jerusalem from the Assyrian attack. • A **palace administrator** held the highest possible position in the royal court (see *22:21-22*).\n\n
22:16	idm84841					 Shebna was **building a beautiful tomb . . . a monument**. This lavish burial place was intended to last for centuries.\n\n
22:18	idm84848					 **toss you away into a distant, barren land:** Shebna would not find a resting place or have a memorial (cp. *14:11-20*). • **your glorious chariots:** In his high position, Shebna had lived in luxury.\n\n
22:19	idm84857					 **drive you out of office:** Shebna (*22:15*) was demoted to court secretary by the time of Jerusalem’s siege, when **Eliakim** (*22:20*) was the palace administrator (*36:3*). Eliakim was a true **servant** of the Lord.\n\n
22:21	idm84869					 A leader is like **a father to the people** when he truly cares for them and addresses their needs. In contrast, Shebna was concerned only for himself.\n\n
22:22	idm84876					 **The key to the house of David** represents a high position of honor in the royal court (see also *Rev 3:7*). • **When he opens doors . . . when he closes doors:** The officer with **the highest position** has sole authority in giving access to the king (cp. *Matt 16:19*).\n\n
22:25	idm84887					 **I will pull out the nail:** Even godly Eliakim would not be able to save Judah or David’s dynasty from God’s judgment. The people of Judah would go into exile more than a century later (*39:6-7*).\n\n
23:1	idm84895					 Tyre was a prosperous seaport northwest of Israel. The relationship between Judah and Tyre went back to the time of David and Solomon (*1 Kgs 5:8-9*). Tyre, with its proximity to plentiful forests and to the Mediterranean Sea, was one of the commercial centers of the ancient Near East. Its fleets were renowned, and its colonies brought it great prestige and riches. The city came under repeated attack by the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Macedonians, and it fell to Alexander the Great in 332 BC. Isaiah not only prophesied the end of Tyre but by implication warned all whose wealth and earthly securities lead to pride instead of dependence on God (see *Isa 2:12-16*; *Matt 11:21*).\n\n
23:1	idm84905					 The **ships of Tarshish** plied the sea between the Phoenician coast and the port of Tarshish in Spain (see *2:16*; *23:6*). • **rumors you heard in Cyprus:** Cyprus was the last port of call for sailors coming home from Spain before the final leg of their journey to Tyre.\n\n
23:2	idm84915					 **Sidon** was a Phoenician port to the north of Tyre. • Tyre’s commercial network of **traders** was extensive.\n\n
23:3	idm84923					 Fish, agricultural produce, flax, and linen were all **harvests from along the Nile** (see ch *19*). • Tyre was known as **the marketplace of the world,** comparable to modern cities like New York, Hong Kong, or London.\n\n
23:4	idm84932					 Part of the great port city of Tyre was on an island. The island city was a **fortress of the sea***,* but it fell in 332 BC. • **I am childless; I have no sons or daughters:** This metaphor was a judgment on Tyre’s colonial ports around the Mediterranean Sea. In the ancient world, to reach old age without having children was considered a terrible fate (see *49:21*; *54:1*).\n\n
23:5	idm84944					 **Egypt** depended on the ships from Tyre for the export of its products (see *23:3*).\n\n
23:8	idm84952					 The Lord had **brought this disaster on Tyre** (*23:9*). • Through commercial links, Tyre had created wealth for itself and its trading partners; in this sense, Tyre was a **great creator of kingdoms**.\n\n
23:10	idm84961					 **Sweep over the land like the flooding Nile:** This difficult phrase means either (1) that the sailors who had returned from Tarshish were being invited to loot ruined Tyre; or (2) that the people of Tarshish were forced to move back to their agricultural fields to make their living (instead of trading) now that Tyre had been destroyed.\n\n
23:11	idm84968					 **Phoenicia** was the region north of Israel. Tyre and Sidon were its main cities.\n\n
23:13	idm84975					 **Babylonia** was stripped and looted by the Assyrians under Sennacherib (689 BC); eventually it rose to be a mighty empire once again.\n\n
23:15	idm84983					 There was hope for Tyre.\n\n
23:17	idm84989					 Metaphorically, Tyre was **a prostitute** because of its indifferent willingness to sell anything to anyone (cp. *Rev 17:2*; *18:3*, *12-13*).\n\n
23:18	idm84999					 Even though Tyre’s earnings came from unrighteous commerce, the **profits will be given to the** Lord rather than being squandered. • There will be **good food and fine clothing for the** Lord**’s priests**. The theme of the wealth of the nations being brought to the Lord in Jerusalem is more fully developed in *60:5-11*; *61:6*.\n\n
24:1	idm85012					 This section is often referred to as the “Little Apocalypse” because of its similarities to the book of Revelation. In these chapters Isaiah takes readers out of the present into a vision of the future world. The universal imagery of the Little Apocalypse makes it difficult to assign the events described to any precise historical situation. That means that these chapters cannot be used to outline a sequence of events or create a historical blueprint for the future. Instead, the imagery is intended to create an impressionistic drama of an unfolding world that is both like and unlike the present. The combination of aspects of the old era with aspects of the new era (for instance, people of Zion will all be righteous [new], but still long for their redemption [old]) is consistent with the New Testament concept of the future age breaking into and overlapping with the present evil age (*2 Cor 4:4*; *Gal 1:4*). Peter, for example, wrote of believers as living in the last days (*1 Pet 1:12*; *2 Pet 3:3*) even though the last day remains yet future (*2 Pet 3:10*).\n\n
24:1	idm85023					 Here the judgments described in chs *13–23* are extended to the creation at large.\n\n
24:1	idm85030					 **destroy the earth and make it a vast wasteland:** There is a play here on the Hebrew words *baqaq* (*destroy*) and *balaq* (*make a wasteland*). The devastation will begin with Judah and be extended to the whole world (see *1 Pet 4:17*). • All **the earth** will be destroyed, **the people** as well as national political structures.\n\n
24:4	idm85044					 All humanity is guilty (*Rom 3:23*) and under condemnation (see *Isa 59:1-15*). Judgment is likened to a failed grape harvest that brings drinking and feasting to a halt.\n\n
24:4	idm85052					 **earth . . . dries up . . . land wastes away and withers:** The prophets often used the imagery of a drought to get the attention of people who live off the land (see also *Jer 23:10*; *Joel 1:12*; *Amos 1:2*).\n\n
24:5	idm85062					 Isaiah was probably referring to the **everlasting covenant** that God made with all humanity through Noah (*Gen 9:8-17*). The prophet saw a parallel with the wickedness in his day and the wickedness of the pre-flood world.\n\n
24:6	idm85070					 The effect of sin is so great that no earthly thing or action can adequately atone for it. Hope ultimately lies in God himself. God has reconciled the world to himself in Christ (*Col 1:19-20*).\n\n
24:7	idm85077					 **Merrymakers** will **sigh and mourn** because they are dependent on wine for pleasure.\n\n
24:8	idm85085					 **Tambourines** and **melodious chords of the harp** represent good times (see *5:12*; *Rev 18:22*).\n\n
24:10	idm85095					 **city writhes in chaos:** With normal levels of urban disarray being raised to chaotic and dangerous disorder, people will be forced to seek refuge in **locked** homes.\n\n
24:11	idm85103					 **Gladness has been banished from the land***,* not by edict, but because there is no reason to celebrate.\n\n
24:13	idm85111					 **stray olives left on the tree:** The remnant will include godly people both from Israel (see *17:6*) and from other nations. • The theme of the **remnant** is common in Isaiah (see “*The Remnant*” Theme Note; see also *10:22*; *14:30*; *16:14*; *24:6*; *37:32*).\n\n
24:14	idm85126					 In spite of wailing and ruin, the sound of praise is heard from all directions. Even while still experiencing the pain of the devastation of the old world, the godly will respond with joyous expectation for the new world.\n\n
24:16	idm85132					 **But my heart is heavy with grief:** The prophets were well acquainted with the emotional pain brought on by the sin of their people and its consequences (see *15:5*; *21:4*; *Jer 15:10*; *Mic 1:8*). • Although aspects of the new world are present, the **deceit** of the old world **still prevails** for a time.\n\n
24:18	idm85145					 No one can **escape** the day of the Lord (see *study note on 2:5-22*). • **Destruction falls like rain from the heavens** (literally *the floodgates of heaven are opened*): The imagery is like the flood in Noah’s time (see *study note on Gen 7:11-12*). • **the foundations of the earth shake:** An earthquake is characteristic of a *theophany,* a physical manifestation of God’s presence (see also *Isa 6:4*; *13:13*; *19:1*).\n\n
24:21	idm85161					 The phrase translated **gods** (Hebrew *tseba’ hammarom**,* “armed host of the heavens”) might refer to pagan gods represented by the stars. It might also refer to the angels or even demons (*Rev 12:4*, *9*). Judgment will extend to all parts of creation (*Isa 13:13*; *34:5*; see *Eph 6:11-12*).\n\n
24:22	idm85175					 **put in prison . . . punished:** See also *2 Pet 2:4*; *Rev 9:2*, *11*; *17:8*.\n\n
25:1	idm85186					 The second part of the Little Apocalypse (see *study note on 24:1–27:13*) describes praise for God’s judgment (*25:1-5*, *11-12*) and salvation (*25:6-9*).\n\n
25:1	idm85196					 Isaiah here praises God for protecting the needy (see *12:1-6*).\n\n
25:3	idm85203					 Assyria and Egypt were **strong . . . ruthless nations***,* but in the future they will exalt God rather than their own power.\n\n
25:6	idm85211					 The banquet is a symbol of God’s providing richly for all those who will receive his gracious invitation (*Rev 3:20-21*; *19:9*).\n\n
25:6	idm85219					 **In Jerusalem:** Literally *On this mountain*—that is, the mountain of the Lord (see *2:2*; *24:23*): This does not refer to a geographical city but to Zion, the eternal city of God (see *1:8*, *27*).\n\n
25:8	idm85231					 **He will swallow up death forever:** Isaiah’s hope was God’s power over sin and sin’s devastating results. In the New Testament this promise is realized in Jesus Christ (*1 Cor 15:54*). • The Lord’s presence will be a source of eternal comfort; he will **wipe away all tears** (see *Rev 21:4*).\n\n
25:9	idm85241					 The new community of God’s people will respond in joy and faith. When the enemy is defeated, God’s people will be free forever.\n\n
25:10	idm85247					 **on Jerusalem:** Literally *on this mountain.* • **Moab** (see *15:1–16:14*) here represents the nations under judgment, those who trust only themselves (see *34:5-17*). • **like straw trampled down:** The people would be helpless and dying in the most degrading circumstances.\n\n
25:11	idm85259					 Isaiah used the image of a **swimmer** forcibly kept under **water** to illustrate that **Moab’s people** are hopelessly doomed and their human pride will be conquered.\n\n
26:1	idm85268					 This section of the Little Apocalypse (see *study note on 24:1–27:13*) is a song of praise and a prayer for redemption.\n\n
26:1	idm85275					 The new community of God’s people is likened to the citizens of a city, securely held together by the Lord. They are righteous, faithful, peaceful, and trusting.\n\n
26:1	idm85281					 **Our city** refers to Zion, the eternal city of God, where the Lord is present to protect and bless his people (see *1:8*, *27*; see also *Ps 46*). Zion stands in direct contrast to the “mighty cities” of the nations (*Isa 25:2*; *26:5*), which are helpless and are brought down to “ruins.” • The **walls of God’s salvation** protectively enclose his people; no one can hurt them again.\n\n
26:2	idm85294					 **Open** access is given to **all who***,* like God and his Messiah, are **righteous** and **faithful**. The citizens of true Zion are committed to the Lord.\n\n
26:3	idm85305					 A **perfect peace,** marked by harmony, quietness, and confidence, is a benefit of the new creation.\n\n
26:5	idm85312					 The **proud** and **arrogant** are often characterized as exalting themselves (see *2:11-12*), whereas God **humbles** them.\n\n
26:6	idm85322					 Justice finally occurs when **the needy walk all over** the ruins of the city where the proud have perished.\n\n
26:7	idm85329					 The godly pray for the end of oppression and the full establishment of God’s kingdom. Isaiah encouraged the godly to persevere as they wait for their final vindication and the resurrection of the body.\n\n
26:7	idm85335					 God will do **what is right** for those who walk in his way, even if they have to suffer a while longer (see *24:16*). One day, they will experience harmony and integrity (see *Prov 2:8-9*; *15:19*).\n\n
26:8	idm85345					 **we show our trust** (see *26:3-4*; literally *we wait for you*): Waiting involves trust in the Lord and longing for his redemption. • People express their commitment to God **by obeying** his **laws;** mere lip service is not sufficient.\n\n
26:9	idm85356					 **I search . . . I earnestly seek:** Cp. *Ps 63:1*.\n\n
26:10	idm85364					 God has shown **kindness to the wicked.** Although they deserve judgment (see also *Rom 2:4*; *2 Pet 3:9*), he has been patient and forbearing and has blessed them. However, time will run out one day.\n\n
26:11	idm85373					 An **upraised fist** expresses anger and the threat of judgment (see also *19:16*). • **Fire** was often an image for God’s judgment.\n\n
26:15	idm85382					 This verse is a confident expression of thanks for God’s blessings. In Isaiah’s time, during King Hezekiah’s prosperous reign, the **borders** of the **nation** of Israel were **extended***,* and people gave glory to God for his great deeds.\n\n
26:16	idm85392					 While waiting for God’s salvation (*26:1*), the godly were **in distress** and longed for their vindication. They **prayed beneath the burden** of God’s **discipline**. In Hezekiah’s time, Judah was in distress when Sennacherib attacked and destroyed the whole nation except for Jerusalem.\n\n
26:17	idm85402					 The imagery of **a pregnant woman** in childbirth describes the nation’s pain when Assyrian king Sennacherib attacked it in 701 BC (see *37:3*).\n\n
26:18	idm85411					 Only God can give **salvation** and bring **life** (see *59:9-15*).\n\n
26:19	idm85420					 **those who die . . . will live:** There is hope for the remnant. Some hold the minimal interpretation that this means the people would be restored to the land after the Exile (see *Ezek 37:11-12*) or that the Lord would preserve Jerusalem (see *Isa 29:4*, *6-8*). More likely it refers to the resurrection of the body from the grave (see *25:7-8*). The Old Testament has little to say about the resurrection, but this text anticipates fuller development in the New Testament (see *1 Cor 15:12-58*).\n\n
26:20	idm85432					 God will punish the wicked, so the godly should **go home** and stay out of the way.\n\n
26:21	idm85439					 The wicked retain power now, but their oppressive rule will end in the day of the Lord’s wrath, when he will **punish** them **for their sins**.\n\n
27:1	idm85447					 Israel adapted the imagery of **Leviathan** to refer to evil powers that oppose God. **Leviathan**’s death symbolizes the end of evil, Satan, the demonic, and the dominion of forces hostile to God (see *51:9*; *Pss 74:14*; *104:7-9*, *26*; see also the serpent in *Gen 3*; *Rev 12*; *13*; *16:13*; *20:2*, *10*).\n\n
27:2	idm85465					 The Song of the Fruitful Vineyard, in which the vineyard represents God’s people (cp. *5:1-7*).\n\n
27:3	idm85472					 God identifies himself as **the** Lord of the covenant to assure his people that what he says and does is reliable (see *Exod 6:2-3*). The phrase is used many times throughout Isaiah. • **watch . . . watering . . . watch:** The Lord will provide even greater care and protection for his ultimate vineyard than he did for Israel, his first vineyard (see *Isa 5:1-2*).\n\n
27:5	idm85483					 God expects all his people to **turn to** him and to trust him **for help**. • **Let them make peace with me** is God’s offer of reconciliation for his people.\n\n
27:6	idm85492					 **Jacob’s descendants will take root** and the remnant will increase (*37:31*; cp. *5:24*; *14:30*; for application to the Messiah, see *11:1*, *10*). • **fill the whole earth:** The fulfillment of this prophecy extends beyond the restoration of Israel from exile to the second coming of the Lord Jesus. It includes all the righteous children of God—Jews and Gentiles—who suffer but remain obedient as they wait for the fullness of redemption (see *26:18*; *John 15:1-8*).\n\n
27:7	idm85507					 Isaiah reminded readers of the reasons for the Exile and judgment: Israel’s sinfulness, God’s righteous judgment, and the absence of divine compassion.\n\n
27:7	idm85513					 Despite being God’s covenant people, Israel was **struck** and **punished** like any other wicked nation. However, Israel was not completely destroyed; a remnant remained.\n\n
27:8	idm85521					 The Assyrians **exiled** large numbers of citizens from the northern kingdom of Israel when Samaria fell in 722 BC. The Babylonians exiled many from Judah from 605 to 586 BC. • Storms **from the east** were known for their destructive effects (see *Job 27:21*; *38:24*; *Jer 4:11*).\n\n
27:9	idm85534					 God’s justice requires him to punish sin. That punishment is designed to correct behavior and to purify. Being conquered and exiled wasThe Exile occurred so that **to purge Israel’s wickedness** and **to take away all her sin** (see *Rom 11:27*). • This was to be the end of **all the pagan** worship in Israel, including the incense altars and the poles that were used in worshiping the goddess **Asherah**.\n\n
27:10	idm85545					 Places previously associated with human power and accomplishment would be ruined to the extent that animals would **graze** in them.\n\n
27:11	idm85552					 **The people** were outside of God’s covenantal care; they foolishly **turned away** from him.\n\n
27:12	idm85560					 **Yet:** God’s withholding of mercy from Israel (*27:11*) will be temporary. • **from the Euphrates River . . . to the Brook of Egypt:** God’s remnant will return from Assyria and Egypt to the territory that God promised to Abraham (*Gen 15:18*; see *1 Kgs 4:21*).\n\n
27:13	idm85571					  The **great trumpet** was used to gather the people (see *Matt 24:31*).\n\n
28:1	idm85579					 This section is connected by a series of six threats of judgment or woes (cp. *5:8-23*). Apart from the initial address to Samaria in *28:1-13*, the remainder of the section is addressed to Judah, especially because of their inclination to trust Egypt to rescue them from Assyria (*30:2*).\n\n
28:1	idm85588					 The glory of Samaria, capital of the northern kingdom of Israel, is here contrasted with the glory of the Lord. This section represents the first of the six woes (**What sorrow . . .**).\n\n
28:1	idm85595					 The **drunks of Israel** epitomized pride, spiritual complacency, and scorn for God and his commands. • Unlike Jerusalem, Samaria was in a **fertile valley.**\n\n
28:2	idm85603					 **the Lord will send:** The covenant God will act against his own people, whose behavior had effectively disqualified them as God’s people (see *Hos 1:9*). • The **mighty army** is that of the Assyrians, who destroyed Samaria in 722 BC.\n\n
28:5	idm85613					 In the future, after God’s judgment has purged his people, he will restore a righteous remnant, transforming the desires and character of his people. Samaria will no longer be the source of Israel’s pride; instead, they will glory in the Lord, their true **crown.**\n\n
28:7	idm85620					 The focus returns to the lamentable present situation in Israel (and Judah). The leaders and people will be ensnared by their own schemes.\n\n
28:7	idm85626					 The **priests and prophets** led the people astray. • Intoxicating beverages such as **wine** and **alcohol** were prohibited for priests while fulfilling their duties (*Lev 10:9*).\n\n
28:9	idm85636					 The people had become hardened to God’s revelation (*1 Cor 14:21*).\n\n
28:11	idm85643					 **God will have to speak** through circumstances such as hardship, exile, and death in order to get through to his hardened people. • **a strange language:** In the New Testament, Paul applied this text to the spiritual gift of tongues as a sign of judgment to unbelievers (see *1 Cor 14:21-22*).\n\n
28:12	idm85652					 Had **his people** listened, God’s revelation would have led them to **rest** (see *48:18-19*). **But they would not listen** because of their hard hearts (*65:12*).\n\n
28:13	idm85663					 **one line at a time, one line at a time, a little here, and a little there:** The Hebrew here is difficult to understand. The words might be intentional nonsense to illustrate the point that the people were so spiritually blind that God’s clearest revelation was nonsense to them (see *6:9-10*).\n\n
28:14	idm85671					 After having pronounced judgment on Samaria (*28:1-13*), Isaiah now pronounces judgment on **Jerusalem.** The leaders of Judah are accused of being as blind as those in the northern kingdom of Israel.\n\n
28:15	idm85679					 **cheat death** (literally *have made a covenant with death*) **. . . dodge the grave:** There are two interpretive possibilities: (1) The people had sold themselves to the Canaanite god of death, Mot, in return for his supposed protection. (2) The prophet was being sarcastic; the people thought their various political and economic moves guaranteed their personal security, but they had actually destroyed themselves. • **lies and deception:** The leaders did not think of themselves as deceptive, but they were.\n\n
28:16	idm85689					 The Lord himself is the reliable **foundation stone in Jerusalem,** **a precious cornerstone** of the true city of God. There would be real hope in Jerusalem if the leaders and the people would only turn to him. If they would trust in God, they would be secure in the most terrible storm or the most devastating earthquake (see *8:14*; *Ps 118:22*; *Matt 7:24-27*; *21:42*; see the application to Jesus Christ, *Rom 9:33*; *10:11*; *1 Cor 3:11*; *Eph 2:20*; *1 Pet 2:4-7*).\n\n
28:17	idm85706					 The Lord judges people on their works, which reveal the presence or absence of living faith (for **justice** and **righteousness***,* see *1:21-23*).\n\n
28:20	idm85716					 **The bed. . . . The blankets:** The leaders were ill-prepared for God’s coming in judgment.\n\n
28:21	idm85723					 **as he did . . . at Mount Perazim:** See *2 Sam 5:20*. • God had rescued Israel through a hailstorm **at Gibeon** (*Josh 10:10-12*), but now he would turn against them.\n\n
28:23	idm85733					 **Listen to me:** The analogy that follows was written as a wisdom poem, with Isaiah calling on his audience to pay careful attention and to discern what is right.\n\n
28:24	idm85740					 **A farmer** knows that there are right and wrong ways to do things, but the leaders of Judah were not that intelligent.\n\n
28:27	idm85747					 The Lord has a variety of means (**a heavy sledge . . . a light stick**) for accomplishing his purposes. There are degrees of judgment.\n\n
28:28	idm85754					 **he doesn’t keep on pounding it:** This process would end; after judgment would come redemption.\n\n
28:29	idm85761					 **wonderful teacher** (or *counselor;* see *9:6*): God’s people should learn wisdom about God’s ways, as the farmer has done.\n\n
29:1	idm85770					 This is the second of the six woes (**What sorrow . . .**).\n\n
29:1	idm85777					 In the Assyrian siege, the Lord would be fighting against Jerusalem, but he would force the Assyrians to abandon Jerusalem in his own time.\n\n
29:1	idm85783					 **Ariel** was another name for Mount Zion (*29:8*); it probably means *altar of God*.\n\n
29:3	idm85792					 The Lord himself would come against Jerusalem, **surrounding** and **attacking** it.\n\n
29:4	idm85800					 God’s goal was to destroy the sinful pride of the people of Jerusalem. Their voice would rise as if **from the grave.** Through the Assyrians, God would humble his people, but he would not abandon them.\n\n
29:6	idm85807					 **will act for you** (literally *you will be visited*): God would bring rescue for his people. • **thunder and earthquake . . . storm and consuming fire:** These phenomena indicate a theophany (see *study note on 5:25*).\n\n
29:7	idm85817					 The Assyrians’ sudden lifting of the siege came **like a dream . . . like a vision in the night**. God would save Judah and judge Assyria.\n\n
29:8	idm85824					 Jerusalem’s blindness kept its people from understanding God’s plan.\n\n
29:8	idm85830					 Like a **hungry** or **thirsty person,** the Assyrians could taste the victory over Jerusalem. Yet they never became victorious.\n\n
29:10	idm85838					 **a spirit of deep sleep:** The people’s folly was reinforced by God’s judgment on them (cp. *Rom 1:24-32*; *11:8*); they had no perception of reality. • **Prophets** were also sometimes called **visionaries**. Neither the people nor their prophets would understand what God was doing (*Isa 6:9-10*).\n\n
29:13	idm85850					 **These people** used pious-sounding language in their prayers and talk (see *Matt 15:8*; *Mark 7:6-7*), but they did not truly **honor** God. • In **their hearts,** they were not committed to the Lord at all. • In **their worship,** they followed **man-made rules** and regulations rather than God’s word.\n\n
29:14	idm85863					 Human **wisdom . . . intelligence . . . will disappear** (see *1 Cor 1:19*). The prophet had already spoken of the failure of Egypt’s wise men (*Isa 19:11-12*); even Judah’s wise men would blunder.\n\n
29:15	idm85872					 This threat of coming judgment is the third of the six woes (see *study note on 28:1–33:24*). It begins with judgment but moves to a vision of creation being renewed and of the wicked coming to an end.\n\n
29:15	idm85879					 **Their plans** might refer to the advice that royal counselors were giving Hezekiah, who at first attempted to free himself from Assyria by making alliances with Egypt (715 or 701 BC). • The people were conspiring to commit **evil deeds** in secret, but God saw everything.\n\n
29:16	idm85888					 **Potter . . . clay:** The Lord’s sovereignty is beyond challenge. Scripture does not discourage asking God hard questions, but there is no place for resistance to God’s will (see *10:15*; *45:9*; *64:8*; *Rom 9:20*). • **He didn’t make me:** Such claims against God demonstrate a total unwillingness to recognize God’s intimate involvement with every aspect of a person’s life.\n\n
29:17	idm85900					 **The forests of Lebanon** are usually an image of luxuriant growth (see *2:13*; *14:8*), but here they represent desolation.\n\n
29:18	idm85909					 The people were **deaf** and **blind** in heart and spirit (see *6:10*; *42:18*; *43:8*). Yet humanity and all of creation would be renewed (see *35:1-5*).\n\n
29:21	idm85921					 The **false testimony** that led to the oppression of the poor through **trickery** in the courts of Isaiah’s era would end. Because of God’s work in their hearts, the people would turn from their sinful behavior of the past.\n\n
29:22	idm85929					 The prophecy of woe, which began at *29:15*, now ends with a prophecy of salvation.\n\n
29:22	idm85936					 **Abraham** was the father of all Israel (see *Gen 12:1-3*; see also *Gal 3:29*). • Rescued from human abuse and God’s judgment, the people would **no longer be ashamed;** their disgrace resulted from the apparent failure of what they had trusted (see *Ps 71:1*; *1 Pet 2:6*).\n\n
30:1	idm85948					 After threatening Judah with judgment because of their stubbornness and their reliance on Egypt (*30:1-17*), God again committed himself to deal compassionately with his people and to break the power of their enemies.\n\n
30:1	idm85955					 This prophecy was against Judah’s dependence on Egypt. It is the fourth of the six woes (see *study note on 28:1–33:24*).\n\n
30:1	idm85962					 The wisdom of the people of Judah was **not directed by** God’s **Spirit** (cp. *11:2*); instead, they had formed **alliances** that God did not approve of. Although the Assyrian attack on Jerusalem was overwhelming, making an alliance with Egypt demonstrated that the leaders of Judah depended on human resources for their protection rather than on God. Fortunately, Hezekiah later had a change of heart (see chs *36–37*).\n\n
30:4	idm85973					 **Zoan:** See *19:11*. The location of **Hanes** is uncertain.\n\n
30:6	idm85982					 This taunt was against those who were busy trying to please the Egyptians in order to get Egypt’s military support.\n\n
30:6	idm85988					 Caravans moved from Judah through **the Negev** and the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt to avoid the main coast road that was under Assyrian control. It was a dangerous region, filled with **lions** and **poisonous snakes**. People would risk their lives to make a worthless alliance. • Being **weighed down with riches** might refer to money being sent to Egypt to buy that nation’s help.\n\n
30:7	idm85998					 **Harmless Dragon:** In ancient mythology, Rahab was the enemy of the good gods and was depicted in fearsome terms, somewhat like a giant crocodile (see *27:1*; *51:9*; *Job 41:1-34*). By saying that Egypt was *harmless,* the prophet meant that it would be of no help to Judah.\n\n
30:8	idm86009					 God instructed the prophet to write down the vision for future generations. The present generation was rebellious; they rejected God’s word in favor of the false prophets’ fantasies (see *8:16-17*).\n\n
30:11	idm86016					 **Stop telling us:** The people of Judah did not want to be confronted about sin or judgment.\n\n
30:12	idm86023					 Judgment would suddenly overtake the people of Judah because they were content with their fantasy world, and they refused God’s path to rest and quietness.\n\n
30:12	idm86029					 The whole society accepted **oppression and lies**. People reinforced each other’s delusions, so it was considered acceptable to trust that Egypt would protect them from Assyria, even though that was a lie. It was also considered legal and legitimate to oppress the poor by taking their land.\n\n
30:15	idm86036					 The people of Judah needed to repent of their sinful ways (*30:12-14*), **returning** to the Lord, in order to be rescued. • Trust in the Lord would bring **quietness and confidence***,* unlike their frantic negotiations with Egypt.\n\n
30:16	idm86046					 Judah’s reliance on Egypt to supply **swift horses** (see *Ps 33:17*) amounted to a rejection of God’s help and threatened to bring about its fall.\n\n
30:17	idm86054					 **One . . . Five:** This curse is the opposite of God’s blessing for obedience (*Lev 26:8*; *Deut 32:30*). • The Assyrians had dominated the rest of the land of Judah, leaving Jerusalem isolated **like a lonely flagpole on a hill.**\n\n
30:18	idm86064					 This prophecy of salvation includes promises that directed Israel’s attention away from their present adversity to the glorious future awaiting the children of God.\n\n
30:18	idm86070					 **A faithful God** would restore righteous order to the world by punishing the wicked and rescuing his people from them (see *1:27*; *Ps 96:10-12*). • God blesses **those who wait;** faithful people do not rush ahead of him to solve their own problems but instead rely on his power and goodness.\n\n
30:19	idm86080					 This was probably a challenge and promise to Hezekiah during the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem (see chs *36–37*). If he would just trust in God, his people would **weep no more**. • The Lord cares for the needs of his people; when they **ask** for something, he will **surely respond**.\n\n
30:20	idm86090					 **adversity for food and suffering for drink:** A city under enemy siege for a long time would eventually be overcome by starvation and disease. God did not intend that this disaster should destroy the people of Jerusalem, rather that it would be a tool to **teach** them.\n\n
30:21	idm86098					 The people’s **own ears will hear** and follow God’s instructions (see *6:9-10*; *29:18*; *35:5*).\n\n
30:22	idm86108					 One aspect of Hezekiah’s reforms was to remove **silver idols** and other idolatry of Ahaz’s era and to call the people back to the worship of the God of Israel (*2 Kgs 18:4-5*; *2 Chr 29*).\n\n
30:23	idm86117					 The people of Judah would again enjoy covenant blessings rather than curses (see *Lev 26:4*).\n\n
30:26	idm86124					 The Lord who struck his people would also **heal** them **and cure the wounds he gave them**.\n\n
30:27	idm86132					 In this prophecy of judgment against the nations, Isaiah foretold that Assyria’s power would be broken by God’s strong arm, not by the Egyptians.\n\n
30:28	idm86138					 **like a flood up to the neck:** Assyria’s destruction would be as devastating as their invasion of Judah (see *8:8*).\n\n
30:30	idm86146					 **His mighty arm** presents an image of strength that echoes God’s victory over the Egyptians in the Exodus (*63:12*; see *Exod 15:6*). • **devouring flames . . . huge hailstones:** Such phenomena are associated with God’s appearance in a theophany (see *study note on Isa 5:25*).\n\n
30:31	idm86157					 **royal scepter:** The Lord, the true King, would be victorious over the threatening Assyrian king.\n\n
30:32	idm86164					 **tambourines and harps:** Instruments formerly silenced in judgment (*24:8*) would again be used by God’s people; this time, the people would celebrate the Lord’s goodness rather than becoming spiritually complacent (see *5:12*).\n\n
30:33	idm86173					 **Topheth** was a pagan altar in the valley of Ben-Hinnom outside Jerusalem where child sacrifices were offered to the Ammonite god Molech by **burning** (*2 Kgs 23:9-10*).\n\n
31:1	idm86182					 Isaiah delivered another vision regarding Judah’s negotiations with Egypt, which probably took place in 705–701 BC. During that time, the conquering Assyrians were on the move, threatening Judah. At first, Hezekiah tried political and military means to avert being totally conquered (see *2 Kgs 18:13-16*).\n\n
31:1	idm86190					 **What sorrow:** This is the fifth of the six woes (see *study note on 28:1–33:24*). • **Looking to the** Lord implies seeking his guidance with a worshipful attitude (see *Deut 4:29*; *Ps 105:3-4*).\n\n
31:4	idm86202					 This prophecy concerned God’s protection of Jerusalem and its rescue from the Assyrians.\n\n
31:9	idm86208					 **princes will flee:** This was fulfilled when Sennacherib fled to Nineveh after God destroyed 185,000 troops (see *37:36-37*). • God himself was the **fire** or **flame** that would devour Assyria.\n\n
32:1	idm86218					 **a righteous king:** The Messiah (*11:1*); the emphasis now is on righteous and wise leadership (*Prov 8:20*). • In Isaiah’s day, **honest princes** were few and far between (see *Isa 3:1-6*; *28:7-19*).\n\n
32:2	idm86230					 **like a shelter . . . a refuge:** The same words were also used to describe God’s protection (*25:4*) and his provision of life-giving water (*41:18*; *43:19-20*). The leaders would serve as God’s agents in blessing his people.\n\n
32:5	idm86240					 Only foolish people value **fools** and **scoundrels** as **heroes** (see also *19:11*, *13*; *32:6-8*).\n\n
32:6	idm86252					 Because they do not care about God’s standards of justice and righteousness, fools have no regard for those who are **hungry** or **thirsty** (see *1:17*; *58:7*, *10*).\n\n
32:7	idm86263					 **smooth tricks . . . crooked schemes:** See *Prov 6:12*, *18*; *16:27*; *24:8-9*.\n\n
32:9	idm86274					 This prophecy of judgment was against the complacent women of Jerusalem. God’s promises regarding the future did not justify continuing in sin.\n\n
32:9	idm86280					 The women of Jerusalem **lie around in ease.** Complacent in their high standard of life and low standard of morality, they put their trust in wealth and status to maintain their way of life.\n\n
32:10	idm86287					 **In a short time:** Assyria’s siege of Jerusalem (701 BC) was looming.\n\n
32:11	idm86295					 **Burlap** was worn **to show . . . grief***,* especially when mourning (see *Ps 30:11*). The Assyrian conquest of the farmlands of Judah and most of its cities (except Jerusalem) would cause rich people in the large cities to mourn.\n\n
32:14	idm86305					 Jerusalem was eventually destroyed, but by the Babylonians, not the Assyrians (for a prediction of this, see *39:1-8*).\n\n
32:15	idm86312					 The **Spirit** would transform the nation into a godly community and bring in an era of justice and righteousness (see also *Joel 2:28-32*). The Spirit is connected to the Messiah (*Isa 11:1*) and the servant (*42:1*; *61:1*). • **wilderness . . . bountiful crops:** When the people are transformed, nature will be too.\n\n
32:17	idm86324					 Being right with God and humans **will bring peace** (Hebrew *shalom;* see *26:3*; *48:18*; *52:7*; cp. *Jas 3:18*). Peace is more than the absence of conflict. It includes personal wholeness and does not depend on outside circumstances (see also *Rom 5:1*).\n\n
32:18	idm86337					 Living **in safety** and feeling **at rest** were blessings of Israel’s covenant with the Lord (see *Lev 26:5-6*), but the people’s sin had previously brought curses rather than blessings (cp. *Isa 32:9-11*).\n\n
32:19	idm86347					 **the forest . . . the city:** The godly would remain secure even with evidence of God’s judgment all around them.\n\n
33:1	idm86354					 This was the sixth threat of woe (see *study note on 28:1–33:24*). • Although the Hebrew text does not specifically name Assyria as the object of the prophecy in this chapter, Isaiah undoubtedly had Assyria in mind; they were the *destroyer* most immediately at hand when the prophecy was written. The prophecy applies, however, to any who seek to destroy God’s people; this included, but was not limited to, the Babylonians (see chs *13–14*). • **When you are done betraying:** Wicked nations often break political agreements with other nations when these contracts are no longer to their own advantage.\n\n
33:2	idm86364					 The godly community prayed for God to **be merciful** in response to the promise of *30:18*.\n\n
33:9	idm86372					 **Sharon, Bashan,** and **Carmel** were all fertile areas. Their desolation represents the destruction Assyria had inflicted on **Israel**.\n\n
33:11	idm86381					 In most passages, the **Assyrians** were turning other nations into worthless **dry grass and stubble** (see *17:13*; *29:5*; *40:24*; *41:2*). Here, ironically, they get a taste of their own medicine.\n\n
33:14	idm86393					 **The godless** were people who lived without regard for God and his law. • The image of a **devouring fire** came from God’s judgment of offenders during the wilderness journey (*Exod 24:17*; *Deut 4:24*). God still expects people to worship him with reverence and awe (*Heb 12:29*).\n\n
33:15	idm86404					 A godly life provides evidence that an individual truly knows God (see *Col 3:5-17*; *Jas 2:14-18*; *1 Pet 1:14-16*; *1 Jn 1:5-6*).\n\n
33:17	idm86414					 This vision is about God’s reign in Zion.\n\n
33:17	idm86420					 **The king** is the human representative (*32:1*) of the Great King, God himself (*33:22*). • The **land** belonging to God’s people would appear to be without borders because the foreign enemies had been judged (*54:3*).\n\n
33:18	idm86431					 **Assyrian officers** brought great terror to Judah when the Assyrians defeated various cities around Jerusalem (*2 Kgs 18:13*).\n\n
33:19	idm86439					 The **strange, unknown language** was the tongue of Assyria and later of Babylon (see *28:11*).\n\n
33:24	idm86447					 **The people of Israel** were the people of Zion (cp. *33:20*). • **sick . . . the** Lord** will forgive their sins:** See *43:25*.\n\n
34:1	idm86459					 This prophecy of judgment was against the nations at the terrifying day of the Lord (see *study note on 2:5-22*; see also *63:1-6*).\n\n
34:2	idm86467					 **completely destroy:** See *Lev 27:28-29*.\n\n
34:3	idm86475					 It was a disgrace for a corpse to remain **unburied**.\n\n
34:4	idm86482					 **The heavens . . . stars:** See also *13:10*; *Joel 2:30-31*; *Matt 24:29*; *Mark 13:24-25*; *2 Pet 3:10-13*; *Rev 6:13-14*.\n\n
34:5	idm86495					 **Edom** here represents what all the nations would experience, just as Moab was singled out in ch *25*.\n\n
34:6	idm86503					 **Bozrah** was a city in Edom, southeast of the Dead Sea.\n\n
34:8	idm86510					 **The** Lord**’s revenge** refers to God’s wrathful but righteous vengeance against his enemies and the oppressors of his people on the day of the Lord. • **Edom will be paid back:** There will be retribution for Edom’s crimes against Judah (see also *Ps 137:7*; *Lam 4:21*; Obad; *Mal 1:3-5*). Edom, with its history of treachery, would come to an end.\n\n
34:9	idm86523					 Edom’s judgment was similar to the judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah (*Gen 19:24*; see also *Jer 49:17-18*).\n\n
34:10	idm86531					 See also *Rev 14:11*; *19:3*.\n\n
34:11	idm86539					 Wild animals, night birds, and hostile plants with **thorns** and **nettles** created an eerie environment.\n\n
34:16	idm86547					 **Search the book of the** Lord**:** Isaiah’s prophecy was God’s witness to the truthfulness of his word. • The power of the **Spirit** enacts the Lord’s decrees, assuring that all prophecy comes together to be fulfilled as God promised.\n\n
34:11	idm86557					 The identification of some of these birds is uncertain, but they inhabited wild and deserted places and many were considered unclean (*Deut 14:11-18*).\n\n
35:1	idm86564					 God will come to vindicate and transform his people. Instead of being deaf, blind, and lame (see *6:10*), the people will be pure, holy, and redeemed.\n\n
35:1	idm86571					 God’s land would become like a **wasteland,** spiritually desolate and physically depleted. However, God would turn the desert into a garden (see also *32:15*), taking his people from exile to glory.\n\n
35:2	idm86579					 **Lebanon . . . Mount Carmel . . . Sharon:** There will be a reversal of earlier judgments (see *2:13*; *10:34*; *29:17*; *33:9*). • **glory . . . splendor of our God:** See also *6:3*; *40:5*.\n\n
35:3	idm86593					 **Tired hands** and **weak knees** express discouragement and anxiety (see *Heb 12:12*).\n\n
35:4	idm86602					 **do not fear:** The Lord here assures his people of his presence and purpose (see also *7:4*; *10:24*; *40:9*; *43:1*; *44:2*; *54:4*). • The essence of the good news is that **God is coming** to save his people (see also *40:9*; *52:7*; *62:11*). God’s coming brings spiritual transformation as well as rescue from **enemies**.\n\n
35:5	idm86620					 **eyes . . . ears:** There will be a transformation from spiritual blindness and deafness to understanding and knowing God (*6:10*; *29:18*; *32:3*; *42:7*; see also *Luke 7:22*; *Acts 26:18*).\n\n
35:6	idm86633					 The **lame . . . those who cannot speak:** All disabilities will be removed (see *Matt 11:5*; *12:22*; *Mark 7:37*; *Acts 3:7-8*).\n\n
35:8	idm86644					 The imagery of the **great road** recalls Israel’s crossing through the Red Sea (*51:10*). • Only holy and undefiled people will share **the Highway of Holiness**. God’s goal in salvation is that humans will share in his character and act as he does (see *Eph 5:1-2*; *1 Pet 2:21*).\n\n
35:10	idm86655					 **Jerusalem:** The prophecy extends beyond the return of Israel from exile to the final establishment of God’s kingdom on earth. It will be characterized by **joy and gladness** and the absence of **sorrow and mourning** (see also *25:7*; *51:11*; *Rev 21:4*).\n\n
36:1	idm86667					 Jerusalem’s rescue from King Sennacherib of Assyria is a focal point of chs *1–39*. The Lord promised to rescue his people by remaining present with Jerusalem (see *7:14*) and by maintaining a remnant (see *study note on 10:20*). Even though much of the country was desolate and the population decimated because of their foolish alliance with Assyria (chs *7–8*), the Lord preserved his people from total conquest through Hezekiah, a godly king. Hezekiah faced the same test that Ahaz did, a test of trust (note the recurrence of words for *trust* in the Assyrian officer’s challenge in ch *36*). But Hezekiah has learned the lessons taught in chs *13–35* and, at least initially, he passed the test. This narrative is duplicated in *2 Kgs 18:13–20:19*.\n\n
36:1	idm86681					 **King Sennacherib of Assyria** ruled from 705–681 BC. Hezekiah, like many other kings under Assyrian vassalage, had reasserted his independence when Sennacherib came to the throne in troubled circumstances. By 701 BC, the Assyrian king was ready to punish Hezekiah. Sennacherib recorded having **conquered** forty-six fortified cities and many villages, and having taken 200,146 captives. Hezekiah responded by attempting to appease Sennacherib (see *2 Kgs 18:14-16*), but it was too late.\n\n
36:2	idm86692					 **Lachish** was a city overlooking the low-lying hills to the west of Jerusalem. It had to be taken before the final attack on Jerusalem could be launched. • **the aqueduct that feeds water into the upper pool:** This was a pool on the north side of Jerusalem, not the Gihon Spring in the Kidron valley. • Isaiah had met Ahaz on this same **road leading to the field where cloth is washed** some thirty-three years earlier (see *Isa 7:3*). At that time he had challenged Ahaz to trust God. However, Ahaz trusted Assyria instead, and this desperate situation was a result. Now the challenge to trust God came from mocking, foreign lips (see *28:11-13*).\n\n
36:3	idm86703					 **Eliakim** eventually advanced in rank, while **Shebna** was demoted (see *22:15-24*).\n\n
36:4	idm86712					 The Assyrian chief of staff attempted to use intimidation to negotiate a settlement without bloodshed. In his first speech (*36:4-10*), he rightly argued against Egypt’s ability to rescue but wrongly charged Hezekiah with misplaced trust in the Lord. Strikingly, the Assyrian did not see the contest as being between the gods of Assyria and the Lord but rather between Sennacherib—**the great king**—and the Lord.\n\n
36:4	idm86720					 **Great king** is a title similar to *emperor.*\n\n
36:5	idm86728					 **Who are you counting on:** Judah had asked Egypt to help them (see *30:1-5*).\n\n
36:6	idm86736					 **Egypt . . . is completely unreliable:** Isaiah argued the same case, pointing to the Lord as the only reliable source of help (*31:1-3*, *7*; *39:7*). • A kind of **reed** that breaks easily grows near the Nile (see *Ezek 29:6-7*).\n\n
36:7	idm86748					 **We are trusting in the** Lord** our God:** Ironically, the Assyrian chief of staff knew about and played on Isaiah’s message (*26:4*; *36:15*; *37:10*). • Hezekiah showed his zeal for the Lord by tearing **down** the pagan **shrines and altars** (*2 Kgs 18:4*), but the Assyrians mistakenly thought Hezekiah had angered God in the process.\n\n
36:8	idm86763					 At this time, cavalry mounted on **horses** was the newest military technology. The Assyrian chief of staff was mocking the Judeans because he knew that Judah had no trained **men** who knew how **to ride**.\n\n
36:10	idm86772					 **The** Lord** himself told us:** It was common for a king to claim the approval of a deity in destroying other kingdoms. This claim was consistent with Isaiah’s prophecy in *10:5-6*.\n\n
36:11	idm86782					 **Aramaic** was the lingua franca used throughout the Assyrian Empire, understood by the elite but not by the common people of Judah.\n\n
36:13	idm86789					 In the Assyrian chief of staff’s second speech, he claimed that his nation’s gods were more powerful than the God of Judah (cp. *10:9-10*). God’s ability to rescue his people was at stake. In the ensuing drama, the Lord shocked the Assyrian with his power (*37:36-37*).\n\n
36:14	idm86797					 **Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you:** This public accusation against Hezekiah was intended to undermine the people’s confidence in him.\n\n
36:15	idm86804					 Hezekiah demonstrated a strong faith **in the** Lord**,** unlike Ahaz (ch *7*). Hezekiah’s faith would bring **rescue***,* whereas Ahaz’s lack of faith brought him trouble (see *7:9*).\n\n
36:16	idm86817					 The Assyrian was tempting the people of Jerusalem with provisions that the Lord had promised to provide his obedient people (see *1:19*; *37:30-35*; *Deut 8:7-9*). It was a tempting offer, but a counterfeit. And it covered up the reality of exile that would have followed (*Isa 36:17*).\n\n
36:19	idm86827					 The populations of **Hamath and** **Arpad** had been relocated to Samaria, where the new local deities were **the gods of Sepharvaim** (*2 Kgs 17:24*). The logic of the argument made sense to an Assyrian. If the Assyrian gods defeated all the gods of the other nations and the God of the Israelite nation of Samaria, would they not also defeat the God of Judah?\n\n
37:1	idm86837					 Hezekiah responded to the threats by seeking the Lord’s favor. • The king **tore his clothes and put on burlap** as a sign of mourning and prayer.\n\n
37:4	idm86844					 **perhaps . . . God has heard the Assyrian chief of staff** . . . **defy the living God:** Hezekiah’s hope was not based on Judah’s or his own goodness, or the presence of the Temple in Jerusalem; instead, it was based on God responding to Assyria’s blasphemy.\n\n
37:5	idm86852					 God answered that he would deal with the Assyrians and rescue the remnant of his people from their distress (see *63:9*).\n\n
37:8	idm86859					 **Libnah** was a city on the Philistine plain near Lachish. Sennacherib was preparing to fight both Egypt and Jerusalem when he sent word to Hezekiah.\n\n
37:9	idm86866					 **King Tirhakah of Ethiopia** was then the ruler of Egypt.\n\n
37:12	idm86873					 The argument was that Judah’s god, like **the gods of other nations** already conquered by Assyria, would be unable to save Judah (see also *36:18-20*). • **Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, . . . Eden,** and **Tel-assar** were cities in Mesopotamia.\n\n
37:14	idm86883					 When he received Sennacherib’s boastful threat, Hezekiah returned to the Temple and prayed for rescue. His prayer stands in contrast to Ahaz’s response to danger decades earlier (see ch *7*).\n\n
37:16	idm86890					 **God of Israel:** Hezekiah was not taken in by the false claims of Sennacherib that the Lord was powerless. In his prayer, Hezekiah acknowledged that, because the Lord is the Creator, he is **God of all the kingdoms of the earth**. The Lord is sovereign over all kingdoms. • The **mighty cherubim** were located in the Temple atop the Ark of the Covenant, which was God’s throne in his Temple (see *study note on Lev 16:2*; see also *Pss 80:1*; *99:1*).\n\n
37:20	idm86902					 **you alone, O** Lord**, are God:** Hezekiah was concerned for the Lord’s reputation, which Sennacherib had impugned. Hezekiah recognized that if the Lord defeated the Assyrians and their gods, his holy name would be glorified among all the nations of the world (cp. *Exod 9:16*; *14:4*, *17-18*; *Josh 2:9-11*; *1 Sam 4:7-8*).\n\n
37:21	idm86916					 **Because you prayed:** Prayer is powerful; it moved God’s heart and was part of the reason why the Lord answered with this message of hope.\n\n
37:22	idm86923					 **The virgin daughter of Zion:** Jerusalem is personified as a young woman who mocks the Assyrian king (see also *3:26*).\n\n
37:23	idm86931					 **Whom . . . Against whom:** Sennacherib’s speech was not so much an insult against Judah as it was against the Lord.\n\n
37:24	idm86938					 Isaiah seems to be familiar with the typical royal Assyrian boasts, including that they possessed **the highest mountains.** These words sound very much like those found in the annals of the Assyrian kings inscribed on the walls of their temples.\n\n
37:25	idm86945					 **I have dug wells . . . I stopped up all the rivers of Egypt:** Sennacherib’s boasts demonstrate his attitude of independence. However, the Lord alone is sovereign over nature (*42:15*; *43:19*; *44:27*).\n\n
37:26	idm86955					 **I planned for you to crush . . . into heaps of rubble:** Assyria was God’s agent of destruction, but the Assyrians did not realize that they were only a tool in God’s hand (see ch *10*), fulfilling what God had planned long before (*14:24-27*).\n\n
37:28	idm86964					 **you have raged against me:** Assyria was utterly hostile to the Lord, which brought them even greater condemnation.\n\n
37:29	idm86971					 **my hook . . . my bit:** The Assyrians would be led away like animals, just as they had led so many of their captives away.\n\n
37:30	idm86978					 In this prophecy of salvation, Isaiah assured Hezekiah that Jerusalem would be spared and that the remnant was under God’s protection. The names of Isaiah and his sons anticipated God’s rescue (see *7:1–11:16*). The book’s record of God’s presence and rescue provided assurance that the Lord would always have a remnant that he will protect and rescue.\n\n
37:30	idm86985					 **This year . . . next year . . . the third year:** Because of the Assyrian siege and its destruction of agriculture, the people of Judah would not be able to plant and harvest as usual. The promise that life would resume after the siege assured them that God was with them and would provide as they carried out their everyday activities. They needed to develop their trust in God over a period of three calendar years in the confident expectation that God’s word would be true (cp. *30:15*, *18*). Perhaps the point was that after rescue from the Assyrians, it would be too late in the present year for fall planting. They would have to wait until fall in the second year to plant again, and they would reap their first crop in the spring and summer of the third year.\n\n
37:32	idm86994					 **The passionate commitment** of God includes his energetic zeal to keep his promise, the best guarantee his people could ever have (see also *9:7*).\n\n
37:33	idm87002					 **armies . . . arrow . . . shields . . . banks of earth:** Despite their advanced military technology and great power, the Assyrians would not succeed against Jerusalem.\n\n
37:35	idm87009					 **for the sake of my servant David:** God had promised David a perpetual dynasty (see *9:6-7*; *2 Sam 7:8-17*).\n\n
37:36	idm87018					 **The angel of the** Lord was a special heavenly agent through whom God worked on earth. Often his role was to communicate special messages (see *Gen 16:7-14*), but sometimes he brought judgment (see *2 Sam 24:16*). • **killed 185,000 Assyrian soldiers:** The Lord began to fulfill what he had repeatedly promised—rescue of Jerusalem and judgment of Assyria (see *Isa 10:16*, *33-34*; *30:31*; *31:8*).\n\n
37:38	idm87033					 **One day:** Sennacherib was probably killed in 681 BC, about twenty years after his withdrawal from Jerusalem. • **Esarhaddon** was king of Assyria from 680–669 BC. It is ironic that Sennacherib, who mocked the Lord, was killed by his sons in **the temple of his god**.\n\n
38:1	idm87044					 The story of Hezekiah’s healing connects Hezekiah’s extension of life with Jerusalem’s relief from the Assyrians. The events of this story took place before Jerusalem’s rescue from the Assyrians but were placed in a thematic rather than chronological order. One theme is the importance of prayer (see *37:14-20*; *38:2-3*). The Lord does listen! Hezekiah had learned the lesson of trust that his father, Ahaz, refused. As a result, Judah and Jerusalem were spared total destruction by the Assyrians. Yet Hezekiah was not the Messiah, the Son of David promised in *7:14*; *9:1-7*; *11:1-16*; *16:5*; *32:1*, *and 33:17-22*. Thus, these accounts of his failure and mortality (chs *38–39*) prepare the reader for the revelation of the true Messiah that follows (chs *40–66*).\n\n
38:1	idm87060					 **About that time** (literally *in those days*): This is a very general time statement. Hezekiah’s illness and subsequent healing probably preceded Jerusalem’s rescue (chs *36–37*), even though Isaiah places it afterward. Merodach-baladan’s reign in Babylon (*39:1*) ended before Sennacherib’s invasion in 701 BC. The order in the text indicates a connection between these two events (see *38:6*).\n\n
38:3	idm87072					 **I have always been faithful to you:** Hezekiah’s heart was right with the Lord for most of his reign (*2 Kgs 18:1-5*), although his dependence on Egypt was a time of weakness when he did not act faithfully (*Isa 31:1-9*).\n\n
38:5	idm87081					 **the God of your ancestor David:** Hezekiah faithfully walked in David’s footsteps (see *37:35*; *38:1-22*).\n\n
38:6	idm87090					 **I will rescue you . . . I will defend this city:** This promise refers to the rescue of Jerusalem (chs *36–37*); it also provides a greater context for understanding Hezekiah’s sickness and healing. Just as Hezekiah received another fifteen years, Jerusalem also received a temporary reprieve (see ch *39*).\n\n
38:9	idm87099					 Hezekiah’s poem contains both lament (*38:9-14*) and praise (*38:15-20*), although the praise is distinctly muted until the final verse.\n\n
38:10	idm87107					 **enter the place of the dead?** (literally *enter the gates of Sheol?*): This image comes from an ancient idea that people enter death through gates (see *14:9*). Old Testament believers did not understand the afterlife as the New Testament reveals it. It was a shadowy place where all the dead were together and where no praise of God existed (see *38:18*; *Pss 88:10*; *115:17*).\n\n
38:11	idm87119					 Hezekiah lamented that if he died, he would not enjoy fellowship with God, his family, and his friends.\n\n
38:12	idm87125					 These images depicted the brevity of life (cp. *2 Cor 5:1*).\n\n
38:15	idm87132					 **I will walk humbly:** Hezekiah might have previously taken his life and good health for granted. Now he recognized that these gifts from the Lord can be withdrawn at any time.\n\n
38:16	idm87139					 God’s restoration of Hezekiah’s **health** also symbolized the restoration from exile that Judah would experience in the future.\n\n
38:21	idm87146					 Hezekiah received a sign, reminiscent of another sign the prophet had offered Ahaz (*7:11*). Ahaz and Hezekiah were two bookends to a long story. Ahaz represented the ungodly king and Hezekiah the godly king. The former brought disaster on his people, while the latter rescued his people (but see ch *39*).\n\n
38:22	idm87154					 Hezekiah could not **go to the Temple** with an infection (see *Lev 13*), so going to the Temple signifies restored health.\n\n
39:1	idm87162					 Hezekiah was exemplary in godliness, prayer, and care for the people of Jerusalem. But he failed the Lord by parading his financial and military strength before the envoys from Babylon.\n\n
39:1	idm87168					 **Merodach-baladan***,* the king of Babylon (722–710 and 704–703 BC), planned to rebel against Assyria and sought help from Hezekiah. His envoys visited after **Hezekiah had been very sick** and had recovered but before Sennacherib’s final attack in 701 BC.\n\n
39:2	idm87179					 **silver . . . aromatic oils . . . his armory:** Showing these treasures demonstrated to Babylon’s envoys that Hezekiah had the resources to be a worthy ally.\n\n
39:6	idm87186					 **carried off to Babylon:** This prophecy was given before the prophecy of the rescue of Jerusalem (*37:35*). Although this pronouncement of judgment and exile comes as a surprise ending to the story of Hezekiah, the exile of both Israel and Judah had been in the background from the beginning (*10:3-4*, *20-23*). The Lord had promised that he would spare Judah and Jerusalem when the Assyrians attacked in 701 BC, but he had clearly revealed to Isaiah that worse things would come if they did not change their ways. God had demonstrated the truth of his sovereignty and trustworthiness in his defeat of the Assyrians, but that did not mean the people had changed. The only way the promises of *2:1-5* and *4:2-6* were going to be realized was through the fires of judgment (*4:4*). Until the burning coal of exile was applied to the nation’s unclean lips (*6:5-7*), their mission to the nations would fail.\n\n
40:1	idm87201					 The rest of Isaiah provides a message of comfort and a revelation of God’s character and his purposes for Israel. As *39:6-7* predicted, Judah would experience judgment and exile after the time of Isaiah. Throughout chs *40–66*, Isaiah prophesied from the vantage point of the Exile having already become a reality. Therefore, the Babylonian exile provides the background for understanding these chapters.\n\n
40:1	idm87209					 This section announces the good news of God’s coming salvation. The Lord is coming to vindicate his own and to judge his enemies. Salvation would be accomplished through the arrival, suffering, and exaltation of the Lord’s servant—the Messiah, Jesus Christ.\n\n
40:1	idm87215					 This chapter introduces chs *40–66*. In this section, **comfort** refers to the result of God’s merciful way of dealing with people in the age to come. It includes encouragement, strength, and acceptance. God wants to rescue his people (*40:1-11*) and is more than able to do so (*40:12-26*). The exiles needed to believe God’s promises and wait on him for their rescue (*40:27-31*; see also *30:15-18*).\n\n
40:2	idm87227					 **Speak tenderly:** The prophet’s message was to encourage Jerusalem with the good news of God’s forgiveness, reconciliation, and restoration. • From the prophetic perspective, Israel’s **sad days are gone** because the Exile is over. • **punished her twice over for all her sins:** Israel experienced the full brunt of God’s wrath (*51:19-23*; cp. *61:7*).\n\n
40:3	idm87238					 There is now a shift from the general announcement of the good news to the specific expectation of God’s coming. The good news (*40:1-2*) is grounded in God himself. Isaiah portrayed the Lord as coming on a highway through the desert (see ch *35*), although the imagery is here reversed: In ch *35*, the people were traveling to Zion, toward the Lord. Here, the Lord is coming toward his people (see also *52:8*, where the two images are brought together).\n\n
40:3	idm87248					 **the voice of someone shouting:** In *Mal 3:1* this person (possibly the Elijah of *Mal 4:5*) was God’s messenger who prepared the way for God’s coming. In the Gospels, this announcer was identified with John the Baptist (*Matt 3:3*; *Mark 1:3*; *Luke 3:4*; *John 1:23*). • **Clear the way . . . Make a straight highway:** The announcer’s message would expedite God’s coming (see *Isa 35:8*). As God made a way for Israel through the Red Sea (*43:16*), so a way would be opened up for the Lord (see *52:11-12*).\n\n
40:5	idm87265					 The future revelation of God’s glory would include the return of Judah from exile but would also go beyond it. The New Testament confirmed that the revelation of God’s glory came in Jesus Christ (*John 1:14*; *Heb 1:3*). • **The** Lord** has spoken:** The coming salvation and judgment would certainly occur because the Lord, who keeps his word, had declared it (see *Isa 1:20*; *58:14*).\n\n
40:6	idm87278					 All humanity is mortal and fleeting. By contrast, God persists in his plans and succeeds. Time does not limit him from carrying out his will (see *14:24*).\n\n
40:6	idm87285					 **Shout:** So that all can hear. • **People** are not worthy of the revelation of God’s glory because they are mortal.\n\n
40:7	idm87293					 **The breath of the** Lord refers to God’s spoken words of judgment (see *4:4*).\n\n
40:8	idm87302					 **the word of our God stands forever:** All of God’s words (his plans as well as the written word) will succeed. God might frustrate human expectations, but everything will happen according to his wise plan (see *14:24*; *55:8-11*; see also *Matt 25:34*).\n\n
40:9	idm87312					 God is the good news. Although he comes like a warrior to rescue his people with power, he also holds them tenderly as a shepherd.\n\n
40:9	idm87318					 **God is coming** to save and restore human beings (see also *35:4*; *Rev 22:12*).\n\n
40:10	idm87327					 The Lord’s **rule** is not like that of the unjust and powerless rulers whom he will judge. It is compassionate, just, righteous, and powerful. • **with a powerful arm:** God manifested his power in events such as the defeat of the Egyptians (*63:12*), the judgment of his enemies (*30:30*; *48:14*; *51:9*), and the rescue of his people (*59:16*).\n\n
40:11	idm87340					 Isaiah used the familiar biblical metaphor of a **shepherd** to speak of God’s care for his people (see also *49:10*; *Ps 23:1*; *Jer 3:15*; *23:4*; *Ezek 34:11-17*; *Matt 2:6*; *John 10:1-18*).\n\n
40:12	idm87354					 Against the backdrop of Israel’s questions (spoken by the prophet), the Lord affirmed that he is the incomparable God, a wise and sovereign creator who rules over the nations.\n\n
40:12	idm87360					 These rhetorical questions evoke the answer “No one!” God alone created all that exists. He will judge creation (*24:17*), and he alone can and will restore creation through his salvation.\n\n
40:15	idm87367					 God is sovereign over **all the nations of the world** and over their human power structures. In comparison to God, they are almost **nothing.** This included the Babylonian Empire, which was merely a tool in God’s hand. • **whole earth:** Literally *coastlands* or *islands.*\n\n
40:16	idm87378					 Lebanon was prized for its abundance of wood and its wildlife (see *2:13-16*; *Ps 104:16-17*).\n\n
40:17	idm87386					 The nations, including their leaders (*40:23*), pagan structures (*41:24*, *29*; *44:9-11*), and all enemies of God’s people (*41:11-12*), are **worth nothing** apart from God.\n\n
40:18	idm87398					 **To whom . . . What image:** Earlier in the book, idolatry was shown to be ridiculous (*16:12*; *37:16-19*). Chapters *40–48* open up a much more extensive argument against idolatry. Idols are symbolic representations of gods and, at times, other religious concepts. Those who worship them don’t recognize the implication that they are man-made trinkets. Idols are powerless (*41:7*, *22-24*; *48:14*), give a false sense of security (*42:17*), delude people (*44:20*), and lead to severe disappointment (*42:17*; *45:16*, *20*). They cannot help those who care for them. In fact, they are so weak that they fall down (*40:20*; *41:7*). In the end, idols compete for God’s glory (*42:8*) and take away human dignity (*44:9*; see also *41:21-29*). • The Lord, the true God, is incomparable (see *40:25*; *46:5*; *Pss 86:8*; *89:6*); no one could **resemble him**.\n\n
40:20	idm87426					 **image that won’t fall down:** This is a sarcastic remark; it would be embarrassing if the idol did not even have the power to remain standing (see *40:18*; *41:7*; *1 Sam 5:4*).\n\n
40:21	idm87436					 Idolaters fail to discern who God is or to respond wisely to him. The godly in Israel would **understand** and see the hand of God in the unfolding story of redemption, which includes both exile and restoration (*41:20*).\n\n
40:22	idm87444					 **God sits** enthroned as King over all **the earth** (see *6:1*; *Pss 2:4*; *80:1*; *99:1*; *102:12*; *113:5*). God is so immense and awesome that humans are **like grasshoppers** in comparison. • Belief in God as creator of **the heavens** and earth contradicts the popular Babylonian and Egyptian belief that the sun, moon, and stars represent gods. • **like a curtain . . . his tent:** See also *Ps 104:2*.\n\n
40:23	idm87462					 **great people:** God is unimpressed by human power and fame.\n\n
40:25	idm87469					 **The Holy One** is a shortened form of “the Holy One of Israel,” a common designation for God in Isaiah (see also *10:17*; *43:15*; *Ps 22:3*).\n\n
40:26	idm87479					 **Look up into the heavens:** Just as God directed Abraham to look into the sky (*Gen 15:5*), he also directed Israel to look to the stars for encouragement (see also *Isa 51:2-3*). The cosmos bears witness to God’s **great power and incomparable strength**. The Strong One is able to strengthen the weak (*40:27-31*; see *Ps 147:5*).\n\n
40:27	idm87491					 **does not see your troubles . . . ignores your rights:** The coming exile, a period when God’s powerful presence and rescue would not be seen, would prompt questions (see also *49:14*; *54:7*; *Lam 5:20-22*).\n\n
40:28	idm87501					 **heard . . . understood:** Cp. *40:21*. • **the everlasting God, the Creator of all the earth:** Creation reveals God’s power and wisdom. He is also the Creator of the age to come, a world of righteousness, justice, and peace (*45:8*; *48:6-7*; *65:17-18*). • **He never grows weak or weary:** God is not susceptible to human limitations.\n\n
40:29	idm87514					 **The weak** in this context are those who face persecution or oppression (such as the Babylonian exile); the Lord is their only recourse (see *49:4-5*; *50:4*; *Pss 68:9*; *119:28*).\n\n
40:31	idm87525					 **trust in the** Lord**:** See *33:2*; *49:23*; *51:5*. • **like eagles:** This powerful image of rescue reminded readers of the Exodus event of long ago (*Exod 19:4*; *Deut 32:10-12*; see also *Ps 103:5*).\n\n
41:1	idm87541					 The Lord here invited the nations to a trial where he would prove that he alone is God. They were defenseless as he declared that a **king from the east** (*41:2*) would crush Babylon, opening the way for Israel to return.\n\n
41:1	idm87549					 The nations coming together for a trial have to **listen in silence** to the presentation of God’s arguments. • **Bring your strongest arguments:** Literally *let them find new strength,* a play on *40:31*. • God invited the nations to **come . . . and speak***,* challenging them to refute his case.\n\n
41:2	idm87561					 This **king from the east** was Cyrus, the Persian king who conquered Babylon in 539 BC and permitted the Jews to return to their land and rebuild Jerusalem (538 BC; *Ezra 1:1-4*). Isaiah’s prophecies about Cyrus (see *Isa 44:28–45:13*; *48:14-15*) encouraged Israel to look to the Lord as sovereign over all of human history, including the actions of great kings. • **Who gives this man victory over many nations?** As victorious as the conquering Cyrus was, he was still subject to the Lord.\n\n
41:4	idm87574					 **each new generation from the beginning of time:** God is sovereign over all things. From the beginning he has unfolded each stage of history according to his plan. • In the book of Revelation, Jesus identifies himself as the Alpha and the Omega, **the First and the Last***,* the Beginning and the End (*Rev 1:8*, *17*; *2:8*; *21:6*; *22:13*). • **I alone am he:** The Lord alone is God (see also *Isa 43:10*, *13*; *46:4*; *48:12*; *Deut 32:39*). Jesus used similar expressions for himself (see *John 6:35*; *8:12*, *24*; *9:5*; *10:7*, *9*, *11*, *14*; *11:25*; *14:6*; *15:1*, *5*).\n\n
41:5	idm87606					 This taunt against idolatry was a response to God’s raising up of Cyrus; the nations hope to find protection in their idols.\n\n
41:6	idm87612					 **Be strong!** The nations put their hope in things that have no strength, objects made by human craftsmen.\n\n
41:8	idm87619					 These two prophecies of salvation for God’s servant Israel (*41:8-13*, *14-16*) prepare for the first of the suffering servant songs (see *study note on 42:1-4*).\n\n
41:8	idm87628					 The servant—here the nation of Israel—was God’s **chosen one***,* whose calling was grounded in God’s purposes. • **Abraham my friend:** The phrase in Hebrew could mean *Abraham who loves me* or *Abraham* *whom I love.* See also *Jas 2:23*.\n\n
41:9	idm87641					 **I have chosen you** restates *41:8* to emphasize God’s commitment and faithfulness to his people Israel, who had not been faithful to him. • **not throw you away:** Because of the Exile, the people felt that God had rejected them (see *49:21*; *54:6*). However, God had good purposes for them.\n\n
41:10	idm87652					 **I am with you:** The promise of God’s presence (see *7:14*) is central to the Bible. Because God is present, his people do not need to fear (see also *43:1-2*, *5*). • **I am your God:** The Lord used the language of the covenant to affirm that he is their God and that they are his people (see also *Jer 7:23*; *31:1*, *33*; *Ezek 14:11*; *36:28*; *37:27*; *Zech 8:8*). • **hold you . . . my victorious right hand:** The Lord used language reminiscent of the Exodus (cp. *Exod 15:6*) to encourage Israel (see also *Isa 41:13*; *63:12*).\n\n
41:14	idm87674					 In exile, Israel was in a **lowly** state. • God is the **Redeemer.** He works mightily to rescue and restore people from sin and its consequences (for Israel, the Exile; for application to Jesus, see *Luke 2:38*; *21:28*; *Rom 3:24*; *1 Cor 1:30*; *Gal 4:5*; *Eph 1:1-14*; *Titus 2:14*; *Heb 9:12*).\n\n
41:16	idm87690					 When the grain is thrown into **the wind,** the chaff is blown away. Likewise, Israel’s enemies appeared to be strong but would easily be driven off.\n\n
41:18	idm87697					 **rivers . . . fountains . . . pools of water . . . springs:** These images would strike a responsive chord in an agrarian culture. They also suggest that rescue from the Exile would be a second exodus (cp. *Exod 15:27*; *17:6*).\n\n
41:21	idm87706					 This trial scene develops the Lord’s case against idolatry. Idols are nothing but a human creation, whereas God is the Creator of all things. Idols cannot speak, act, accomplish anything, or save their worshipers.\n\n
41:21	idm87712					 **the King of Israel:** See *6:5*; *43:15*; *44:6*.\n\n
41:25	idm87722					 **I have stirred up a leader:** The God who had planned the Exile through Babylon had already planned for Israel’s restoration from exile through Cyrus (see *41:2*; see also *13:17*). • Although Persia is located to the **east,** rough terrain required those traveling to Israel and Judah to enter **from the north.** • **I will give him victory . . . He will trample them:** As Babylon was sent to trample Assyria, so Persia would trample Babylon.\n\n
41:26	idm87734					 Idols and false gods could not predict the future.\n\n
41:27	idm87740					 The **messenger with good news** told of God’s coming to rescue his people (see *40:9*).\n\n
42:1	idm87748					 The **servant** here is not the people Israel (as in *41:8-28* and elsewhere in chs *41–48*; see *49:5-6*) but is a royal figure who accomplishes his mission with care for people, especially for those who are hurting. The passage is the first of four songs about this servant (*42:1-4*; *49:1-13*; *50:4-11*; *52:13–53:12*). He brings in an era of universal justice. For the connection of the servant with Jesus Christ, see *Matt 12:18-21*.\n\n
42:1	idm87763					 **who pleases me:** God used similar language at Jesus’ baptism (*Matt 3:17*). • **I have put my Spirit upon him:** Any leader might be called a servant, but the presence of the Spirit suggests a king of David’s line or a prophet like Moses (see *Num 11:17*, *24-29*). • Establishing **justice** is the responsibility of a king (see *Isa 9:6-7*; *Ps 72:1*). • This king’s mission will be a greater mission **to the nations** than simply governing the small nation of Judah.\n\n
42:2	idm87778					 **shout or raise his voice:** The royal servant will have calm confidence in his message and calling from God (see also *11:1-5*).\n\n
42:3	idm87786					 The royal servant will be gentle with the oppressed and discouraged (see *3:15*; *41:17*).\n\n
42:4	idm87794					 **distant lands:** The nations long for **justice** and for **instruction** on bringing it about. In this regard the servant is like Moses, to whom the law was given. However, the servant is greater in that he extends justice beyond Israel to all the nations.\n\n
42:6	idm87803					 **my people, Israel . . . my covenant with them** (literally *a covenant for the people*): It is also possible that “the people” referred to all the peoples/nations of the earth (see *49:6*). • **light to guide the nations:** See also *51:4*; *Acts 13:47*.\n\n
42:7	idm87815					 The servant will open the **eyes of the** spiritually **blind** (see *6:10*; *29:18*) and **free the** spiritual **captives from** the **prison** of sin, in addition to those who were captive in the Babylonian exile (see *61:1* with *Luke 4:18*).\n\n
42:8	idm87830					 **I am the** Lord**:** As Creator of the world, and as the only one who can bring about the things he predicts, the Lord alone is glorious and worthy of **praise**.\n\n
42:10	idm87840					 The various geographical regions represent the extremes of human habitation. The whole earth is called to praise God for his commitment to redeem humanity. • **Kedar** and** Sela** (*42:11*; see also *16:1*; *21:16-17*) were representative desert sites.\n\n
42:13	idm87851					 **a mighty hero . . . a warrior:** The background of this theme is God’s victory at the Red Sea during the Exodus (*Exod 15:3*). • God will be victorious over **all his enemies** in order to rescue his people (*Isa 51:9*; *63:1-6*; see also *Pss 54:7*; *108:9*; *112:8*).\n\n
42:14	idm87865					 **I have long been silent . . . restrained myself:** Israel had experienced God’s absence in the Exile, which came about because of their idolatrous ways (*57:11-13*; *2 Kgs 17:6-24*). The godly will pray for God’s presence and renewed involvement in their situation (*Isa 64:12*), and the Lord will answer their prayers because of his commitment to their redemption (*62:1*, *6*).\n\n
42:18	idm87877					 The Israelites who refused to listen to what God said and to understand what they saw God doing in history were rendered spiritually **blind** and **deaf** (see *6:9-10*). They had knowledge of the truth through God’s word and the prophets, but their closed minds refused to act upon it.\n\n
42:21	idm87886					 **exalted his glorious law:** God’s word is a witness to his righteous rule (see *1:10*).\n\n
42:22	idm87894					 Throughout its history, Israel’s sin (*42:24*) made Israel **fair game** for foreign oppressors. Many nations, Assyria and Babylon in particular, became instruments God used to pour **out his fury** (*42:25*) on his rebellious people.\n\n
42:25	idm87904					 Generation after generation of Israelites **did not learn their lesson,** even when God disciplined them through military defeat.\n\n
43:1	idm87911					 In this promise of salvation, the Lord addressed his plundered people in the first person.\n\n
43:1	idm87917					 **the** Lord** who created you:** The language of creation (see *study note on 40:28*) was now applied to God’s formation of the nation Israel. • **I have ransomed you:** At the Exodus, when God brought his people out of bondage. Similarly, God planned to bring his people out of exile and back into their land. Ultimately, Jesus gave his life as a ransom for all humanity (*Matt 20:28*; *1 Tim 2:6*; *Heb 9:15*) • **I have called you by name; you are mine:** Despite having faced his wrath, the people of Israel are still God’s chosen people.\n\n
43:2	idm87932					 Conquering forces could be compared to flooding **rivers** (see *8:8*). • **I will be with you:** God is committed to being with his people to protect and care for them (see *7:14*; *41:10*; *43:5*; *45:14*). • Israel experienced God’s judgment as **the fire of oppression** during the Exile.\n\n
43:7	idm87946					 One of God’s purposes in restoring his people was to display his **glory** to the watching world.\n\n
43:8	idm87953					 The Lord here called on Israel, his blind servant, to be his star witness in a mock trial against idols and false gods. Israel knew that the Lord alone is God, and the people had experienced his salvation.\n\n
43:10	idm87959					 **you are my witnesses:** By their very presence in exile, Israel was evidence that God is truly God. He predicted the Exile long beforehand, and now it had come to pass. God alone is the true God because he speaks and acts and controls all of history. Idols and false gods could do none of these things. Israel would later become even greater evidence because God had also predicted their redemption (*43:11-12*).\n\n
43:14	idm87967					 The Lord assured Israel of its coming redemption from Babylon; the redemption would be modeled on Israel’s past redemption from Egypt and would be greater in some ways (*43:18*).\n\n
43:18	idm87974					 God did not want the Israelites to **forget** the exodus from Egypt. However, they needed to look forward in faith to the spectacular event that was about to occur rather than dwelling on the past.\n\n
43:21	idm87981					 One purpose of redemption is to **honor** God through the praises of the redeemed (see *1 Pet 2:9*).\n\n
43:22	idm87989					 Israel’s history of rebellion had led them into crisis after crisis, yet their rebellion was so great that they stubbornly refused **to ask** God for **help**. When they did pray, their wickedness often caused their prayers not to be heard (*1:15*).\n\n
43:25	idm87998					 God **alone** can and does **blot out . . . sins***,* no matter how many or how great (see also *44:22*).\n\n
43:27	idm88008					 **leaders:** God held Israel’s and Judah’s kings especially responsible for leading the nation into sin (see *2 Kgs 21*).\n\n
44:1	idm88016					 The promise of salvation extended the usefulness of sinful Israel to another generation (*44:3*). The past was bleak (see *43:22-28*), but the future would be a glorious new era transformed by the Spirit.\n\n
44:3	idm88024					 The restoration theme is connected with God’s promise to **pour out** the **Spirit** (see also *32:15-17*; *Joel 2:28-32*; *Acts 2:16-18*). • **on your descendants . . . children:** The next generation of Israelites offered hope.\n\n
44:6	idm88036					 This passage uses the form of a trial speech to press God’s argument that disgrace comes to all who trust in idols and false gods.\n\n
44:15	idm88042					 **he uses part of the wood to make a fire . . . he takes the rest of it and makes himself a god to worship:** This description of the process of making an idol drips with sarcasm and ridicule at the stupidity of the foolish idol worshipers (see also *44:19*).\n\n
44:18	idm88050					 **Their minds are shut:** Idol worshipers cannot see the irony in using one part of a log to warm themselves and another part of the same log to be their god.\n\n
44:21	idm88057					 The Lord promised to forgive Israel’s sins.\n\n
44:23	idm88063					 All creation is called to celebrate God’s redemption of Israel (cp. *1:2*).\n\n
44:24	idm88070					 The Lord alone is sovereign over history. He raised up Cyrus of Persia to execute judgment on Babylon and restore Israel to the Holy Land.\n\n
44:25	idm88076					 **False prophets** and **fortune-tellers** used forbidden forms of divination to try to predict the future. Eventually God would expose them as deluded liars (see *3:2*; *9:15*; *47:13*; *Deut 18:10-11*).\n\n
44:27	idm88088					 The sudden depletion of natural resources at times indicates a divine judgment (see *42:15*; cp. *43:20*). Here, however, God’s ability to **dry up** streams with just a word illustrates his power to do what he said he would do through Cyrus of Persia.\n\n
44:28	idm88097					 **He is my shepherd:** Cyrus went beyond simply permitting the Jews to return to their homeland. He facilitated a major restoration project to **rebuild Jerusalem** and **restore the Temple** (see *45:13*; *Ezra 1:2-4*; *6:3-5*).\n\n
45:1	idm88109					 **anointed one:** This designation, commonly reserved for David or the Messiah, is here applied to Cyrus. Cyrus was anointed in the sense that he was selected to fulfill a special mission. This title was never used of any other foreign ruler (cp. *1 Sam 10:1*; *Rom 13:1*). • **whose right hand he will empower:** The Lord would give Cyrus victory over Babylon (see *Isa 43:14*).\n\n
45:3	idm88120					 **so you may know:** Cyrus’s victories provided factual proof that the Lord has the power to fulfill his plans, whereas idols and false gods do not (see *41:21-29*).\n\n
45:4	idm88128					 **I call you by name:** Cyrus did not **know** the Lord, but the Lord knew him. Isaiah predicted the rescuer Cyrus by name 150 years in advance. This prophecy would prove to the exiles that the Lord is indeed God and that he knows the future.\n\n
45:7	idm88136					 **light . . . darkness . . . good times and bad times:** Everything is under God’s control.\n\n
45:9	idm88143					 The Lord confronts those who question his right to use a pagan king to achieve his purposes. He, the Creator, is free and sovereign in his activities. He promised to bring his people back to their land, and he would use anyone he chose to accomplish that purpose.\n\n
45:9	idm88149					 **pot . . . its maker . . . baby . . . its father:** It is ridiculous for a creature to question the wisdom of its creator.\n\n
45:14	idm88156					 **Egyptians . . . Ethiopians . . . Sabeans:** Israel’s restoration would bring them a new sovereignty. Foreign nations would honor God, and because they recognized God’s special blessing on his people, they would also want to honor his people.\n\n
45:17	idm88163					 Israel would never again be **humiliated and disgraced***,* oppressed, harassed, or abused. The finality of these declarations suggests that this promise will be fulfilled at the end of time.\n\n
45:18	idm88171					 Salvation is from the Lord alone. He is the creator, the revealer, and the executor of his will in human history. He promised to establish a new era of salvation and righteousness (see *45:8*). Every human being will submit to God, either willingly or unwillingly (*45:23-24*).\n\n
45:18	idm88179					 Ancient pagan people viewed the world as **a place of empty chaos**. However, God’s purposes are good, and he made the world from the beginning as a place to be **lived in** with him in harmony.\n\n
45:22	idm88187					 **Let all the world look to me:** All humanity needs to seek the Lord, the true God who created all things, while he may be found (*55:6*). • In God there is **salvation***,* the only hope for all of humanity (*45:8*).\n\n
45:23	idm88198					 God’s words are always true. God’s swearing by his **own name** reinforces the certainty that he will **never go back on** his **word** (see also *14:24*; *54:9*; *62:8*; *Heb 6:13*). • **Every knee . . . every tongue:** At the end of time all nations will submit to his authority, whether willingly or unwillingly (see *Rom 14:11*; *1 Cor 15:25-27*; *Phil 2:10-11*).\n\n
45:24	idm88215					 In this context, **the people** are all who turn to the Lord for salvation, even those from foreign nations (*45:22*).\n\n
45:25	idm88223					 **justified:** Literally *righteous* (see also *45:8*, *24*).\n\n
46:1	idm88233					 This taunt was against the self-contradiction of Babylonian religion.\n\n
46:1	idm88239					 *Marduk-bel* was the most important god in the Babylonian pantheon. **Bel** (similar to “Baal”) designated lordship. • **Nebo** (*Nabu,* *Nebu*), the patron deity of Babylonian scribes, was thought to be the son of Marduk-bel. • Instead of being paraded in glory at a Babylonian festival, these gods would be **hauled away on ox carts** and disposed of, rejected by the Babylonian people.\n\n
46:3	idm88251					 Those **who remain in Israel** refers to the remnant that would be left alive after the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. • The Lord, the Creator of humanity, cares for and carries his people (contrast the Babylonian idols that must be **carried** instead). • **since you were born . . . before you were born:** The Lord chose Israel even before they were a nation (see also *49:5*).\n\n
46:8	idm88262					 Many of the exiles would be completely discouraged and not believe the prediction of God’s rescue. God challenged this unbelief.\n\n
46:10	idm88268					 God knows **the future before it even happens***;* he has comprehensive control over all events, and all his acts match his words (*41:4*, *26*). He is the First and the Last (*44:6*; *48:12*).\n\n
46:11	idm88280					 The **swift bird of prey from the east** refers to Cyrus, the Persian king (see *study note on 41:2*).\n\n
46:12	idm88288					 Formerly, Israel cared little for **doing right** (literally *righteousness;* see also *58:2*; *59:9*).\n\n
46:13	idm88298					 The good news for Israel was that God was coming to **set things right** (literally *I will bring my righteousness near;* see *40:9*; *51:5*). • **show my glory to Israel:** Unlike a craftsman who bestows material splendor on an idol (*44:13*), the Lord bestows true dignity on his people.\n\n
47:1	idm88310					 Two conclusions can be drawn from the preceding evidence that the Lord alone is God: (1) Babylon’s great pride is foolishness (*47:1-15*); (2) Israel needs to pay attention to the word of the Lord (*48:1-22*).\n\n
47:1	idm88318					 In this taunt against Babylon, the queen of nations is humiliated, forced to work as a servant girl.\n\n
47:1	idm88324					 To **sit in the dust** was a way of expressing humiliation.\n\n
47:3	idm88331					 God’s **vengeance** against those who oppose him and those who oppress his people (see *34:8*) will bring justice to the world by purging it of wickedness.\n\n
47:5	idm88339					 Babylon’s confidence and arrogance were well known (see *14:13-17*; *Dan 4:30*). All of this nation’s charms, magic, and wisdom were useless against the disaster decreed for it.\n\n
47:6	idm88347					 The people of Israel had provoked God’s wrath, prompting him to use Babylon to punish them. Now wicked Babylon itself would be punished.\n\n
47:8	idm88353					 **I am the only one, and there is no other:** This was a claim to divinity (cp. *45:5*; *47:10*). Only the Lord can make such a claim. For any created thing, including a nation, to utter this is the height of hubris. • To be a **widow** or to **lose** one’s **children** was a disgrace.\n\n
47:9	idm88365					 **Witchcraft and magic** were commonly used in an attempt to ward off evil and to secure a happy future.\n\n
47:10	idm88372					 In this context, **‘wisdom’** and **‘knowledge’** probably refer sarcastically to the pseudo-knowledge gained through occult practices, which actually **led** Babylon away from the truth and into disaster (*47:11*).\n\n
47:12	idm88382					 In the face of calamity, Babylon would turn to occult practices for help, but it would not find help.\n\n
47:13	idm88388					 Babylon was advanced in astronomy, which the **astrologers** and **stargazers** used as a form of divination (see *Dan 2:2*, *10*; *5:7*).\n\n
48:1	idm88399					 The Lord here calls on Israel to forsake her historic rebelliousness and listen to what he says. The Hebrew word translated *listening* is often synonymous with *obeying* or acting upon what is heard.\n\n
48:1	idm88407					 This prophecy is a *disputation,* a speech in which the prophet argues a set of points against his audience.\n\n
48:1	idm88414					 Israel was religious but not truly committed to the Lord. \n\n
48:1	idm88420					 **Jacob . . . Judah:** Although Isaiah’s normal focus was on Judah, here he addressed all the tribes of Israel.\n\n
48:3	idm88427					 The Lord had forewarned Israel of **what was going to happen** in the Exile.\n\n
48:6	idm88434					 Even though Israel had repeatedly failed to believe God’s past predictions, here he revealed **new things** that were **not yet heard.** Specifically, God revealed that Babylon would fall and Israel would be restored.\n\n
48:10	idm88442					 The Exile was a **furnace of suffering** (cp. *Deut 4:20*) through which God **refined** Israel.\n\n
48:11	idm88451					 **I will not let my reputation be tarnished:** Israel’s exile raised questions among the nations about the Lord’s character and reputation. The nations would not have perceived that Israel’s wicked character led to the Exile. Instead they would have viewed it as a failure of Israel’s God to protect his people and their land (see *36:19-20*; *37:12*; *Ezek 36:19-26*).\n\n
48:12	idm88461					 This final trial speech reviews the arguments of chs *40–48* and announces the final conclusion.\n\n
48:14	idm88468					 **chosen Cyrus** (literally *him*) **as his ally:** See *44:28*; *45:1-2*.\n\n
48:15	idm88479					 **I will send him** and **will help him succeed:** Cyrus would humiliate Babylon and liberate Israel (*45:1-4*).\n\n
48:16	idm88488					 **I have told you plainly:** God’s promises are clear, though not always specific as to manner and time. • **now the Sovereign** Lord** and his Spirit have sent me with this message:** The identity of the one who is sent is unclear. Isaiah might be referring to himself as a Spirit-inspired prophet who spoke the very words of God to Israel. The connection with the Spirit suggests that it refers to the promised servant, the Messiah. • The presence of the Spirit assures the servant’s success.\n\n
48:18	idm88498					 **Peace** and **righteousness** will be established when the Kingdom of God comes in its fullness (see *66:12*). • **like a gentle river . . . like waves:** An abundance of comforting peace and overflowing resources of righteousness (cp. *Amos 5:24*) could have been Israel’s if its people had only listened to God.\n\n
48:19	idm88509					 **Your descendants . . . like the sands:** This would fulfill God’s covenant to Abraham (*Gen 22:17*); by contrast, the Israelites were nearly wiped out in the Exile (see *Isa 44:26*).\n\n
48:20	idm88518					 **Leave Babylon:** See also *52:11-12*; *55:12*.\n\n
48:21	idm88527					 **not thirsty . . . rock . . . water gushed:** These reminders of God’s provision in the Exodus provide a fitting summary of what he would do to rescue Israel from captivity in Babylon (see *Num 20:11*).\n\n
48:22	idm88535					 This refrain, **no peace for the wicked** (also *57:21*), continues the sharp divide between the godly and the wicked (see *66:24*). Peace speaks of God’s kingdom, from which the wicked are excluded.\n\n
49:1	idm88544					 God intended to rescue the Israelites from exile. However, the question remained: How could sinful Israel again become the servant of the Holy One? God would make a way for Israel’s sin to be atoned for and their fellowship with him to be restored. That way would be the promised servant, who would come for Israel and for all peoples. This servant was introduced in *42:1-9*, but in this passage he becomes the central focus.\n\n
49:1	idm88551					 This has traditionally been regarded as the second of four suffering servant songs (see *study note on 42:1-4*). The suffering role of the promised servant becomes increasingly clear (see also *50:4-9*; *52:13–53:12*).\n\n
49:1	idm88560					 **distant lands:** The servant’s ministry would extend beyond Israel (see *42:4*, *10*, *12*; *51:5*; *60:9*; *66:19*). • **called me before my birth . . . from within the womb . . . by name:** The promised servant’s prophetic call was similar to the call of Jeremiah (see *Jer 1:5*; see also *Gal 1:15*). It was not a general call but a very specific, personal one (see also *Isa 43:1*; *45:3-4*).\n\n
49:2	idm88578					 **my words of judgment:** The servant’s mission would be prophetic (see *11:4*; *Eph 6:17*; *Heb 4:12*; *Rev 1:16*; *2:12*, *16*; *19:15*).\n\n
49:3	idm88592					 The suffering **servant** would come out of **Israel** (see *41:8*) and would himself be the true Israel. He would serve as both king (*42:1*) and prophet (*49:1*), anointed with the Spirit of God (*61:1*) and commissioned (*48:16*) as a faithful witness to God’s purposes (*43:12*; *48:20*). In his mission toward both Israel and the other nations (*49:6*), he would suffer rejection and disgrace while being faithful, unlike the nation of Israel (see *50:4-9*). His suffering would be on behalf of God’s chosen people. Jesus became the ultimate fulfillment of the suffering servant (see *study note on 52:13–53:12*).\n\n
49:4	idm88610					 **my work seems so useless . . . to no purpose:** Even though people stubbornly refuse his message, the servant would reach out to them. • **I will trust God:** Despite discouragement and suffering, the servant would continue to discharge his duty faithfully, trusting God for the outcome. God promised to **reward** the servant’s faithfulness (see also *40:10*; *50:8*).\n\n
49:6	idm88621					 **a light to the Gentiles:** As the Messiah, the servant’s mission would have a worldwide reach (see *11:10*, *12*; *42:6*). The apostle Paul explained his apostolic mission to the Gentiles on the basis of this prophecy (*Acts 13:47*; *26:23*).\n\n
49:7	idm88633					 The promised servant would be **despised and rejected by the nations** (see *52:14–53:5*) as well as by his own people (see also *50:6-7*; *53:8-9*). • **Kings** and **princes will also bow low** to express respect and humility before the servant (see also *52:15*), whom God will exalt after he has suffered. God is **faithful** to his servant.\n\n
49:8	idm88647					 God acts at **just the right time** to accomplish his purposes (*Acts 1:7*; *2 Cor 6:2*). Israel returned to **reestablish the land of Israel** after the Exile. The land was restored and the city rebuilt beginning with Cyrus’s edict (*Isa 44:26-28*).\n\n
49:10	idm88658					 Like a shepherd, the Lord in his **mercy will lead** the returning exiles **beside cool waters***;* he promised to comfort them and tend to their needs (see also *40:11*; *Ps 23:1*). • **level paths . . . highways:** The Lord would open up the way of salvation.\n\n
49:12	idm88670					 The remnant would come from the **north** (i.e., from Babylon and Persia), from the **west** by sea, and **from as far south as Egypt**.\n\n
49:13	idm88679					 This hymn of praise is in response to the salvation that the servant would make possible.\n\n
49:14	idm88685					 Although the prophet announced cause for rejoicing (*49:8-13*), the exiles continued to ponder the calamity that came upon them when Babylon invaded the land, destroyed **Jerusalem***,* and carried the people of Judah into exile where they felt **deserted** and **forgotten**.\n\n
49:18	idm88696					 **like jewels or bridal ornaments:** As a wedding calls for festivity and public display, so God’s restoration of Israel would be an open act for all to see (see also *61:10*).\n\n
49:19	idm88704					 The population explosion would reach beyond Israel to include the members of foreign nations who turn to the Lord (see *56:6-8*; *Rev 7:9*). • **more room:** The expanded population would require space far beyond the traditional boundaries of the land of Israel (see also *Zech 2:4*).\n\n
49:22	idm88714					 **carry your little sons . . . your daughters:** The mighty rulers of the nations, some of whom had previously killed children in Israel, would aid in their return to Zion (see also *60:3-9*). Elsewhere Isaiah envisioned people of foreign nations streaming to Zion to worship the Lord (see *2:2-4*).\n\n
49:23	idm88723					 **you will know that I am the** Lord**:** The stunning role-reversal—kings and queens serving the lowly exiles upon their return—would reveal God’s power to do the unimaginable (see also *60:16*). • The godly would experience temporary disgrace in the Exile but would not ultimately **be put to shame***,* as the idolaters and ungodly were.\n\n
49:24	idm88735					 **Who can snatch . . . Who can demand:** The people considered it nearly impossible that they would be rescued from their oppressors.\n\n
49:25	idm88742					 The Lord is like a warrior who **will fight** to protect his children, as promised to Abraham (*Gen 12:3*; see also *Isa 54:15*).\n\n
50:1	idm88751					 This disputation shows that God was not forced to give Israel up, and therefore he could take the nation back as his people if he desired.\n\n
50:1	idm88757					 God was not at fault for the people’s problems; it was their sin that brought about their exile (see also *59:1-15*). • Jerusalem—the mother city of Judah (*Ps 87:5-6*)—was destroyed, and the people of Judah were **taken** into exile in 586 BC.\n\n
50:2	idm88767					 **Why didn’t anyone answer:** The people had not responded to God’s repeated call to trust in him and repent of their sins. They were deaf and stubborn (see *6:9-10*; *29:18*; *35:5*; *42:18-19*). • The Lord **came** and **called** the people through the prophets (see also *65:1-3*). • **Is it because I have no power to rescue?** God was fully able to rescue Israel and Judah from the Assyrians and Babylonians, but he first had to deal justly with his people’s sinfulness (see *59:1*). • **speak to the sea and make it dry:** This was an allusion to the parting of the Red Sea during the exodus from Egypt (*Exod 14:21-22*).\n\n
50:3	idm88785					 Phenomena such as **darkness** and the wearing of **clothes of mourning** were associated with the day of the Lord (*13:10*; see *study note on 2:5-22*). The mention of darkness might allude to the plague of darkness in Egypt (*Exod 10:21*).\n\n
50:4	idm88796					 This is the third of four servant songs (see *study note on 42:1-4*). The faithful and suffering servant portrays an ideal Israel; the image was realized in Jesus Christ.\n\n
50:4	idm88803					 The Lord, who never grows weary (*40:28*), sends the servant with good news (see *40:28-31*) to **comfort** those who are **weary** (see *study note on 40:1-31*).\n\n
50:6	idm88814					 **beat me . . . pulled out my beard . . . mockery and spitting:** These connections with the experience of Jesus at his crucifixion are too close to be coincidental—Jesus is the true suffering servant (see *Matt 27:27-31*).\n\n
50:7	idm88822					 Externally, the servant would be **disgraced** and **put to shame***,* but within himself he would calmly await God’s vindication (see *29:22*; *54:4*; *61:7*). • **set my face like a stone:** The servant would be determined to do God’s will (see *Luke 9:51*).\n\n
50:8	idm88836					 **He who gives me justice is near:** God vindicates those who suffer for doing his will. Vindication is an act of God by which he exalts those who have been wrongly disgraced and strikes down the wicked, self-exalted, and arrogant (see also *2 Thes 1:6-9*). • **bring charges . . . my accusers:** Confidence in God’s vindication removes fear and bolsters faith (see *Rom 8:31-34*).\n\n
50:9	idm88846					 **Who will declare me guilty?** The implied answer to this rhetorical question is, “No one!” This answer foreshadows the New Testament understanding of justification (see *Rom 8:31-35*).\n\n
50:10	idm88854					 This is a call for response to the servant’s ministry.\n\n
50:10	idm88860					 The test of whether or not an individual **fears the** Lord is how he or she responds to God’s righteous **servant**. The same idea is present in Jesus’ claim that no one can come to the Father except through him (*John 14:6*). • Those who **trust in the** Lord have great hope for the future (see *Isa 12:2*).\n\n
50:11	idm88873					 **warm yourselves by your own fires:** Spiritually complacent people are unresponsive toward God. Though they have comfort and security now, they **will soon fall down in great torment** (see *66:24*).\n\n
51:1	idm88882					 This prophecy calls for trust in the Lord. Each of its three units begins with the phrase, **Listen to me** (*51:1*, *4*, *7*).\n\n
51:1	idm88892					 **The rock** and **the quarry** represent Abraham and Sarah (*51:2*).\n\n
51:2	idm88901					 **Abraham . . . became a great nation:** The exiled community had decreased in number. They needed to have faith that God could restore them again to a healthy and thriving population.\n\n
51:3	idm88908					 **Eden . . . the garden of the** Lord**:** God’s salvation will one day reestablish conditions like those in which human beings first lived (see *Gen 2–3*).\n\n
51:4	idm88918					 **my law . . . my justice:** The work of the servant will prosper because justice will be the rule in God’s kingdom on earth (see *42:1-4*). • **a light to the nations:** The nations will receive the Lord and his revelation (see also *42:6*; *49:6*; *60:1-3*; *66:19-23*; *Matt 4:15-16*; *Luke 2:32*; *John 1:4-9*; *12:35-50*; *Acts 13:47*).\n\n
51:5	idm88936					 God is **strong** enough to crush his enemies and rescue his people, such as when he rescued Israel in the Exodus (see *51:9*; *Exod 6:6*; *15:16*).\n\n
51:6	idm88946					 **die like flies:** The wicked will die in great multitudes on the day of God’s judgment.\n\n
51:7	idm88953					 **cherish my law in your hearts:** Beyond simply knowing God’s word, the Lord desires for his people to internalize, treasure, and obey it (see also *Ps 37:31*; *Jer 31:33*). • Those who obey the Lord often endure **scorn** and **insults** (see also *Matt 5:10-12*).\n\n
51:9	idm88965					 **Wake up, wake up:** God does not sleep; this prayer is for God to act immediately to save his people (see *52:1*; see especially God’s military garb in *59:17*). • **in the days of old:** The exodus from Egypt was an act of redemption that displayed God’s power as he made **a path of escape** (*51:10*) for his people (see also *11:15*).\n\n
51:13	idm88978					 **you have forgotten the** Lord**:** The Lord will never forget Israel (see *44:21*; *49:15*), so they should not forget him. • The **Creator** of the world also created the nation Israel.\n\n
51:14	idm88990					 The Exile brought such brutal conditions as **imprisonment, starvation, and death**.\n\n
51:15	idm88997					 **I am the** Lord**:** The Lord uses this formula to identify himself as the covenant God and to assure his people of the truth of his word and the reliability of his actions (see *27:3-4*).\n\n
51:16	idm89007					 **my words in your mouth:** The focus shifted back to the servant. • **You are my people:** Israel was the covenant community.\n\n
51:17	idm89015					 The prophet called the people of Israel to be done with their past and to anticipate God’s future for them.\n\n
51:17	idm89021					 **Wake up, wake up:** Israel used these words in a prayer to the Lord (*51:9*). Israel’s problems were not the result of God’s slowness to act; rather, the people were slow to believe God’s promises. • **the cup of the** Lord**’s fury:** The Lord will appropriately measure out his judgment; those who fall under his judgment must figuratively drink from his wrath (see also *Matt 26:39*).\n\n
51:20	idm89033					 **children have fainted:** A sad commentary on Jerusalem’s desolation is provided in *Lamentations 1:13*, *22*; *2:11-12*, *19*.\n\n
51:22	idm89044					 God would be the **Defender** of Israel as he was when Assyria besieged Jerusalem (*38:6*).\n\n
51:23	idm89052					 The **tormentors** were the Babylonians who brought about destruction, war, and famine (*51:19*).\n\n
52:1	idm89060					 This second call to **wake up** (see *51:17*) was in preparation for a glorious future. • **holy city:** The new city would be holy because its citizens would be holy (see *4:3*). • **enter your gates no longer:** Things that are **unclean** will not be permitted to enter the holy city (see *Rev 21:27*).\n\n
52:3	idm89073					 **I sold you into exile . . . Now I can redeem you:** The Lord was fully in control when he gave his people into the hands of their enemies. Likewise, he remained fully in control and could redeem them if he chose to do so.\n\n
52:4	idm89080					 **in Egypt . . . oppressed by Assyria:** The exodus from exile would be like Israel’s past exodus from Egypt.\n\n
52:5	idm89087					 The oppressors would **shout in exultation** because they believed they had conquered not only Israel but also its God. • **My name is blasphemed all day long:** The condition of God’s people affects God’s reputation in the eyes of the watching world (see *37:6*, *23*; *48:11*).\n\n
52:6	idm89098					 Just as God did to Moses before the Exodus (*Exod 3:15*), he **will reveal** himself in the coming rescue from exile.\n\n
52:7	idm89106					 This is a poetic description of God’s promise to rescue his people from the alienation their sin created. The imagery is of a besieged city waiting for word that its hero has defeated the enemy armies. Paul applies these words to the proclamation of the Good News of the Lord Jesus (*Rom 10:15*).\n\n
52:7	idm89113					 **How beautiful on the mountains:** See *Nah 1:15*; *Rom 10:15*. • The **good news** goes beyond proclaiming an end to the Exile; it also points to the **peace and salvation** of the age to come (*Isa 54:13-14*; see *40:9-10*; *41:27*).\n\n
52:8	idm89127					 The **watchmen** were those looking for the news of Zion’s redemption. • **the** Lord** returning to Jerusalem:** The sin of the city’s inhabitants had driven God away.\n\n
52:10	idm89137					 **victory of our God:** The rescue of God’s people from disgrace foreshadows an even greater victory when God will reign victoriously to **the ends of the earth** (note the many similarities with *Ps 98:1-3*).\n\n
52:11	idm89146					 This is an exhortation to leave the captivity of sin (see *48:20* on leaving physical captivity in Babylon). See also *2 Cor 6:17*; *2 Tim 2:19*.\n\n
52:11	idm89155					 Here the imagery of leaving the **unclean** enemy city encourages the people to **purify** themselves by turning away from all known sin. Those who **carry home the sacred objects of the** Lord need to be pure.\n\n
52:12	idm89165					 **not leave in a hurry:** At the time of the Exodus the people had to leave quickly (see *Exod 12:11*, *31-36*). Isaiah drew this contrast to emphasize the newness of God’s plan. • **protect you from behind:** See *Exod 13:21*; *14:19-20*.\n\n
52:13	idm89177					 This is the fourth of four passages that speak about the promised servant (see *study note on 42:1-4*). The Hebrew poem is carefully constructed in five three-line stanzas. It begins with the servant’s exaltation (*52:13*), proceeds to his humiliation (*52:14–53:9*), and ends with his exaltation (*53:10-12*). The faithful servant’s suffering would bring reconciliation between God and humans. The Lord Jesus perfectly fulfilled this prophecy (see ch *40*; *Matt 8:17*; *Acts 8:30-35*; *Rom 10:15-17*; *15:21*; *1 Pet 2:24-25*).\n\n
52:13	idm89193					 **prosper . . . be highly exalted:** The servant would be wise and successful, set apart with the great and noble. Similar terms describe God in *6:1* and *57:15*.\n\n
52:14	idm89202					 Despite the servant’s greatness, the actual way he would appear on earth would shock people.\n\n
52:14	idm89208					 **were amazed:** No one expected that the rescuer would suffer and die.\n\n
52:15	idm89215					 **startle many nations:** They would be amazed that a rescuer would appear so weak and helpless and would **stand speechless.** • What **they will see** and what **they will understand** will be in complete contrast to anything they had previously imagined.\n\n
53:1	idm89225					 **our message:** The identity of the speaker has been debated—the main possibilities are (1) a faithful remnant of Israel, and (2) Isaiah himself. Most likely, Isaiah the prophet was speaking for and with Israel. • **powerful arm:** God’s strength, so dramatically described in the previous chapters (see *50:2*; *51:5*, *9*; *52:10*), would actually manifest itself in weakness and apparent helplessness through the servant’s humiliation and exaltation (see *1 Cor 1:27-30*).\n\n
53:2	idm89238					 **a tender green shoot . . . in dry ground:** Such a plant is vulnerable to extinction (cp. *37:27*). It can hardly stay alive for itself, let alone provide anything for anyone else. • **nothing beautiful or majestic:** The servant appeared to have no greatness or self-evident royal splendor (see *52:13-15*). • **nothing to attract us to him:** People like their leaders to be physically attractive and personally charismatic. The servant would be neither.\n\n
53:3	idm89249					 **a man of sorrows, acquainted with deepest grief** (or *a man of pains, acquainted with illness*): The servant would fully experience the effects of sin and the Fall. • **we did not care:** Because people would fail to see how such a weak, insignificant person could do anything beneficial for them, they would be unconcerned about his suffering.\n\n
53:4	idm89258					 The callous world would assume that the servant somehow brought his suffering on himself, never realizing that he was suffering for them. • **troubles . . . punishment:** These descriptions of the servant’s humiliation contrast with the descriptions of his exaltation.\n\n
53:5	idm89265					 **he was pierced:** See also *Zech 12:10*. • **crushed . . . beaten . . . whipped:** These were typically punishments for crimes. Sin is a crime against God. • **be whole:** Hebrew *shalom,* usually translated “peace.” *Shalom* means to experience wholeness in body, in mind, and in relationships with others. The servant would be injured so that humanity can be whole and healthy in all aspects of life (see also *Isa 57:18*). We do not need to suffer divine condemnation for our sins because the servant has already done so (see *Gal 1:4*).\n\n
53:6	idm89279					 **strayed away . . . left God’s paths:** These are metaphors for sin (see also *Rom 3:10-18*).\n\n
53:7	idm89287					 The Ethiopian eunuch was reading this passage when Philip met him (*Acts 8:32-33*).\n\n
53:7	idm89294					 See *1 Pet 2:21-25* for the fulfillment of this prophecy in Jesus Christ.\n\n
53:8	idm89301					 **Unjustly condemned:** The servant will be given no legal protection or proper defense. • **cut short in midstream:** To die in midlife was understood to be God’s judgment.\n\n
53:9	idm89309					 **no wrong . . . never deceived anyone:** See *1 Pet 2:21-25*. • **in a rich man’s grave:** Literally *he was with the rich in his death* (see *Matt 27:57-61*). Although the Bible often considers riches as a blessing from God, it regularly condemns the rich as crooked and oppressive. The point here might be ironic: This good man would be buried with oppressors.\n\n
53:10	idm89320					 The final stanza of the poem first explains why the servant suffered and was treated unjustly in the place of others; it then explains what the result of that obedience would be.\n\n
53:10	idm89326					 The servant’s **grief** would accomplish a greater good; the forgiveness and reconciliation of sinful humanity. Note also God’s **good plan** to prosper and exalt the servant. • **when his life is made an offering for sin:** The suffering of the servant provided a substitute for others, just as the animal sacrifices in the Temple did. • Having **many descendants** and enjoying a **long life** are rewards for godly and wise living (see *Prov 3:2*; *17:6*; *20:7*). Because the servant left his fate in his God’s hands, he would receive eternal rewards from the God who vindicates the righteous (see *Phil 2:9-11*).\n\n
53:11	idm89341					 **his experience** (literally *his knowledge*): This clearly does not refer to intellectual knowledge but to all that the servant would experience in his obedience, suffering, and intimate relationship with God. • The servant’s **righteous** obedience enables people to be put right with God (see *Gen 15:6*; *Rom 5:18-19*), **for he will bear all their sins**.\n\n
53:12	idm89353					 **the honors:** See *Phil 2:9-11*. • **He was counted among the rebels:** *Rebels* (Hebrew *poshe‘im*) is a stronger word than *sinners* and is a key word in Isaiah. It refers to those who are in willful defiance of a lawful authority, in this case, God. • **interceded for rebels:** The servant would pray for sinners in the midst of his suffering (see *Exod 32:30*; *Luke 23:34*).\n\n
54:1	idm89368					 This is an invitation to participate in the restoration to God’s favor made possible through the ministry of the promised servant.\n\n
54:1	idm89374					 Salvation flows from the vindication of the suffering servant. The promises mentioned here go beyond the return from Babylonian exile and apply to the coming of Jesus Christ, the extension of the kingdom to the church, the benefits of the second coming of Jesus Christ as the bridegroom of the church, and the new Jerusalem.\n\n
54:1	idm89380					 The prophet encourages Jerusalem, likened to a barren woman, to rejoice because its fate was rapidly changing. She would have so many children that she would outgrow her home (see *Gal 4:27*).\n\n
54:1	idm89387					 In the ancient world, a **woman** who had **never given birth** after being married for a time would be ashamed. Isaiah compares **Jerusalem** to a barren woman who rejoices at the long-awaited blessing of children (see *Gal 4:27*).\n\n
54:3	idm89397					 Israel’s **descendants** (cp. *53:10*) would **occupy other nations** in fulfillment of God’s promise to Abraham (*Gen 22:17*) and to Jacob (*Gen 28:14*). • As desolation took place (*Isa 6:11*; *14:21*), the people of God would inherit the earth and **resettle the ruined cities** (*51:6*; *52:10*; *65:17*; see also *Matt 5:5*; *Rom 4:13*).\n\n
54:5	idm89416					 **Creator . . . husband:** The Lord committed himself to the abandoned woman (his people in exile) as her maker (*44:24*) and husband (see also *62:4-5*; *Hos 2:19-20*). • The **Redeemer** transforms misery into freedom and fulfillment (see also *Isa 41:14*).\n\n
54:7	idm89428					 The pain of separation would be **brief** compared to the depth of the renewal of love and **compassion.** • The Lord **abandoned** Israel in exile **for a little while** because of the people’s sins. • **everlasting love:** The Lord is eternally committed to his people, making the seventy-year punishment of exile seem short indeed (see *25:1*; *Hos 2:1*).\n\n
54:9	idm89441					 The Exile was similar in both drama and trauma to the flood **in the time of Noah.** In both instances, people sinned grievously against the Lord, but the Lord renewed his commitment to creation (after Noah’s flood) and to his people (after the Exile).\n\n
54:10	idm89448					 God’s **faithful love** for his people endures despite their unfaithfulness. • God’s **covenant of blessing** was the assurance of his presence, resulting in wholeness, blessing, and protection. It replaces the shame and disgrace of the Exile (see *Ezek 34:25*; *37:26*).\n\n
54:11	idm89458					 This is a vision of the renewed Jerusalem as a city under God’s protection, a place of peace and righteousness (see *59:21–60:22*). This section forms the background of John’s vision of the new Jerusalem (*Rev 21:10-21*).\n\n
54:11	idm89466					 The Lord himself would **rebuild** the **city** (see *Heb 11:10*). • **Lapis lazuli** is a semi-precious stone.\n\n
54:13	idm89476					 **I will teach:** Jesus alluded to this verse in *John 6:45*. • **They will enjoy great peace***,* the benefits of God’s presence and protection (*Isa 53:5*; see *48:17-18*; *54:10*).\n\n
54:14	idm89489					 Jerusalem would again be a righteous city, **secure under a government that is just and fair** (see *1:26*).\n\n
54:15	idm89497					 God gives assurance that no **nation** can **defeat** his people . The Lord has promised to protect them, just as he had promised Abraham (*Gen 12:3*; see *Isa 49:25*).\n\n
54:17	idm89507					 **no weapon . . . will succeed . . . accuse you . . . vindication:** God will protect his people in war and in the courtroom. • **These benefits are enjoyed by the servants of the** Lord**:** Only the true children of God—people who come out of Israel and the nations—will enjoy the promised blessings of the age to come that God establishes.\n\n
55:1	idm89517					 This final chapter of the prophecies of comfort (chs *40–55*) summarizes the section’s prominent themes: blessing, covenant, witness, word, nations, glory, forgiveness, and joy.\n\n
55:1	idm89524					 **thirsty . . . wine or milk:** The invitation to eat and drink is similar to Wisdom’s call in *Prov 9:5*. The image promises the slaking of thirst not only by water but also by more costly items such as wine and milk. John applied a similar theme to Jesus Christ (*John 4:14*; *6:27*, *35*; *7:37*; *Rev 21:6*; *22:17*). • **it’s all free:** Reconciliation with God is for anyone and has no cost.\n\n
55:2	idm89539					 **Listen to me . . . eat what is good:** Responding positively to God satisfies one’s spiritual, social, and physical being (see *1:19*; *58:13-14*; *Prov 4:10*).\n\n
55:3	idm89549					 **Come to me. . . . Listen . . . find life:** Those who respond obediently to God’s word find eternal life (see also *55:11*). • **an everlasting covenant . . . I promised to David:** King David received a special covenant from God, a promise to preserve his kingly line (see *2 Sam 7:15-16*). David’s dynasty was eternally confirmed in the kingship of the Messiah, Jesus Christ (see *Isa 9:6-7*; *11:1-16*; *Acts 2:22-36*; *13:34*).\n\n
55:6	idm89563					 The prophet calls for a response while the time is right.\n\n
55:6	idm89569					 **while you can find him:** When God graciously extends an invitation to salvation, people must respond (*65:1*; *Jer 29:13-14*; *Hos 5:6*; *10:12*). Those who do not seek him at such times risk never having the opportunity again.\n\n
55:7	idm89580					 **Let the wicked change . . . turn to the** Lord**:** True conversion demands a change of how we live in favor of God’s requirements (see *1:16-17*; *30:15*; *59:20*). • **have mercy on them:** God’s compassion reaches out to the needy and finds them where they are. • **he will forgive generously:** Forgiveness of sin is foundational to the good news of redemption (see *Eph 1:7*; *Col 1:14*; see also *Pss 32:1*; *86:5*; *99:8*; *103:2-5*).\n\n
55:8	idm89600					 **My thoughts are nothing like your thoughts:** God’s plans are marvelous (*Ps 92:5*; cp. *Ps 94:11*). God’s creatures, including humans, can never fully understand the Creator’s thoughts, but his revelation through his messengers gives great insight and knowledge of some of the things he will do.\n\n
55:10	idm89609					 The Creator not only sends rain and snow but also his **word** (Hebrew *dabar*). In this context, *dabar* means his *will* or *plan* (see *14:24*; *40:8*). God’s written word, as an expression of God’s plan, accomplishes his purposes. God is effective in whatever he does (see *14:26-27*; *46:10*).\n\n
55:12	idm89624					 The prophet encourages his people to forget the past, to leave Babylon, and to accept the perspective of the coming age.\n\n
55:12	idm89630					 **Joy** is found in being redeemed from bondage. • Godly people experience an inner **peace** not known to the wicked (*48:22*). • **mountains and hills . . . trees of the field:** Creation participates in the freedom of the children of God (*44:23*; *49:11*, *13*; see *Rom 8:19-23*).\n\n
55:13	idm89644					 Redemption is like the transformation from desert to forest (see also *35:1*; *41:19*; *60:13*). • **great honor to the** Lord**’s name:** God’s glory will be more and more visible to humanity as his redemption takes effect.\n\n
56:1	idm89656					 This last major division of the book of Isaiah brings together themes from chs *1–39* (sin, justice and righteousness, responsibility, vengeance and vindication) and chs *40–55* (salvation, the age to come).\n\n
56:1	idm89664					 This section summarizes chs *1–55* with an invitation to the outcasts to participate in God’s redemption.\n\n
56:1	idm89671					 **Be just and fair:** A key aspect of the message of chs *1–39* is the call for justice in relationship with others and God. True godliness comes only through having character that is shaped by the character of God, which only happens by understanding and consistently applying God’s word. • **I am coming soon:** This statement summarizes the message of chs *40–55*, that the Lord is creating a world of harmony, peace, restoration, vindication, and the removal of enemies (*46:13*).\n\n
56:2	idm89682					 **Blessed:** Cp. *30:18*; *32:20*; see also *Pss 1:1*; *119:1*; *Matt 5:3*. • The **Sabbath***,* as a sign of the covenant (*Exod 31:13-17*), is God’s gift to his people; it belongs to this age as well as to the age to come (*Isa 56:4*, *6*; *58:13-14*; see *Heb 4:1-13*).\n\n
56:3	idm89701					 The blessing (*56:2*) would extend to eunuchs and to the Gentiles.\n\n
56:3	idm89708					 **Foreigners who commit themselves to the** Lord would become full participants in the covenant community. Previously, their participation had been carefully regulated (*Deut 23:3*, *7-8*). • **eunuchs:** In the past, an emasculated person was excluded from the community (*Deut 23:1*). Both eunuchs and foreigners had no share in Israel’s holiness and were considered marginal to God’s kingdom. In the age to come, God would bring to the center those who had previously been marginalized (cp. *Matt 20:16*).\n\n
56:4	idm89721					 The **Sabbath** is a sign of the covenant (*Exod 31:13-17*).\n\n
56:5	idm89729					 **within the walls of my house:** Those previously excluded would have a place in God’s presence. • **a memorial and a name:** Everlasting existence in God’s presence is better than the blessing of physical descendants.\n\n
56:6	idm89737					 The essential ingredient for covenant fellowship is **love** for God (*Deut 6:5*; *30:20*; *Matt 22:34-38*). • Keeping the **Sabbath** is a sign of keeping the **covenant** itself (see *Exod 31:13-17*).\n\n
56:7	idm89750					 **burnt offerings and sacrifices:** God had previously rejected sinful Israel’s expressions of piety (*1:11-13*) but would welcome offerings from righteous Gentiles or foreigners. Nationality is worth little without true piety. • **a house of prayer for all nations:** The Lord would open the doors of the Temple to all nations (see *2:2-4*). Jesus rebuked the people for desecrating the Temple and for preventing it from functioning as the house of prayer (*Matt 21:13*; *Mark 11:17*).\n\n
56:8	idm89762					 The **outcasts of Israel** were those dispersed among the nations as the result of the Exile (see also *11:12*). • The **others** would be eunuchs and Gentiles (*56:3-7*; see also *57:19*; *John 10:16*).\n\n
56:9	idm89774					 This is a reflection on the prevalence of evil among God’s people; they were greedy (*56:9-12*), hostile to the righteous (*57:1-2*), and idolatrous (*57:3-13*).\n\n
56:9	idm89783					 **Wild animals** are here a metaphor for the hostile nations surrounding Judah.\n\n
56:10	idm89790					 The leaders of Israel failed to guide and protect God’s people from the sins that led to the Exile. • **sleeping and dreaming:** See *29:10*.\n\n
56:11	idm89798					 **ignorant shepherds:** Israel’s leaders did not know how to rule in a godly way (see also *Ezek 34:1-6*). By contrast, the Lord is the faithful Shepherd of his people (*Isa 40:11*). • **all following their own path:** They had no concern for God or his standards of godly leadership (see also *53:6*). • **personal gain:** Cp. *33:15*.\n\n
57:1	idm89811					 This is a lament for the righteous who suffer in a wicked society.\n\n
57:1	idm89817					 **the evil to come:** Judgment that would come on the wicked nations. • **protecting them:** At times, God allows the godly to **die** in order to protect them from harsher times to come.\n\n
57:2	idm89826					 The wicked would not be able to **rest in peace** (*57:21*).\n\n
57:3	idm89834					 **witches’ children . . . adulterers and prostitutes:** Baal religion, which flourished in Israel before the Exile (see *1:21-23*), included lewd sexual practices.\n\n
57:4	idm89842					 **mock . . . sticking out your tongues:** The wicked oppressed the righteous by their insults (*57:1-2*; see also *28:9*, *14*).\n\n
57:5	idm89852					 **beneath the oaks and under every green tree:** Tree groves were commonly used as places of pagan worship (see *1:29-30*). • **sacrifice your children:** The horrible practice of child sacrifice was occasionally practiced in Israel (see *Ps 106:37-38*).\n\n
57:6	idm89862					 **Liquid offerings and grain offerings** were believed to satisfy the basic needs of the gods and thus to earn their favor.\n\n
57:8	idm89869					 **climbed into bed:** The people of Israel had a sickening commitment to the fertility religions, which included sex as part of their rituals.\n\n
57:11	idm89876					 The people were living in fear of false gods instead of fearing the Lord (see *8:12-13*).\n\n
57:12	idm89883					 The Lord did not consider the people’s **so-called good deeds** (literally *righteousness;* see *59:16*) to be truly righteous.\n\n
57:13	idm89892					 **your idols . . . fall over:** See *study note on 40:18*. • **inherit the land:** The Hebrew word translated **land** can also signify the whole earth (see *Pss 25:13*; *37:9*, *11*, *22*, *29*, *34*; *Matt 5:5*). • **my holy mountain:** God’s servants will enjoy God’s presence in Zion (see *Isa 2:2*; *56:7*).\n\n
57:14	idm89912					 The Lord here promises to be present with the humble, to heal them, and to grant them his peace. The promise extends to all the citizens of Zion, both Jews and Gentiles. The Holy One comes to the humble with an all-inclusive offer of salvation, while dealing justly with the wicked.\n\n
57:15	idm89918					 Even though God is **the high and lofty one***,* he promises to dwell with the humble.\n\n
57:18	idm89926					 **I will heal them anyway:** Salvation is by God’s grace (see *19:22*; *30:26*; *53:5*).\n\n
57:19	idm89936					 **words of praise:** God’s redemption should bring a response of praise from its recipients. • **both near and far:** Both Gentiles and Jews are included (see *56:3*; *John 10:16*; *Eph 2:17*).\n\n
57:20	idm89947					 **restless sea . . . never still:** Those who live in constant opposition to God (see *Pss 46:3*, *6*; *93:3-4*) do not enjoy inner quiet because they are not at peace with God (*Isa 30:15*; *32:17*). • **churns up mud and dirt:** Their activity has little productivity (see *Ps 40:2*).\n\n
57:21	idm89961					 **no peace:** Cp. *57:2*; see also *48:22*.\n\n
58:1	idm89970					 This is a charge against religious Israelites who were pleased with themselves because of their religious activities.\n\n
58:2	idm89976					 **they act so pious** (literally *they seek me*): They may have been truly committed to a religious form, but they failed to truly meet God in their religious activities.\n\n
58:3	idm89984					 **Fasting** should be a time of self-deprivation in order to focus on God and pleasing him (*Lev 16:29*; see *Zech 7:5*). However, these people were only interested in pleasing themselves and continuing in their sins.\n\n
58:5	idm89993					 This is a satirical portrayal of the people’s fasting as mere external piety without repentance and righteous acts. Ritualistic and insincere fasting is nothing but pomp. • Wearing **burlap** and **ashes** are expressions of sorrow and mourning. • **please the** Lord**?** The people erroneously believed that the Lord would bless them, if only they performed the right rituals.\n\n
58:6	idm90004					 True fasting creates an awareness of injustice and oppression and prompts the practitioner to reach out to help the needy in their struggles (see *42:7*; *Matt 25:35-36*; *Jas 1:27*).\n\n
58:8	idm90013					 **your salvation** (literally *your light*): The light of the coming age (see *42:6-7*; *60:1-3*) will **dawn** on those who turn fully to the Lord. The night of divine judgment and oppression will be over. • **your wounds:** The nation of Israel was wounded when they were conquered and sent into exile. • **protect you from behind:** See also *52:12*.\n\n
58:9	idm90027					 **the** Lord** will answer:** Cp. *1:15*; see also *19:22*. • **Stop . . . spreading vicious rumors:** God calls for an end to acts and words that destroy relationships (see *Prov 6:12-14*).\n\n
58:10	idm90040					 **your light . . . as bright as noon:** God would rescue and vindicate his people (see *Job 11:17*; *Ps 37:6*).\n\n
58:12	idm90049					 **a rebuilder of walls:** Nehemiah would later fulfill this promise (see *Neh 2:17*).\n\n
58:13	idm90057					 Like the practice of fasting, **the Sabbath** was intended to be an expression of self-denial and worship. It consists of delighting in the Lord, trusting him to provide for one’s needs while abstaining from work, and living in obedience to his will.\n\n
58:14	idm90064					 As people **honor** God through obedience, they themselves will be honored by God. • **the inheritance I promised to your ancestor Jacob:** The promised inheritance includes living with many descendants in the holy land and enjoying God’s presence, blessing, and protection (*Gen 31:3*; *35:9-12*).\n\n
59:1	idm90074					 The Lord alone can and will usher in his salvation. Like a warrior, he will break into the world to avenge himself on his enemies and to vindicate his holy people.\n\n
59:1	idm90080					 The people complained that the Lord could not rescue them, but the real problem was that they had not repented (*59:20*) and were still living in sin.\n\n
59:1	idm90087					 **not too weak:** The delay in their rescue could not be attributed to an inherent weakness in the Lord.\n\n
59:2	idm90094					 **your sins . . . cut you off:** The Israelites, like all people (*Rom 3:15-17*), had sinned, which resulted in alienation from God (**he has turned away**).\n\n
59:4	idm90103					 **being fair and honest:** Israel did not practice these qualities that are part of God’s nature and that he expects from people (*1:21*; see *25:1*).\n\n
59:5	idm90112					 The images of **deadly snakes** and **spiders’ webs** represent plans designed to destroy others’ lives and relationships.\n\n
59:7	idm90120					 Paul quotes from these verses in his description of the depravity of all people (*Rom 3:15-17*). • **Misery and destruction:** The people lamented being victims of oppression (*Isa 51:19*), yet they were oppressors themselves.\n\n
59:9	idm90129					 Israel’s history of rebellion was well established. The prophet here confesses the nation’s sins and laments that they could not apprehend the light of God’s salvation.\n\n
59:10	idm90135					 **people without eyes:** See *6:10*; *Deut 28:29*.\n\n
59:11	idm90144					 The people **growl** and **moan** with longing for redemption, finally coming to terms with their sinfulness.\n\n
59:15	idm90152					 The Lord goes out as a warrior intent on achieving victory against the wicked (cp. *Eph 6:14*).\n\n
59:18	idm90159					 **repay his enemies:** The Lord will dole out righteous retribution on the whole earth. His justice requires people to be judged for the evil they have done (see also *3:9-11*; *13:9*).\n\n
59:19	idm90168					 **In the west . . . in the east:** I.e., in all parts of the world.\n\n
59:21	idm90175					 The members of the new community have the **Spirit***,* and they know and practice God’s word (see also *Ezek 36:24-28*). The Lord promises to regenerate the **children** by his Spirit and bring them into the covenant of obedience and love for the Lord (*Joel 2:28*; *Acts 2:39*).\n\n
60:1	idm90187					 God will come to be with his people and will transform Zion’s destiny from the **darkness as black as night** caused by sin and judgment.\n\n
60:3	idm90194					  The transformation of **all nations** and **mighty kings** will be so radical that all kingdoms will take notice and be drawn to God through his people (see also *Rev 21:24*).\n\n
60:5	idm90203					 Zion’s losses from warfare will be restored by **the wealth of many lands***;* foreign nations will be eager to make a contribution (*60:11*; *61:6*; *66:12*; see *Rev 21:26*).\n\n
60:6	idm90215					 **Midian and Ephah** were Midianite tribes located southeast of Israel. • **Sheba** was a region in southern Arabia (see *1 Kgs 10:1-2*) famed for **frankincense** (*Jer 6:20*). • These were real nations—the restoration would be a historical reality, not just an idealistic vision. Many nations would submit themselves to and worship **the** Lord.\n\n
60:7	idm90228					 **Kedar** was a tribe in Arabia (*21:16-17*). • **Nebaioth** was an Ishmaelite tribe. • **I will make my Temple glorious:** The glory of God will be even more evident than it was in Solomon’s Temple (see *6:1-5*; *Hag 2:9*; *Rev 21:11*, *22*).\n\n
60:9	idm90242					 **filled you with splendor:** See *Rev 21:26*.\n\n
60:10	idm90250					 Those who previously oppressed the people of God will one day participate in restoring the holy city (see *2:2-4*; *19:18-25*; *Neh 2:8*; *Amos 9:12*).\n\n
60:10	idm90260					 **their kings will serve you:** God’s people who were previously humiliated (*2:11*) will be exalted.\n\n
60:11	idm90268					 There are two likely reasons for why the **gates** are not closed at night (see also *Rev 21:25*): (1) So much traffic will be coming into the city (*Isa 60:8-10*) that the gates will need to be open. (2) The citizens of Zion will no longer need to fear enemies because the Lord is their protector (*60:18*); the nations that remain will be serving the Lord and his people (*60:9*, *12*).\n\n
60:12	idm90280					 In the coming age, **nations** that refuse to obey God **will be destroyed**.\n\n
60:13	idm90288					 The **Temple** was God’s **sanctuary***,* the symbol of his presence on earth. Believers now are the temple of God by the indwelling Spirit (*1 Cor 3:16*). We still await the fullness of God’s presence (*Rev 21:22*).\n\n
60:15	idm90299					 **beautiful forever, a joy to all generations:** This would be radical change from the conditions of the Exile in Babylon. Fulfillments of this prophecy include the Jews’ restoration from exile, the coming of Jesus Christ, and the inclusion of the Gentiles in the church. The final fulfillment awaits the glorious second coming of Jesus Christ, which will usher in the new Jerusalem.\n\n
60:17	idm90306					 These verses portray Zion’s future grandeur (cp. *Rev 21:10–22:4*).\n\n
60:17	idm90313					 **gold . . . silver . . . bronze . . . iron:** These metals are for adornment and strength (cp. *54:11*; *Rev 21:15-21*). • **Peace** and **righteousness** will bring harmony and blessing among people and with God.\n\n
60:18	idm90324					 **praise will be on the lips of all who enter there** (literally *they will call your gates “praise”*): Entrance into the city of **salvation** will be through the metaphorical gates of praise to the Lord for his great salvation.\n\n
60:19	idm90333					 Natural sources of light such as **the sun** and **the moon** will be as nothing in comparison to the brightness of God’s presence (see also *9:2*; *30:26*; *Zech 2:5*; *Rev 21:23-24*).\n\n
60:21	idm90345					 The citizens of Zion will be **righteous***,* enjoying a right relationship with God and with others (*Rev 21:27*). • **their land:** Or *the entire earth* (*Isa 54:5*; *62:7*; *65:17*; *66:22*).\n\n
60:22	idm90360					 **I, the** Lord**:** The Lord identifies himself as the covenant God of Israel. His identity ensures that he **will make it happen** (see *27:3-4*).\n\n
61:1	idm90371					 The servant here proclaims the good news that his ministry will restore Zion. The Lord Jesus applied these words to his own mission (*Luke 4:18-19*).\n\n
61:1	idm90378					 The presence of God’s **Spirit** ensures the success of the servant’s mission (see *11:1-5*; *42:1*). • The servant will restore and heal the marginalized **poor** and the **brokenhearted** (see *25:4*).\n\n
61:2	idm90390					 The **time of the** Lord**’s favor** is the day of God’s salvation (see *49:8*). • **the day of God’s anger:** God now turns his wrath against the enemies of his people. It will be a day of righteous vengeance (see *34:8*; *63:3-4*).\n\n
61:3	idm90403					 Putting **ashes** on one’s head was a sign of **mourning** (note the reversal of the judgment stated in *3:16-25*). Mourning would be replaced by joy. The words translated **crown of beauty** and **ashes** form a wordplay in Hebrew. • **joyous blessing** (literally *oil of gladness*): A face covered with oil was a sign of blessing and well-being (see *Pss 45:8*; *133:2*). • The remnant would start out as small offshoots but would grow into **great oaks** (see *Isa 60:21*).\n\n
61:6	idm90420					 **priests . . . ministers:** The nation would fulfill its original calling (*Exod 19:6*).\n\n
61:7	idm90428					 The people had suffered God’s wrath for their sins (*40:2*); now they would receive **a double share** of God’s blessing.\n\n
61:8	idm90436					 Those who belong to the community of God’s people are to imitate the character of God, who loves **justice** (see *Mic 6:8*) and hates **wrongdoing** (*Isa 33:15*).\n\n
61:9	idm90446					 **Their descendants:** The covenant will be effective from generation to generation. • **The** Lord** has blessed** them in fulfillment of his promise to Abraham (*Gen 12:1-2*; see *Isa 65:23*).\n\n
61:10	idm90458					 **clothing of salvation . . . robe of righteousness:** With great joy God will clothe his people with the benefits of his salvation and righteousness (see *51:5*; *56:1*), **like a bridegroom . . . or a bride** (see *49:18*; *62:5*; *Jer 2:32*; *7:34*; *16:9*; *25:10*; *33:11*).\n\n
62:1	idm90475					 The servant here commits himself to proclaiming the good news continuously until the glory of Zion is realized.\n\n
62:2	idm90481					 The real beauty and **glory** of God’s people would not be seen in earthly treasures or a rebuilt city but would shine forth from their **righteousness**. Others would be drawn by this divine gift. • A **new name** reflects the change in Zion’s status (see *62:4*).\n\n
62:4	idm90491					 **The Forsaken City:** In the Exile, the Lord abandoned his people to the judgment they deserved (*54:7*). • **The Bride of God:** The people will be “married” to the Lord—an appropriate image for the close covenant relationship (*54:5*; *Hos 1–3*).\n\n
62:6	idm90502					 The **watchmen** probably represent the prophets. • **they will pray day and night:** They will continually seek the full restoration and blessing of Zion, unlike the destructive watchmen of *56:10*.\n\n
62:8	idm90511					 The Lord swore an oath just as he did when he had **sworn** an oath to Noah (*Gen 8:20–9:17*), to Abraham (*Gen 22:16*; see also *Luke 1:73*; *Heb 6:13*), and to David (*Ps 89:3*). • **I will never again hand you over:** In order to punish and purge a remnant from his people, God had intentionally brought in the Assyrians and Babylonians to decimate them (see *Isa 6:12-13*). He would never do this again.\n\n
62:9	idm90525					 The people would eat and drink the fruit of their labor (*65:13*, *22*; see *Lev 23:39-40*; *Deut 14:22-26*). This is the opposite of what happened when God judged them (see *Deut 28:38-40*; *Amos 5:11*; *Mic 6:14-15*).\n\n
62:10	idm90538					 This call to prepare for God’s coming salvation combines elements from all parts of Isaiah: the proclamation (the signal or banner, see *5:26*), the preparation of the road (*40:3*; *57:14*), the coming of God with his reward (*40:5*, *9-10*), and the holy and redeemed citizenry (*35:8-10*).\n\n
62:10	idm90550					 **highway:** See also *40:3*; *57:14*. • A **flag for all the nations to see** is a signal that directs foreigners to come to Zion for God’s salvation. Earlier, a similar signal was used to call for the nations to attack Judah (*5:26*).\n\n
63:1	idm90561					 The judgment of Edom typifies God’s judgment of all the nations (see also *34:5-15*).\n\n
63:1	idm90568					 The Lord’s robes are **stained red** with blood (*63:3*; cp. *Rev 19:13*). • The name **Bozrah** (Hebrew *botsrah*) is a wordplay on the verb *batsar* (“gather grapes”).\n\n
63:2	idm90580					 The term **red** (Hebrew *’adom*) is a wordplay on the name *Edom.*\n\n
63:4	idm90589					 **the time . . . to avenge my people:** See *study note on 34:8*. • **to ransom:** See *study note on 43:1*.\n\n
63:6	idm90599					 **made them stagger:** The wicked nations would be forced to drink from the intoxicating cup of God’s wrath (*49:26*; *51:17*, *21*).\n\n
63:7	idm90609					 The prophet reflects on Israel’s past, how God showed his unfailing love and how his people alternatively rebelled against him, suffered hardship, returned to the Lord, and experienced his blessing.\n\n
63:7	idm90615					 **unfailing love . . . all he has done . . . his great goodness:** The whole history of God’s care for his people demonstrates his compassion, provision, and protection.\n\n
63:8	idm90622					 **They are my very own people:** God’s possession of and commitment to his people was central to the covenant (see *43:1*). • **they will not betray me:** The Lord expected his own people to honor their relationship with him, unlike the nations, whose story is a history of treachery (*Gen 3–11*). But Israel, too, betrayed their God (*Isa 63:10*). • **their Savior:** God rescued and protected his people (see *43:3*).\n\n
63:9	idm90635					 **he also suffered:** God identified with his suffering people, and their suffering brought him grief. Later, Jesus suffered on behalf of all humanity. • **and he personally rescued them:** e.g., see *Exod 12:25-33*; *14:10-31*; *23:20-23*.\n\n
63:10	idm90646					 **But they rebelled:** See also *1:2*, *4*; *59:1-15*; *Pss 78*, *106*. • Persistent disobedience and unbelief **grieved his Holy Spirit** (*Ps 106:33*; *Matt 12:32*; *Mark 3:29*). • **he became their enemy:** Examples include Israel’s period of wandering in the wilderness (see the book of Numbers), the period of the judges (see the book of Judges), and the period leading up to the Exile (see the book of Jeremiah).\n\n
63:14	idm90663					 God **gave** his people **rest** after he brought them into the Promised Land (see *63:9*; *Josh 1:13*; *22:4*; *23:1*).\n\n
63:15	idm90675					 The prophet’s reflections on the past (*63:7-14*) inspire him to pray that God would now rescue his people as he has done before.\n\n
63:16	idm90682					 **our Father:** God’s fatherhood and his commitment to his children are much more important and secure than national ancestry (see *9:6*; *64:8*; *Deut 32:6*; *Ps 68:5*; *Mal 2:10*; *Matt 6:9-15*; *Rom 8:15-17*).\n\n
63:17	idm90696					 The prophet understands that God has the power to keep his people faithful, so he asks, **why have you allowed us to turn from your path?** • **Return and help us:** God likewise has the power to call his people back to himself (*Ezek 36:25-27*) and to defeat all their enemies.\n\n
63:18	idm90705					 The **people** were supposed to be **holy***,* but their lack of holiness had led to destruction. • The **holy place** was the Temple, which the Babylonians destroyed in 586 BC (*64:11*; *2 Kgs 25:1-21*).\n\n
63:19	idm90718					 Israel was constantly turning from God and then being punished by him.\n\n
64:5	idm90724					 **constant sinners . . . infected and impure with sin:** See also *59:1-15*. The only hope for salvation and transformation is through Jesus Christ (see *Rom 7:25–8:11*).\n\n
64:7	idm90733					 **you have turned away from us:** See *1:15*; *30:20*; *59:2*. • **turned us over to our sins***:* Because the people were so bent on sinning, God left them to perish in their sinful ways (see *Rom 1:24*).\n\n
64:8	idm90746					 **clay . . . potter:** See also *29:16*; *45:9*; *Rom 9:20-21*.\n\n
64:10	idm90756					 **holy cities:** All the cities of Judah were considered holy to God. However, the Temple in the host city of Jerusalem was the most holy place.\n\n
65:1	idm90763					 Here the Lord responds to the prayer in *63:7–64:12*.\n\n
65:1	idm90770					 The Lord opened up every opportunity for the people of Israel to seek him (*55:6*; *58:2*), but they did not do so.\n\n
65:3	idm90778					 **Sacred gardens** were a part of the fertility religion of Baal.\n\n
65:4	idm90785					 **worshiping the dead:** God had banned the practice of necromancy (consulting dead spirits; see *8:19-22*; *47:9*; *Deut 18:9-11*). • **the flesh of pigs . . . other forbidden foods:** See *Isa 66:3-4*; *Lev 11:7*; *Deut 14:3*, *8*.\n\n
65:5	idm90800					 **you will defile me! I am holier than you!** The people of Israel used the language of ritual purification, as stated in the laws of Moses, yet they practiced rites influenced by paganism. Because of this hypocrisy, they were a **stench** in God’s **nostrils** (see *1:10-15*).\n\n
65:6	idm90810					 **my decree is written out:** God is fully committed to carry out his plan. • The godly had asked whether the Lord would **stand silent** forever (*64:12*). God answered that he would not but would deal with the wicked before restoring the righteous remnant.\n\n
65:7	idm90819					 The people of Israel practiced their pagan religion at sacred shrines on **mountains** and **hills** (see *1 Kgs 14:23*; *Hos 4:13*).\n\n
65:8	idm90829					 The Lord planned to spare and reward a remnant of righteous people.\n\n
65:10	idm90835					 **Sharon** was a fertile and beautiful marshy region southwest of Mount Carmel (see *33:9*). The **valley of Achor** in the vicinity of Jericho was associated with the curse on Achan (*Josh 7:24-26*); it would be transformed into a place of blessing (*Hos 2:15*). These western and eastern regions might represent the renewal of the whole land.\n\n
65:11	idm90846					 **Fate** and **Destiny** are names of pagan gods (*Gad, Meni*) that were thought to bring fortune and determine one’s destiny.\n\n
65:12	idm90855					 **‘destine’:** This verb (Hebrew *manithi*) is a wordplay on Meni (see *study note on 65:11*). God alone controls human and national destinies.\n\n
65:13	idm90864					 The contrast between the wicked (addressed as **you**) and God’s **servants** pertains to all areas of life. God punishes the wicked but blesses those who truly serve him (see *65:17-25*).\n\n
65:15	idm90873					 The new **name** given to the faithful represents a new identity and a deeper relationship with the Lord (see also *62:2*).\n\n
65:16	idm90881					 **evil of earlier days:** Cp. *Rev 21:4*.\n\n
65:17	idm90889					 The **new heavens** and **new earth** will be a place of righteousness (see also *2 Pet 3:13*; *Rev 21*). Paul described those who believe in Christ as already being part of the new creation (see *2 Cor 5:17*; *Gal 6:15*).\n\n
65:18	idm90901					 **Jerusalem** here symbolizes God’s eternal kingdom (*Rev 21:1-4*).\n\n
65:24	idm90909					 God will be present with his people (see also *19:22*; *30:19*; cp. *1:15*; *59:2*).\n\n
65:25	idm90919					 **The snakes** represent evil (*27:1*; *Gen 3*).\n\n
66:1	idm90928					 **my throne . . . my footstool:** God’s kingdom extends over all creation (see *40:22*; *Matt 5:34-35*). • **a temple . . . a resting place:** Because the entire universe is God’s dwelling place, humans cannot limit him to a building (see *1 Kgs 8:27*). • Stephen quoted *Isa 66:1-2a* in his last sermon (*Acts 7:49-50*).\n\n
66:2	idm90941					 God is pleased to dwell with **those who have humble and contrite hearts** (*57:15*; *Ps 51:17*). • **who tremble at my word:** The humble and contrite submit themselves to God’s will, whereas the arrogant resist it.\n\n
66:3	idm90951					 **delighting in their detestable sins:** Literally *delighting in* *abominations,* which refers to pagan worship practices. • **sacrifice a bull . . . blessed an idol:** Wicked people brought sacrifices as prescribed by the law, but their sin rendered those sacrifices equivalent to pagan offerings (see *1:11-17*).\n\n
66:6	idm90962					 **terrible noise from the Temple:** This parallels the situation described in *Ezek 9* when God’s executioner began to destroy the wicked people of Jerusalem. • **vengeance against his enemies:** God would deal out retribution to the disobedient members of his own people. They were his enemies because of their persistent sin and rejection of God.\n\n
66:7	idm90971					 **birth pains . . . gives birth to a son:** See *9:6-7*; *54:1-3*.\n\n
66:8	idm90980					 **by the time . . . her children will be born:** A miraculous repopulation of Zion would occur (see *49:19-20*; *54:1-3*; cp. *1:8-9*).\n\n
66:9	idm90990					 The Lord promised that he would surely recreate his holy nation.\n\n
66:12	idm90996					 **a river:** The people, who lost **peace and prosperity** in the Exile, would receive it back abundantly (see *48:18*).\n\n
66:13	idm91005					 **I will comfort you:** Cp. *40:1*.\n\n
66:14	idm91013					 **flourish like the grass:** Contrast *40:7*; *64:6*. • God’s **enemies** included the disobedient from the foreign nations and from within Israel (see *61:2*; *66:6*).\n\n
66:15	idm91025					 **the** Lord** is coming with fire:** God will appear with furious judgment against his enemies (see *Ps 7:13*). By contrast, he will reveal his glory to his people (see *Isa 40:5*, *10*). • God **will judge** all creation as a part of the process of renewing **the earth** (see *24:1-4*; *65:17*).\n\n
66:17	idm91041					 Apostates who **‘consecrate’ and ‘purify’ themselves** through idolatrous practices are an abomination to God (cp. *1:28-31*; *65:4*).\n\n
66:18	idm91050					 When God reveals his glory to all people, the nations join in God’s plan of redemption; they can even serve as priests and Levites before him. The godly from all nations last from generation to generation as they serve the living God.\n\n
66:19	idm91056					 The **sign** is the proclamation of God’s glory among the nations (*66:20*). God will establish a righteous and faithful new people consisting of godly Gentiles together with faithful Israelites (*Rev 15:3-4*; see also *Acts 2*).\n\n
66:21	idm91066					 That some of the Gentiles would serve as **priests and Levites** signifies the removal of God’s distinction between Hebrews and Gentiles (see *56:7*; see also *Gal 6:15*; *Eph 4:11-13*).\n\n
66:22	idm91076					 **always be my people:** God’s promise to Abraham was secure (*Gen 17:7*; see also *Gal 3:8*, *14*). • **a name that will never disappear:** The identity of this new people will last forever (see *Isa 59:21*).\n\n
66:24	idm91088					 Isaiah gives a final warning of the severity of God’s judgment. The book begins and ends with the condemnation of **those who have rebelled** (see *1:2-4*). • The judgment of God on wicked humans will generate **utter horror** because such people will have no hope and no relief from suffering (see also *Matt 5:22*; *25:41*; *Mark 9:47-48*; *Rev 20:11-15*).\n\n
