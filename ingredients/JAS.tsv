1:1	idm166864					 **James:** See “*James, Brother of Jesus*” Profile. • By identifying his readers as **the “twelve tribes,”** James affirms Christianity’s continuity with Israel’s heritage. The Exile had dispersed the twelve tribes, but Jewish interpreters looked forward to God reuniting them (see *Psalms of Solomon* 17:26-28; *Testament of Benjamin* 9:2; cp. *Ezek 37:15-28*; *Matt 19:28*). Christ has spiritually brought an end to Israel’s exile and reunited the tribes. • Jews **scattered abroad** (Greek diaspora) were living outside Palestine (*John 7:35*; *Acts 2:5*; *8:1*; *11:19*). • **Greetings!** (Greek chairein): This greeting is typical in first-century Greek letters (*Acts 15:23*; *23:26*) and interpersonally (*Matt 26:49*; *Luke 1:28*).\n\n
1:2	idm166889					 Enduring troubles and temptations is a recurring theme (*1:12-15*; *5:7-12*). Failure to endure is “wandering from the truth” that requires being “saved from death” (*5:19-20*).\n\n
1:2	idm166898					 **Dear brothers and sisters:** See *study note on 2:1*. • James uses a wordplay: **joy** (Greek chara) here is related to *greetings* in *1:1*.\n\n
1:5	idm166910					 James introduces **wisdom** as a recurring theme (cp. *3:13-18*).\n\n
1:6	idm166918					 **Do not waver, for a person with divided loyalty:** The Greek is often translated “Do not doubt, for a person who doubts,” but the sense here is of a person whose loyalty is divided between God and the world (see *1:8*).\n\n
1:8	idm166926					 **Their loyalty is divided between God and the world** (literally *They are double-minded*): James might have created the Greek word used here. He emphasizes the need for confidence in God alone.\n\n
1:9	idm166934					 Poverty and wealth are a recurring theme (cp. ch *2*; *4:13–5:11*). James does not promise material wealth to the righteous poor but announces a future reversal in heaven.\n\n
1:9	idm166942					 **something to boast about:** In the New Testament, boasting is usually viewed negatively (*3:14*; *4:16*; *Eph 2:9*), but here it means boasting about what God has done (*Jas 2:5*; *Rom 15:18*; *1 Cor 1:31*; *Gal 6:14*).\n\n
1:10	idm166956					** those who are rich should boast:** With irony, James is describing the dreadful fate of the ungodly rich who elevate themselves by oppressing poor and vulnerable people (see *2:6-8*; *5:1-6*).\n\n
1:12	idm166965					 James addresses the same three topics as in *1:2-11*, adding a new dimension to each topic. External testing (*1:2-4*) becomes internal temptation (*1:11-18*); the need for wisdom (*1:5-8*) is related to controlling angry speech (*1:19-21*); and poverty/wealth relate to the need to act upon God’s word (*1:22-25*). The section then summarizes these themes (*1:26-27*).\n\n
1:12	idm166978					** Those who love him** are faithful and obedient (cp. *1:22-25*; *2:5*; *Deut 7:9*; *1 Jn 5:2*).\n\n
1:13	idm166989					** do not say:** James is using *diatribe*, an ancient Greek rhetorical technique in which an imaginary opponent presents a contrary opinion. In this way he is able to voice the readers’ possible objection and immediately refute it (also in *2:3*, *16*, *18*; *4:13*). • **God is never tempted to do wrong:** The alternate translation (see footnote) dulls the parallelism with **he never tempts**.\n\n
1:14	idm167003					 Like hooks for fishing or traps for hunting, **desires** . . . **entice us** into sin and **drag us away** from faithfulness to God.\n\n
1:15	idm167012					 When evil desires conceive, they give birth to **sinful actions** (literally *sin,* personified as an infant). When the infant sin is **allowed to grow** to full maturity, it **gives birth to death***,* in opposition to “the crown of [eternal] life” (*1:12*).\n\n
1:17	idm167024					 **God** is the **Father** *of* **lights** (see footnote) since he **created** everything in the **heavens** (*Gen 1:3*, *14-17*). In contrast to the moving lights in the heavens, God **never changes or casts a shifting shadow**.\n\n
1:18	idm167039					 God’s **true word** is the Good News (*1:21-23*; *1 Pet 1:23-25*). • **give birth:** The imagery of a mother giving birth shows the full scope of God’s parental love for his children (cp. *Luke 13:34*; *John 1:13*; *3:3-8*; *1 Pet 1:23*). • **his prized possession:** Literally *a kind of firstfruit* (cp. *Exod 23:16*; *Lev 23:9-14*; *1 Cor 15:20*; *Col 1:18*). Christians are examples of the ultimate restoration of all creation (*Rom 8:20-22*).\n\n
1:21	idm167060					** get rid of:** Literally* put off,* like filthy clothing; cp. *Eph 4:22*; *1 Pet 2:1*. • **the word God has planted . . . has the power to save your souls:** James emphasizes that Christians are called to respond to a word that God himself has put within our very beings (in fulfillment of *Jer 31:31-34*). • The soul refers to the whole person (so also in *Jas 5:20*; see *Gen 2:7*; *1 Pet 3:20*).\n\n
1:22	idm167075					 In several places, James appears to be reflecting on Jesus’ teachings. These verses reflect the teaching of Jesus (*Matt 7:24*, *26*; *Luke 6:46*, *49*).\n\n
1:22	idm167085					** don’t just listen to God’s word:** Reading the scriptures was an important part of worship (*Luke 4:16-17*; *Acts 13:13-16*; *Col 4:16*; *1 Tim 4:13*). Since most people could not read and copies were not readily available, they listened to the readings in public worship.\n\n
1:24	idm167096					 **forget what you look like:** The problem is not the poor quality of an ancient mirror but the inattention of the viewer (cp. *Matt 7:24-27*).\n\n
1:25	idm167104					** law that sets you free:** God’s word gives us new birth and salvation (*1:18*, *21*) but demands that we **do what it says** (*1:22-25*).\n\n
1:26	idm167115					 **control** (literally *bridle*) **your tongue:** James uses the graphic image of the bridle in a horse’s mouth to say that people’s ability to control their tongue indicates the condition of their heart and the whole direction of their life (cp. *3:1-13*). • **Orphans and widows** were the most helpless members of ancient society. They were dependent upon the care of others, since the husband and father was the means of economic support and social contact (*Exod 22:22-24*; *Deut 10:18*). Christians are called to take care of the helpless (cp. *1 Tim 5:3-16*). • In James, **the world** stands in opposition to God (cp. *Jas 3:15*; *4:4*; *Rom 12:2*; *1 Jn 2:15-17*).\n\n
2:1	idm167134					 James gives a realistic illustration to enforce his prohibition against favoring the wealthy.\n\n
2:1	idm167140					 **dear brothers and sisters** (Greek adelphoi): The Greek word used here means *members of the same family*—in this case, *fellow Christians*—of either sex. James frequently begins a new section with this affectionate greeting (*1:2*, *16*; *2:14*; *3:1*; *5:7*, *19*), soliciting their loyal response. • James contrasts **our glorious Lord Jesus Christ** with the glory of a well-dressed man (*2:2*). Christ’s glory includes his resurrection, exaltation, and second coming.\n\n
2:2	idm167158					 **your meeting** (literally *your synagogue*): This word refers to the gathering of people rather than the building in which they met. • The **fancy clothes and expensive jewelry** of the rich, in contrast to the **dirty clothes** of the poor, symbolize the contrast in socioeconomic status.\n\n
2:3	idm167168					 It is natural to **give special attention** to wealthy people because of their social status, political power, and potential generosity as patrons. By serving and publicly honoring the wealthy, the church could gain whatever economic benefits they wished to give. James warns that **this discrimination** reflects **evil motives***,* a division between loyalty to God (*1:6*) and a desire for the benefits of worldly wealth (*4:4*).\n\n
2:5	idm167180					 **Listen to me:** Employing this rhetorical device for emphasis (see *Deut 6:3*; *Amos 3:1*; *Matt 13:18*; *Acts 15:13*), James presents his argument against favoring the rich. • **Hasn’t God chosen the poor?** God’s special concern for the poor is reflected in the Old Testament (*Exod 23:11*; *1 Sam 2:8*; *Ps 12:5*) and in the ministries of Jesus and Paul (*Luke 4:18*; *6:20*; *1 Cor 1:26-28*). This concern was emphasized by the Jerusalem church (*Gal 2:9-10*), of which James was the leader. • **inherit the Kingdom:** The Kingdom of God was central to the teaching of Jesus (*Matt 12:8*; *Mark 1:15*; *Luke 17:21*). Christ already rules from his place at the right hand of the Father, yet his Kingdom will be fully realized only when the Son of Man comes (*Matt 25:31*, *34*; *1 Cor 15:24-28*).\n\n
2:7	idm167206					 **name you bear** (literally *name spoken over you*): The name is Jesus Christ (*2:1*). It is a sign of ownership, pronounced at the time of conversion and baptism.\n\n
2:8	idm167215					 James applies biblical evidence to counter the common practice of favoring rich and powerful people.\n\n
2:8	idm167221					 Christians are to **obey** (literally *fulfill*) **the royal law***,* just as Jesus fulfilled the law by his coming (*Matt 5:17*) and his teaching (*Matt 22:34-40*). • The law is called *royal* because it belongs to the Kingdom (*Jas 2:5*) and was articulated by our glorious Lord (King). • **as found in the Scriptures:** James changes from a general reference to the law to a specific written commandment from the holiness code (*Lev 19*). It specifies how our love for God is to be expressed in relationships with other people (see *Lev 19:18*; *Deut 6:5*). • **“Love your neighbor as yourself”:** This quotation from *Lev 19:18* requires identifying with the neighbor as though the neighbor were yourself.\n\n
2:9	idm167241					 Favoritism violates the command to love one’s neighbor (*2:8*).\n\n
2:12	idm167248					 **The law** . . . **sets you free** from the controlling power of sin (see *1:25* and *corresponding study note*) and thereby promotes endurance and growth toward perfection (*1:3-4*).\n\n
2:13	idm167259					 James concludes this section (*2:1-13*) by correlating divine mercy with human mercy (see also *Matt 6:14-15*; *Eph 4:32*).\n\n
2:14	idm167268					 James explains why Christians need to be concerned about the judgment of their actions (*2:12-13*): Real faith must be accompanied by good deeds (see *1:22-25*).\n\n
2:14	idm167276					 **if you say you have faith:** James writes to Christians who need to be stimulated to produce **actions** that should arise from genuine faith. Paul makes the same point (see, e.g., *Gal 5:6*) but often criticizes people for trying to base their relationship with God on what they do (*Rom 3:20*, *28*; *4:3-5*; *Gal 2:16*; *3:1-14*).\n\n
2:15	idm167290					 **Suppose you see:** As in *2:2-4*, James gives an illustration of “faith” that is useless. • **no food or clothing:** In first-century Palestine and the Roman world in general, many poverty-stricken persons lacked the bare necessities of life. • **stay warm and eat well:** This sentence probably expresses a presumption that God would provide the needs of the poor person. The speaker might suppose that what is needed is simply an expression of faith that it will happen. But without participation (action), it is an empty wish.\n\n
2:18	idm167300					 James demonstrates the futility of believing that something is true without acting upon it. • **Now someone may argue:** James presents another diatribe (see *study note on 1:13*), in which he presents a hypothetical counterargument that one person may have the gift of faith while another person has the gift of works (see *1 Cor 12:7-9*).\n\n
2:19	idm167309					 **that there is one God:** This is the basic confession of Israel’s faith (see *Deut 6:4*). • **the demons believe:** They know that there is one God, and he is their enemy (*Mark 1:24*).\n\n
2:20	idm167319					 James demonstrates from Scripture that genuine faith finds expression in action.\n\n
2:22	idm167325					 This verse explains *2:21* so it won’t be misunderstood: Abraham was not justified by **his actions** alone; instead, **his faith and his actions worked together**. This describes the full scope of Abraham’s faithful response to God throughout his life (see *Gen 12:1-4*; *18:1-27*).\n\n
2:23	idm167336					 **it happened just as the Scriptures say** (literally *the Scripture was fulfilled*): James saw the offering of Isaac (*Gen 22*) as the fulfillment of Abraham’s pledge of faith and God’s declaration of Abraham’s righteousness (quoted from *Gen 15:6*). • **He was even called the friend of God:** James emphasizes the nature of faith as a relationship of undivided loyalty (*Jas 1:5-8*; *4:4*; *John 15:15*).\n\n
2:24	idm167350					 **not by faith alone:** That is, not like the demons who merely believe something is true (*2:19*), but by a belief that results in generous deeds like those of God himself (*1:17*). Though some have thought that this teaching contradicts what Paul taught, it does not. Paul does not speak against good deeds themselves, but about trying to receive forgiveness of sins through good deeds (*Rom 3:28*; *Gal 2:16*). Just as Paul understands that love and generosity necessarily issue from a true faith (*Gal 5:6*), so also James knows that good deeds can result only from authentic faith that results in a commitment to God (*Jas 2:18*, *26*).\n\n
2:25	idm167364					 James presents **Rahab the prostitute** (see *Josh 2:1*) as his second example of how good works must accompany genuine faith. She declared her belief that the Lord God of Israel was the only God (*Josh 2:9-11*), and her faith was made perfect **by her actions** when she provided hospitality and a means of escape to the Israelite spies (*Josh 2:1-6*; *6:25*; *Heb 11:31*).\n\n
2:26	idm167377					 **Good works** are as necessary to **faith** as **breath** is to a physical **body** (*Gen 2:7*). We cannot have one without the other.\n\n
3:1	idm167388					 Becoming **teachers** was one way to improve social status in the early church (*1 Cor 12:28*; *Eph 4:11*; *1 Tim 5:17*; cp. *Acts 5:34*). Such honor would compensate for the shame imposed upon Christians as social outsiders (*Jas 2:6-7*). But the conspicuous role of teachers symbolizes the power of human speech to benefit or harm the church.\n\n
3:2	idm167400					 **we all:** James’s primary concern is with the speech of church members as they influence interpersonal relationships (*3:9-10*, *14*; *4:1-3*).\n\n
3:6	idm167410					 **It is a whole world of wickedness:** The tongue acts as an agent of the whole unrighteous world opposed to God (*1:27*; *4:4*). • **hell itself:** Greek *Gehenna,* the place of eternal punishment (*Matt 5:22*, *30*; *23:15*), in contrast to *Hades,* the abode of the dead (*Luke 16:23*; *Acts 2:31*). The reference to hell is an allusion to the devil (*Jas 4:7*; *Matt 5:22*; *John 8:44*) as the ultimate source of evil speech.\n\n
3:8	idm167430					 **no one can tame the tongue:** The tongue has an astonishing capacity for committing evil. If its evil is motivated by hell (*3:6*), it certainly cannot be tamed by mere human effort. • **full of deadly poison:** This might allude to the serpent in the Garden of Eden (*Gen 3:1*), who is identified with the devil (*Rev 20:2*).\n\n
3:9	idm167441					 **praises . . . curses:** Praising **our Lord and Father** is the best activity of the tongue, whereas cursing **those** made in his **image** is one of the worst, because it is an implicit curse on God himself (*Gen 1:26-27*; *9:6*).\n\n
3:11	idm167453					 Some springs, especially in the upper sources of the Jordan River, did produce **fresh water and bitter water***;* such brackish springs could not support a town. Similarly, if a person’s speech mixes foul with sweet, it will not build up the community.\n\n
3:13	idm167461					 **If you are wise and understand:** The wisdom that comes from God (*1:5*) is not mere intellectual skill nor the collection of information, it is practical insight and spiritual understanding which expresses itself in moral uprightness, as described in *3:17-18* (see also *Job 28:28*; *Prov 1:2-4*; *2:10-15*).\n\n
3:14	idm167473					 The **truth** is that wisdom cannot be associated with jealousy and **selfish ambition**. Only in humility can we receive God’s true word (*1:18*, *21*).\n\n
3:15	idm167483					 The wisdom that is **earthly** is not part of the good creation; it is the opposite of heavenly wisdom because it excludes God. It is **unspiritual** because it does not acknowledge or respond to God’s Spirit (*1 Cor 2:14*; *Jude 1:19*). It is **demonic** since it comes from the devil, the ultimate source of this destructive wisdom (*Jas 3:6*; *4:6*; *1 Tim 4:1*).\n\n
3:18	idm167497					 James uses an agricultural image to emphasize the benefits of living by the wisdom from above: Those who plant **seeds of peace** in relationships will enjoy a luxuriant **harvest of righteousness** in those relationships (cp. *Matt 5:9*).\n\n
4:1	idm167506					 **quarrels and fights** (literally *wars and battles*): James uses military imagery to declare that their own **evil desires at war within** them were the immediate cause of the battles among church members. James uses the Greek word translated *evil desires* again in *4:3* (translated “pleasure”) to enclose the entire paragraph and indicate the source of conflict and unanswered prayer (*Luke 8:14*; *Titus 3:3*).\n\n
4:2	idm167519					 **you scheme and kill:** Killing was the extreme, but logical, outcome of their rapacious attitude. Some of James’s readers might have followed the Jewish Zealot movement and engaged in murder to benefit their cause. Hostile attitudes and violent methods do not provide satisfaction—**you can’t get** what you want by them.\n\n
4:4	idm167527					 James explains the causes of conflict: love for the world, divided loyalty, and arrogant criticism (*4:11-12*). He gives exhortations which will rectify these causes and lead to peace.\n\n
4:4	idm167534					 **You adulterers:** James uses this prophetic imagery (see, e.g., *Jer 3:6*; *Hos 3:1*) because his readers were seeking what **friendship with the world** could give them—social acceptance (*Jas 2:1-4*), prestige (*3:1*), or wealth (*4:13*). Divided loyalty toward God (*4:8*) is like adultery against one’s spouse. • In the ancient world, **friend** was used as a title for special and exclusive relationships (*Luke 23:12*, Herod and Pilate; *John 19:12*, Pilate as “friend of Caesar”; see also *1 Maccabees* 2:18; 6:28). Both Moses (*Exod 33:11*) and Abraham were called friends of God (*Jas 2:23*; *2 Chr 20:7*; *Isa 41:8*; cp. *John 15:15*). • The **world** consists of society that is opposed to **God** and his kingdom. The world is guided by earthly wisdom, not heavenly (*Jas 3:15-17*), and is characterized by evil desires, fighting, and killing (*4:2-3*).\n\n
4:5	idm167561					 **Scriptures . . . say:** James summarizes one of the messages of Scripture, **that the spirit he has placed within us should be faithful to him.**\n\n
4:7	idm167569					 **Resist the devil:** See also *Eph 6:11*; *1 Pet 5:8*.\n\n
4:8	idm167578					 **Come close to God:** This is the language of friendship (*2:23*) and loyalty (*1:6-8*). • **Wash your hands . . . purify your hearts:** The language of ceremonial cleansing is applied to the inner purity of one’s intentions (cp. *Mark 7:1-23*).\n\n
4:10	idm167589					 To those who **humble** themselves before him, God gives **honor** in place of the shame of their persecution and oppression (*Jas 2:6-7*).\n\n
4:11	idm167598					 These verses reflect on *Matt 7:1* and *Luke 6:37* (see *study note on Jas 1:22-23*).\n\n
4:11	idm167607					 **Don’t speak evil against each other:** This exhortation for peace in the Christian community requires that Christians not slander each other. Slandering one’s neighbor is the same as slandering **God’s law***,* because the law prohibits slander and demands love for one’s neighbor (*2:8*; *Lev 19:16-18*; *Matt 7:1-5*).\n\n
4:13	idm167619					 Itinerant merchants depended on personal assertiveness as a solution to their poverty and low social status. James urges greater recognition of God’s providence and warns against arrogantly planning events which one cannot really control.\n\n
4:15	idm167625					 The **Lord** has authority over life and death (*Deut 32:39*; *1 Sam 2:6*; *Matt 10:28*).\n\n
4:16	idm167635					 Christians may boast about what God has done (*1:9-10*), but not about their own arrogant **plans***,* which assume that God has no claim or authority over their lives.\n\n
4:17	idm167644					 **Remember: **This verse is probably a maxim that James expected his readers to recognize. Its source is unknown, but it is consistent with the teaching of Scripture (cp. *Deut 24:15*; *Prov 3:27-28*; *Matt 25:41-46*; *Luke 12:47*).\n\n
5:1	idm167655					 This section denounces the **rich people** for their greed and arrogant oppression of the poor (*Lev 19:13*). James warns them to repent while they can; if they do not, they will face **terrible troubles** . . . **on the day of judgment**.\n\n
5:2	idm167665					 The **wealth** and **fine clothes** are so excessive that they deteriorate from lack of use; their destruction is a sign of the anticipated judgment.\n\n
5:3	idm167673					 Material wealth, represented by **gold** and **silver***,* is worthless in the face of God’s **judgment**. In fact, it **will testify against** them because it was unjustly gotten (*5:4*) and wickedly used (*5:5-6*).\n\n
5:4	idm167686					 These rich people (*5:1*) were exploitive landowners. Like those in *2:6* who oppressed and dragged Christians into court, they were exploiting the day laborers whose work was to **harvest** their **fields**. • **cries . . . have reached the ears of the** Lord**:** God hears the prayers of the oppressed (see *Deut 24:14-15*). Even while the laborers are still suffering, the Lord has heard (see *Exod 3:7*). • **the** Lord** of Heaven’s Armies** (*1 Sam 17:45*; *Ps 103:20-21*; *Rom 9:29*): This title emphasizes God’s power to act when the oppressed cannot.\n\n
5:6	idm167707					 **killed innocent people** (or *killed the Righteous One*): In this context, the phrase most likely refers to innocent people such as the oppressed laborers in this paragraph rather than to Jesus (cp. *Acts 3:14*; *7:52*).\n\n
5:7	idm167717					 **be patient:** This is the ultimate resolution for the poor in their economic pressures and for the unjust treatment by the wicked rich (*5:1-6*; see *2:6-7*). Even though the poor have been marginalized and oppressed, they must not give up or strike out at their oppressors. At **the Lord’s return***,* the faithful will receive their final reward (*Isa 40:10*; *Luke 6:20-35*; *1 Cor 15:23*; *1 Pet 1:17*; *5:4*; *Rev 22:12*).\n\n
5:9	idm167734					 **the Judge is standing at the door!** The coming of Christ is imminent.\n\n
5:10	idm167741					 This verse reflects on *Matt 5:11* and *Luke 6:23* (see *study note on Jas 1:22-23*).\n\n
5:11	idm167750					 **Job** was **a man of great endurance** because he remained faithful to God throughout his hardships (*Job 1:20-21*; *2:9-10*) despite his complaints (*Job 3:1-26*; *12:1-3*; *16:1-3*).\n\n
5:12	idm167763					 **never take an oath:** Because the churches were having such severe verbal conflicts (*4:1-3*, *11-12*), James calls upon them to avoid the pitfalls of deceitful oaths by not using any oaths at all (*Matt 5:33-37*). To swear an oath in the name of the Lord was to call upon him to enforce the oath (*Gen 31:53*; *1 Kgs 8:31-32*). When people swore **by heaven or earth** they were either feigning reverence while avoiding the use of the divine name, or they were being deceitful with clever verbiage (see *Matt 23:16-22*). Peter used an oath deceitfully (*Matt 26:71-73*), but Paul used an oath to confirm his assertions (*Rom 1:9*; *2 Cor 1:23*), which suggests that the prohibition of oaths is not absolute.\n\n
5:14	idm167780					 **The elders of the church** were responsible for the well-being of a local assembly of Christians. Elders were selected because of their relative age and their qualifications as Christian leaders (*Acts 14:23*; *20:17*, *28*; *1 Pet 5:1-4*; cp. *1 Tim 3:1-7*; *Titus 1:5-9*). • At this early stage in the development of the church (AD 40s; see *James Book Introduction*, “Date and Location of Writing”), the word **church** is apparently a non-technical term meaning “congregation, assembly” (cp. *Matt 18:17*). • The act of **anointing** *. . .*** with oil** symbolizes divine blessing and healing (*Isa 1:6*; *Matt 6:17*; *Mark 6:13*; *Luke 10:34*).\n\n
5:15	idm167804					 **a prayer offered in faith will heal the sick:** This proverb is a generally true statement, subject to the will of God. Only prayers that embody true *faith* will be answered affirmatively by the Lord, and faith for a particular healing is a gift that comes from God. See also *Mark 9:23*; *John 14:13-14*; *15:7*, *16*; *16:23-27*; *1 Jn 3:22*; *5:14-15*. • **if you have committed any sins:** James suggests that some illnesses might be caused by sin, and it is important that the sin also be confessed and **forgiven** (*Jas 5:16*; see *Mark 2:3-12*; *John 5:14*).\n\n
5:17	idm167824					 **Elijah . . . prayed:** See *1 Kgs 17:1*; *18:41-46*. • **Three and a half years** (see *1 Kgs 18:1*; *Luke 4:25*) is a round figure, half of seven, which symbolizes a period of judgment (cp. *Dan 12:7*; *Rev 11:2*).\n\n
5:19	idm167838					 These verses end the letter as a bookend (*inclusio*) counterbalancing the exhortation to endurance in *1:2-4*.\n\n
5:20	idm167846					 To **save** a sinner **from death** refers not merely to physical death but to eternal death, the punishment for departing from the truth of the Good News of Jesus Christ (see *1:12*, *15*; cp. *Heb 6:4-8*). If the sinful person listens and repents, eternal punishment will be averted (see also *Gal 6:1*; *Jude 1:22-24*).\n\n
