1:1	idm49195					 David had asked that the Lord be with **Solomon** (*1 Chr 22:11*) and that Solomon be strong and of good courage (*1 Chr 28:20*). David also declared that God would make Solomon great, giving strength to all Israel (*1 Chr 29:12*). Three points about Solomon echo David’s blessings: Solomon **took firm control of his kingdom***,* . . . **God was with him***,* and God **made him very powerful.**\n\n
1:2	idm49210					 Solomon’s journey to **Gibeon***,* reported in *1 Kgs 3:4*, is here elaborated. This great public venture was closely associated with Solomon taking the throne. The event included military commanders and **clan leaders**. It took place in Gibeon because the Tabernacle was there, as was the great **bronze altar** where sacrifices were regularly offered.\n\n
1:3	idm49221					 **Tabernacle:** See *study note on Exod 27:21*.\n\n
1:7	idm49229					 See “*Solomon’s Wisdom*” Theme Note.\n\n
1:10	idm49236					 Solomon received **wisdom and knowledge** so he could **govern** (Hebrew *shapat*) well. The word *shapat**,* often rendered “judge” (e.g., in Judges), can also mean “govern.”\n\n
1:14	idm49247					 The illustration of Solomon’s wealth and power (expanded on in *9:25-28*) comes from the summary of his kingdom in *1 Kgs 10:26-29*. In Kings, the summary of Solomon’s wealth provided a transition to the negative aspects of Solomon’s rule (*1 Kgs 11*). Here, Solomon’s amassing of wealth showed the fulfillment of God’s promise (*2 Chr 1:12*).\n\n
1:16	idm49257					 If **Egypt** is the correct translation, this verse indicates disobedience by Solomon (see *Deut 17:16*). However, importing from *Muzur* in Anatolia was not prohibited.\n\n
2:1	idm49266					 The **Temple** is immediately introduced as the first priority among Solomon’s building projects, although the work actually began in the fourth year of his reign (*3:2*). Solomon used the intervening years to negotiate with King Hiram (*2:3*) for materials and skilled workers.\n\n
2:5	idm49275					 **a magnificent Temple:** The greatness of the Temple and the greatness of God were not of the same order, since **not even the highest heavens can contain** God.\n\n
2:8	idm49283					 The **cedar** is *Cedrus libani* (“cedar of Lebanon”), a tree renowned for its beauty, impressive height (sometimes reaching 100 feet), and fragrant wood. Kings from Egypt, Phoenicia, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, and Greece used cedar timber **from Lebanon** for building temples and palaces. • **Red sandalwood** was used to make supports for the Temple (possibly pillars or balustrades) as well as musical instruments (see *1 Kgs 10:11*). Often mentioned in ancient writings, the exact identity of this hard, reddish-brown wood is uncertain.\n\n
2:13	idm49294					 The skill and knowledge of **Huram-abi***,* a **master** (literally *wise*) **craftsman***,* was required for building the Temple. Huram-abi had expertise in metals (**gold, silver, bronze, and iron**), in **stone and wood***,* and in textiles (**purple, blue, and scarlet cloth and fine linen**). Similarly, God had chosen Bezalel as the master craftsman of the Tabernacle and had endowed him with wisdom to carry out the work (*Exod 31:1-5*).\n\n
2:17	idm49311					 The book of Kings explains that all those left from the seven nations were conscripted for labor. Further, no Israelites were conscripted, and Israelites were placed in charge of the **laborers** (*1 Kgs 9:20-23*).\n\n
3:1	idm49319					 Although in Chronicles **the Temple** is the central topic of Solomon’s reign, attention to its actual architecture and furnishings is considerably less than that found in Kings (e.g., *1 Kgs 6:2-10*).\n\n
3:1	idm49327					 While Kings emphasizes the time when **the Temple** was built, Chronicles places great emphasis on the Temple’s building site and the significance of the location. Geographically, it was **in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah***,* the place **where the** Lord** had appeared to David***;* it was **selected** under David’s authority, and it was the sacred place where the plague was stopped at the **threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite**. Abraham bound Isaac in the land of **Moriah** (*Gen 22:2*), and tradition associated the Temple Mount as the place where the Lord provided for Abraham (*Gen 22:14*).\n\n
3:2	idm49345					 The book of Kings dates the beginning of the Temple construction in relation to the exodus from Egypt (*1 Kgs 6:1*). Chronicles consistently omits references to the Exodus, perhaps to emphasize the continuous and abiding bond between the people, the land, and God.\n\n
3:5	idm49352					 The interior of the Temple was finished with costly materials (see *1 Kgs 6:15-18*, *29*).\n\n
3:6	idm49360					 The gold from **the land of Parvaim** was the highest quality. The actual location of this place was unknown by the time of the earliest translators and might not have been known to the Chronicler either.\n\n
3:8	idm49367					 A special area was constructed at the extreme interior of the hall known as **the Most Holy Place** (the divine throne room). It might have been a sacred throne space within the long hall, or it might have been a secondary room within the main hall. The dimensions of *the Most Holy Place* were equally **30 feet** (20 cubits) in all directions. It might have rested on an elevated platform, as did the shrines of other temples, and a space might have existed between the room and the roof. *The Most Holy Place* was prepared as a repository for the Ark, which contained the terms of the covenant.\n\n
3:10	idm49377					 The **figures shaped like cherubim** were made of costly wild olive wood and were covered with gold. Similar carvings have been found in Mesopotamia, Syria, and Canaan; such figures were a distinguishing feature of ancient thrones. *Cherubim* were composite creatures signifying the union of royalty (lion) with the highest powers of strength (bull), speed (eagle), and sagacity (human). Ancient temples found in Phoenicia show the throne of the deity supported by two animals. The sides of ancient Canaanite thrones were commonly shaped as cherubs. The cherubs of Solomon’s Temple were distinct because they were not designed to serve as a human throne. They were attached to the Ark, which was the footstool to God’s throne, with the wings touching in the middle and extending to the walls of the throne room. There was no actual seat to the throne, since none was necessary.\n\n
3:15	idm49385					 The **two pillars** set in the porch of **the Temple** were made of bronze and were ornately decorated (cp. *1 Kgs 7:15-22*).\n\n
3:17	idm49394					 **Jakin** (“he establishes”) might refer to God’s promise regarding the kingdom (see *1 Chr 17:7-14*). **Boaz** (“in him is strength”) might have been a proclamation of trust in God. The gilded reliefs of cherubs, palms, and flowers adorning the doors and walls of the Temple suggest that the pillars were related to the tree of life (*Gen 2:9*).\n\n
4:2	idm49404					 The Temple, the house of God, depicted Eden, the garden of God (cp. *Isa 51:3*). The massive **Sea** that rested on the backs of the **twelve bronze oxen** represented either cosmic pre-creation waters or the waters of life that emanated from the Garden of Eden. Divine forces subdue the waters of chaos (*Gen 1:2*) so that they provide life-giving nourishment for plant, animal, and human life (see *Rev 21:1*, where the sea is removed forever).\n\n
4:6	idm49415					 The **Sea** served the same purpose as the bronze washbasin in the Tabernacle (cp. *Exod 30:18-19*).\n\n
4:7	idm49423					 The seven lights of each of the **ten gold lampstands** might have represented the Pleiades, a cluster of stars symbolized by seven dots in ancient Mesopotamia (cp. *Job 9:9*; *38:31*; *Amos 5:8*).\n\n
4:11	idm49433					 Cp. *1 Kgs 7:40b-47*, which the Chronicler follows almost verbatim.\n\n
4:19	idm49440					 The **Bread of the Presence** symbolized God’s provision for his people. It was placed before **God** on **the tables** (*4:8*) as a type of offering, demonstrating that it belonged to God and that Israel’s provision came from God’s “table.” Some of the bread was eaten by the priests (*Lev 24:5-9*), and the rest was burned; this meal symbolized the covenant meal of fellowship between God and his people (see *Exod 24:9-11*).\n\n
5:1	idm49452					 This verse concludes the section on Temple furnishings, following *1 Kgs 7:51* almost verbatim. • **the gifts his father, David, had dedicated:** Just as the spoils taken from Egypt went into building the Tabernacle, the spoils of Israel’s enemies built **the Temple**. The prophets often portrayed the spoils of other nations as being at Israel’s disposal (see *Isa 60:10-14*; *Zech 14:14*).\n\n
5:3	idm49463					 The dedication of the Temple took place during **the annual Festival of Shelters, which is held in early autumn.** This seven-day festival required a pilgrimage to the central place of worship (*Deut 16:13-15*). The seventh month marked the end of Israel’s harvest season, allowing landowners to leave for a week without concern for fields or crops.\n\n
5:5	idm49471					 **the special tent:** “Tent of Meeting” is the name used in Exodus to indicate the function of the Tabernacle (e.g., *Exod 33:7*). The Tabernacle was the dwelling place of the divine presence (e.g., *Exod 25:8-9*) and the place where God met with his people through the priests. After the Temple was built, this special tent had no further function.\n\n
5:7	idm49480					 The giant **cherubim** were symbols of the universal and eternal rule of God.\n\n
5:9	idm49487					 The Hebrew phrase **to this day** might be an idiom meaning *from then on.* The Ark was evidently not in the Temple following the Exile, when the Chronicler wrote.\n\n
5:10	idm49495					 The **Ark** contained only the **tablets** of the covenant (see *Exod 25:21*; *Deut 10:5*). The pot of manna Aaron placed in the Ark (*Exod 16:33-34*) had apparently been lost.\n\n
5:11	idm49506					 The Chronicler complements the dedication of the Temple with a detailed description of a great celebration. He names the three specific orders of **singers** and all their kinsmen. The **120 . . . trumpeters** apparently included five priests from each of the 24 divisions (*1 Chr 24:3-19*). The sanctified priests, their standard apparel of **fine linen robes***,* the musical **instruments***,* the singers, and the trumpeters were all correctly positioned. When the priests exited, the musicians raised their song, and the **cloud** of the **glorious presence of the** Lord** filled the Temple.**\n\n
6:1	idm49523					 The dedication ceremony culminated in Solomon’s poetic proclamation that expressed the most basic concept of the Temple. God had chosen to dwell in the **thick cloud of darkness**. The dedication of the Temple affirmed God’s choice of Israel as his people and his continuous presence in their midst.\n\n
6:4	idm49530					 Israel’s history as God’s people, originated at the Exodus, reached a climax when God chose **David to be king** and **Jerusalem** to be his capital. Both the **city** and the dynasty were aspects of God’s promise to David (see *1 Chr 28:4*; cp. *2 Sam 7:8-17*; *Ps 2:6-7*).\n\n
6:10	idm49542					 The Chronicler blends **the covenant** of Sinai, represented by **the Ark***,* with the Jerusalem **Temple** and the Davidic dynasty; he makes no mention of Israel’s exodus from Egypt, only implying it with reference to the Ark. God’s covenant relationship with Israel under Solomon and David formed the basis for the community’s relationship with God at the time of the Chronicler.\n\n
6:18	idm49552					 **even the highest heavens cannot contain you:** All creation can be seen as God’s true temple—the palace of the divine King (see *Isa 66:1-2*).\n\n
6:21	idm49560					 In his covenant with Israel, the Lord established blessings and life as consequences of obedience, and curses and death as consequences of disobedience (*Deut 27:11–28:68*; *30:15-18*). Solomon prayed for God to **hear . . . and forgive** when the people failed to keep God’s covenant. The seven “if-then” petitions of his prayer represented any future situation that the people of the covenant might encounter. In each case, Solomon described the situation and asked God to intervene to help his people.\n\n
6:22	idm49569					 Petition 1: Solomon asked for justice to prevail when guilt and innocence cannot easily be determined. An example of such a case would be theft (*Exod 22:7-9*); the plaintiff and the defendant would both take oaths before God, and the person determined to be guilty would pay double.\n\n
6:24	idm49576					 Petition 2: Solomon asked God to grant relief in response to repentance when sin causes misfortune. Prayer provides an opportunity for redemption, and God’s people experience his pardon through restoration.\n\n
6:26	idm49582					 Petition 3: Solomon asked that God would guide his people **to follow the right path** so that sin would not prevent God’s blessing of **rain** for the land.\n\n
6:28	idm49590					 Petition 4: Solomon showed a special sensitivity to human suffering by including both the private **sorrow** of those whose pain is hidden and the public distress of those whose pain is apparent. The prayer is personal, appealing to God’s knowledge of each individual motive. A further appeal pleads for God’s instruction so that the pain of failure might lead the individual to follow God’s ways in the future.\n\n
6:32	idm49597					 Petition 5: Solomon expressed concern for those from other nations who voluntarily joined the society of the covenant when they saw God’s blessings on those who obeyed it (*Deut 4:6-8*). These **foreigners***,* no less than native Israelites, were the object of Solomon’s prayer for mercy before God.\n\n
6:34	idm49606					 Petition 6: Solomon asked God to hear the prayers of the people when they went out at God’s command to **fight their enemies**.\n\n
6:36	idm49613					 Petition 7: Solomon’s prophetic concern that Israel might be completely exiled is evident in the final petition of his prayer. There were many exiles in the history of Israel, but complete destruction of Jerusalem and its **Temple** were the greatest challenges to faith. Solomon’s petitions looked to the Temple as a resource for faith; in a foreign land, the people might remember the chosen place and pray. The mention of land, city, and Temple (*6:38*) suggests total destruction, not partial exile. The Temple might no longer be present, but the people could still direct their prayers to God in heaven, who would hear and forgive.\n\n
6:41	idm49621					 Solomon’s prayer concludes with the quotation of a psalm (*Ps 132:8-10*). This prayer was the final part of transferring the Ark to its place in the Temple. Prayers with psalms had also accompanied David’s transfer of the Ark to Jerusalem (*1 Chr 16:7-36*); Solomon’s use of a psalm recalls the time when the Ark was first brought to its proper place. • **God** is called to **arise***,* not to war (cp. *Num 10:35*) but to his **resting place** in the Temple.\n\n
6:42	idm49634					 In harmony with the opening of the prayer (*6:15-17*), Solomon asks God to **remember** his **unfailing love for . . . David**; this refers to the covenant promise that God made to David (*1 Chr 17:4-14*; see *Isa 55:3*).\n\n
7:1	idm49645					 When the Ark was brought to its place (see *5:13-14*), **the glorious presence of the** Lord descended on the Temple. The divine glory remained in the Temple, preventing **the priests** from entering to perform their service (see “*The Glory of God*” Theme Note and “*God’s Glory with His People*” Theme Note).\n\n
7:4	idm49657					 The offering of **sacrifices** was essential to dedicate the dwelling of the Most High on earth; the sacrifices also provided food for the people during the fifteen days of celebration. The numbers of animals sacrificed match those found in *1 Kgs 8:63*.\n\n
7:8	idm49665					 **Lebo-hamath in the north and the Brook of Egypt in the south** marked the boundaries of Israel as promised to the patriarchs (*Gen 15:18*; *Num 34:5*, *8*; *Josh 15:4*). The Temple dedication festival preceded the annual Festival of Shelters, which ended on the twenty-second day of the month.\n\n
7:13	idm49676					 These verses refer directly to Solomon’s prayer (see *6:26*, *28*, *40*). God outlined for Solomon the requirements for rescue from judgment. In Solomon’s prayer, each case had been addressed separately; in the Lord’s answer, the required response is developed more generally and comprehensively. The people need humility, repentance, seeking the Lord, and prayer in order to be healed from their distresses.\n\n
7:17	idm49685					 God declared to Solomon that God’s Kingdom is eternal. Where *1 Kgs 9:5* states that one of his descendants will always be on the throne of Israel, the Chronicler says, **One of your descendants will always rule over Israel.** In the days of the Chronicler there was no throne in Israel, so his statement alludes to the Messiah (cp. *Mic 5:2*).\n\n
7:19	idm49694					 Despite its magnificence, the Temple did become **an object of mockery and ridicule** when the people of Israel turned away from the Lord; the Temple was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BC.\n\n
8:2	idm49702					 The twenty **towns** that Solomon had given Hiram in exchange for gold were unsatisfactory to Hiram (*1 Kgs 9:11-14*); this implies that Hiram gave them back to Solomon, who apparently provided other compensation.\n\n
8:3	idm49710					 This verse is the only reference in Chronicles of Solomon’s military accomplishments; he was known as a man of peace (*1 Chr 22:9*). The kingdoms of David and Solomon extended to **Hamath-zobah** in the far north on the Orontes River. King Toi, the ruler of Hamath, sought David’s support against Hadadezer, king of Zobah (*1 Chr 18:9-10*). Hadadezer was also referred to as the king of Zobah-Hamath (*1 Chr 18:3*). Solomon conducted an expedition against this territory to maintain the stability of his kingdom’s northern border.\n\n
8:4	idm49720					 The Chronicler describes the northern reaches of Solomon’s kingdom. **Tadmor** later became Palmyra, an oasis city in Syria along the desert trade routes with Mesopotamia, 120 miles northeast of Damascus. It is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. At some point, it came to be identified with the list of fortified cities in Solomon’s kingdom (cp. *1 Kgs 9:18*, where Tamar/Tadmor indicates a city in southeast Judah).\n\n
8:5	idm49728					 **Upper** and **Lower Beth-horon** sit astride a ridge rising from the Valley of Aijalon to the plateau north of Jerusalem. Fortifications protected the route connecting Jerusalem to the major coastal trade route.\n\n
8:6	idm49736					 Some cities were used for storage and for military cavalry. Large building complexes at Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer contained long rooms divided into three sections with two rows of pillars. They might have been used as stables and storehouses, or they might have provided barracks for a professional army.\n\n
8:11	idm49742					 Solomon’s alliance with Egypt through his marriage to Pharaoh’s daughter is mentioned repeatedly in Kings (*1 Kgs 3:1*; *9:16*, *24*; *11:1*). Solomon’s ability to marry into the Egyptian royal family shows the extent of his kingdom and international influence. Solomon provided her with a permanent personal residence to show that he regarded her as the most important of his wives. It also preserved the sanctity of **David’s palace***,* probably because Pharaoh’s daughter was pagan.\n\n
8:17	idm49754					 By discussing Solomon’s activities at his kingdom’s most northern and southern borders, the Chronicler shows the extent of Solomon’s empire. Solomon controlled **ports** on **the Red Sea** that provided for international trade to the south. • **Hiram** was a valuable ally; his people, the Phoenicians of Tyre, had extensive trade networks and were expert mariners, helping **Solomon** trade with Ophir. • **Ophir** is traditionally thought to be in southwest Arabia (see *Gen 10:28-29*).\n\n
9:1	idm49766					 Although Solomon had long-term economic and political ties with Hiram of Tyre (*8:17-18*; *9:10-11*), the **queen of Sheba** visited just once. Ancient Sheba (roughly modern Yemen) was noted for its important female rulers and for a wealthy economy based on trade in frankincense and myrrh. An ancient tradition suggests that the queen of Sheba came from Cush (Ethiopia), perhaps because of Sheba son of Raamah, a descendant of Cush (*Gen 10:7*; *1 Chr 1:9*).\n\n
9:3	idm49777					 The queen observed the unusual grandeur of Solomon’s court, which demonstrated both his wealth and his wisdom.\n\n
9:9	idm49783					 **9,000 pounds:** The queen presented Solomon with **gold** that equaled the amount he had received from Hiram (cp. *1 Kgs 9:14*). • The queen’s gift of **spices***,* such as frankincense and myrrh, were used in cosmetics, for embalming, and for religious offerings. High demand and repeated taxation over the long trade route made the spices as valuable as gold in gifts to a king (see *Matt 2:11*). Solomon was so wealthy that the queen had to give an enormous gift for it to be regarded as significant.\n\n
9:13	idm49795					 The phrase translated **each year** can also refer to one particular year, making it unclear whether **25 tons** referred to Solomon’s annual income or only to his most profitable year. Solomon also collected taxes from foreign **traders** and local **merchants**. The **kings of Arabia** were probably merchant princes who used the routes from Edom to Damascus, while the **governors of the provinces** were district officials.\n\n
9:15	idm49807					 Ornamental and ceremonial **shields** were common in ancient Syria and Assyria. Large shields were full-body length and possibly three-sided; small shields, worn on the arm, provided light protection. Guards displayed their shields as **the king** went up to the Temple.\n\n
9:17	idm49815					 Solomon’s **throne** was very grand. There were **six steps,** and the throne might have stood on a platform that made a seventh step; similar Babylonian temple towers were built in seven stages to represent the entire cosmos.\n\n
9:21	idm49823					 Solomon’s **fleet of trading ships of Tarshish** was used to transport cargo. The peculiar shape of these strong ships allowed them to sail long distances in the open sea. • **and peacocks:** The meaning of the Hebrew word is uncertain. Solomon was so great that he imported fine goods and exotic animals from the farthest reaches of the known world.\n\n
9:29	idm49831					 The Chronicler apparently used prophetic anthologies or annals as part of his source material; the works of individual prophets may have been incorporated into larger collections. These sources no longer exist. **Nathan** and **Ahijah** were active during the reigns of David and Solomon. **Iddo** is otherwise unknown.\n\n
9:30	idm49840					 **Solomon** reigned from 971 to 931 BC.\n\n
10:1	idm49848					 **Shechem** was in the heart of the territory of the northern tribes; the need for **Rehoboam** to go there for confirmation reflects either weak national unity or the comparative strength and influence of the northern tribes. • **Rehoboam** reigned from 931 to 913 BC.\n\n
10:2	idm49858					 **Jeroboam . . . had fled to Egypt to escape from King Solomon:** See *1 Kgs 11:26-40*. Jeroboam **returned from Egypt** at the news of Solomon’s death.\n\n
10:4	idm49867					 Rehoboam was not powerful enough to enforce taxation over the northern tribes, so they demanded concessions to remain under his rule.\n\n
10:6	idm49873					 The **older men** of Israel were distinguished from officials, nobles, and guardians (*Judg 8:14*; *1 Kgs 21:8*; *2 Kgs 10:5*) who had official government roles. These elders traditionally exercised considerable influence in royal decisions. When Ben-hadad, king of Aram, attacked Samaria, the elders of Samaria were decisive in rejecting his harsh terms of surrender (*1 Kgs 20:7-9*). Earlier, when Absalom revolted against David, the elders of Israel were influential in critical decisions (*2 Sam 17:4*, *15*; *19:11*).\n\n
10:8	idm49887					 **Rehoboam** was forty-one years old when he began to reign (*12:13*), so the **young men who had grown up with him** were not novices. They might have been royal princes, sons of Solomon’s other wives. It was natural for them to have a role in Rehoboam’s government, as shown by his promotion of his son Abijah (*11:22*). Referring to these princes as “young” might have been a comment on the value of their advice, because the young were not viewed as being wise (see *Job 12:12*).\n\n
10:10	idm49898					 The words of the younger counselors corresponded with Rehoboam’s disposition. They lacked the experience of the elders, but they shared Rehoboam’s inclinations and preferences. They delivered their answer in metaphors and rhetoric appropriate to a royal court.\n\n
10:16	idm49904					 The people **responded** using words that were the converse of a poetic saying the Chronicler had used earlier (*1 Chr 12:18*); there, the people of the southern tribes of Benjamin and Judah (*1 Chr 12:16*) showed growing support for **David**.\n\n
10:18	idm49914					 **Rehoboam** came to Shechem to be anointed king but barely escaped with his life. His poor understanding of the situation was particularly evident when he sent a civilian official, rather than an army commander, to enforce conscription.\n\n
11:1	idm49921					 Shemaiah’s prophetic intervention averted immediate civil war among Israel’s tribes, but the summary of **Rehoboam** characterizes his reign as one of continual warfare with Jeroboam (*12:15*). Civil war characterized the first fifty years of the divided kingdom, until the time of Omri.\n\n
11:5	idm49929					 The Lord’s blessing on Rehoboam is demonstrated in his building activities, the defection of the faithful priests from the north to the south, the migration of the faithful in the north to Jerusalem, and his large family.\n\n
11:5	idm49935					 **Rehoboam . . . fortified various towns** to defend **Judah** from east, south, and west, protecting the valleys leading into the Judean hill country and the important crossroads. Rehoboam’s first task was to strengthen a minimal but defensible position. The defensive lines made strategic sense against an Egyptian attack, and likely began before the invasion of Pharaoh Shishak (926/925 BC).\n\n
11:9	idm49944					 **Lachish** formed the pivotal southwestern corner of Rehoboam’s fortifications, guarding the road to the coastal highway to the west, a primary route that Egypt could use to attack from the south.\n\n
11:13	idm49951					 The apostasy that Jeroboam initiated in the north (see *1 Kgs 12:26-33*) led **those who sincerely wanted to worship the** Lord to emigrate to the south. **Rehoboam** followed the Lord faithfully **for three years***,* but he was unfaithful in the fourth year of his reign (*2 Chr 12:1*). God then immediately punished Rehoboam by sending Shishak to invade from Egypt (*12:2-5*).\n\n
11:15	idm49965					 Some scholars believe that Jeroboam set up the **goat and calf idols** as pedestals for the Lord, noting that the Canaanites believed that their gods stood on the backs of animals (cp. *Exod 32:5*, where the gold calf was used in “a festival to the Lord”). However, Jeroboam never specifically credited the Lord with rescuing Israel (*1 Kgs 12:28*), so others think he might have meant that other gods stood on the animals. Still others think Jeroboam might have adopted the practice of the Egyptians, portraying actual pagan deities in animal form (cp. *Exod 32:4*).\n\n
11:18	idm49976					 The numbers of Rehoboam’s wives and children are probably the total from his entire reign rather than those accumulated by his fifth year. **Rehoboam** loved his second wife more than his first, so he violated the right of primogeniture (inheritance belonging to the firstborn son, *Deut 21:15-17*) by making **Abijah . . . the next king** in what might have been co-regency. This action secured an orderly succession.\n\n
11:23	idm49985					 Rehoboam’s delegation of control to the royal princes extended the reign of the royal family into outlying districts. This provided for a smooth transition of power and also made a revolt or attempted coup less likely. Perhaps this was Rehoboam’s conscious attempt to avoid troubles that God had promised David’s house (*2 Sam 12:10-11*).\n\n
12:1	idm49992					 The book of Kings states no theological reason for Egypt’s invasion, but the Chronicler does: The Egyptians **attacked Jerusalem** because **Rehoboam** had **abandoned** the covenant and rebelled against **the** Lord.\n\n
12:2	idm50003					 **Shishak,** also known as Shoshenq I (945–924 BC), ruled a reunited **Egypt** and founded the 22nd dynasty.\n\n
12:3	idm50013					 **Sukkites** are not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible but are known from Egyptian history as Libyans from the oases of the western desert. • **and Ethiopians:** Shishak was an Ethiopian from southern Egypt.\n\n
12:6	idm50021					 Shemaiah’s speech expresses the elements required in Solomon’s prayer at the dedication of the Temple (*7:14*). **The leaders of Israel . . . humbled themselves***,* and the wrath of judgment was removed from **Jerusalem**.\n\n
12:9	idm50031					 The looting of the royal **treasuries** and of the **Temple** were the punishment **Rehoboam** received for his disobedience. The **gold shields** were ritually carried by **the guard** accompanying **the king** when he moved from the palace to the Temple. The royal processionals lost much of their splendor with the **bronze shields** (cp. *9:15-16*), which were safely stored in the huge armory Solomon had built (*8:6*).\n\n
12:12	idm50046					 When **Rehoboam** repented, God allowed **good things** to remain in Jerusalem: the repentance of the people, their resolve to seek the Lord, and the preservation of worship (see *19:3*).\n\n
13:1	idm50055					 **Abijah** is called Abijam in Kings (e.g., *1 Kgs 15:1*). Abijam, possibly the Canaanite form of his name, would mean “my father is *Yam.*” Yam was the Canaanite sea-god prominent in the Baal stories (see *study note on Job 7:12*). *Abijah* means “my father is *Yah,*” the usual short form for Yahweh, the God of Judah. Abijah reigned from 913 to 910 BC.\n\n
13:2	idm50068					 The ongoing conflict between Rehoboam and **Jeroboam** (see *12:15*) carried into the reign of **Abijah**. Abijah might have been attempting to reunite north and south, as is suggested by his speech (*13:5-12*). The large numbers of soldiers on each side correspond approximately to David’s census (*2 Sam 24:9*); Israel’s double number of soldiers magnifies God’s intervention on behalf of Judah (*2 Chr 13:14-19*).\n\n
13:4	idm50080					 **Mount Zemaraim:** The town of that name was on the northern border of Benjamin (see *Josh 18:22*), about five miles northeast of Bethel. Benjamin was a buffer and a battleground between the northern and southern kingdoms.\n\n
13:5	idm50088					 **a lasting covenant:** Literally *a covenant of salt.* Salt was required with a grain offering (*Lev 2:13*). The social and religious background for this phrase is unknown. However, salt was used as a preservative and provided an apt metaphor for a permanent covenant.\n\n
13:6	idm50097					 Abijah’s speech castigated the northerners for refusing to support the kingdom of David.\n\n
13:8	idm50103					 Abijah’s speech made two key points about the rebellion of the north: The north rejected the only legitimate king, and they rejected the only legitimate place of worship. The revolt of the northerners, who **chased away** the proper priestly order, is sharply contrasted with “us” (*13:10*). Most objectionable was the worship of the calves and the role of the unauthorized **priests.**\n\n
13:10	idm50112					 Abijah’s speech portrays him as concerned about the purity of worship at Jerusalem. The account in Kings says nothing of Abijah’s devotion (*1 Kgs 15:3-4*).\n\n
13:13	idm50119					 The example of God’s people turning to him and his helping them, even after the kingdom had been disrupted, provided hope for the original readers in a similar situation.\n\n
13:19	idm50125					 The Lord granted the kingdom of Judah a miraculous victory. **Abijah** took the territories surrounding **Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron** from Israel (*13:19*). Together with Zemaraim (*13:4*), these towns in the hill country on the northern border of Judah formed a geographical unit (see *Josh 18:22-23*). The subsequent history of this territorial gain is not known; by the time of Amos (about 760 BC), Bethel was a major pagan shrine in Israel.\n\n
13:20	idm50137					 **Jeroboam** outlived **Abijah** (see *1 Kgs 15:9*). The report of his death is included with his defeat, which was typical of vanquished warriors (see *2 Kgs 19:37*).\n\n
14:1	idm50147					 **Asa** reigned from 910 to 869 BC.\n\n
14:2	idm50155					 At the beginning of his reign, **Asa . . . removed the foreign altars** in Judah (*14:5*). However, he did not remove the pagan shrines from Israel (*15:17*). These were probably in the cities of the northern kingdom that Asa had inherited from Abijah. Idolatry practiced by other peoples occupying the land plagued Judah throughout its history; this pagan activity might have revived toward the end of Asa’s reign more than thirty years later.\n\n
14:4	idm50164					 The phrase **seek the** Lord is the Chronicler’s formula for restoration; it both highlights and critiques Asa’s reign (see *15:2*, *12-13*; *16:12*).\n\n
14:7	idm50175					 Solomon had prayed that the Lord would hear his people when they were led into battle (*6:34*). In the battle against **Zerah***,* God responded to such a prayer. • **Ethiopian** (literally “Cushite”) might refer to someone from southern Egypt (Nubia) or a Midianite territory northeast of Aqabah (see *Num 12:1*; *Hab 3:7*). However, the mention of Libya in *2 Chr 16:8*, the size of the battle (comparable to the attack of Shishak against Rehoboam in *12:3*), and the location of Mareshah in the west of Judah indicate that Zerah was an Egyptian; he is otherwise unknown. He might have been a Nubian general dispatched by Osorkon I, the Libyan pharaoh who ruled Egypt between the tenth and fourteenth years of Asa (900–897 BC). Another view is that Shishak established a buffer state around Gerar, supported by Nubian mercenaries that invaded Judah. The account, however, only says that Asa and his armies pursued the armies south to **Gerar** and took a **vast amount of plunder***,* particularly from the herdsmen living in tents around the cities.\n\n
15:1	idm50193					 The prophet **Azariah** is unknown outside of this passage. His speech to **King Asa** and the **people of Judah** also served as the Chronicler’s own message to the people of Judah following the Exile: **The** Lord will be with his people, he will be found by those who **seek him***,* and he will reward their obedience.\n\n
15:3	idm50206					 The **dark times***,* described as resulting from the lack of knowing God (cp. *Hos 3:4-5*), seem best to fit the period of the judges.\n\n
15:5	idm50215					 **it was not safe to travel:** Cp. *Judg 5:6-8*; *Zech 8:10*.\n\n
15:7	idm50224					 The exhortation to **be strong and courageous** is a literal quotation of the exhortation that both Moses and Joshua gave Israel when they were first entering the land (*Deut 31:6-7*; *Josh 1:6*, *9*, *18*).\n\n
15:8	idm50235					 The Chronicler described Asa’s response in the precise terms of the prophet’s exhortation, but Asa’s specific actions went far beyond its general directives. As soon as Asa heard the prophetic words, **he took courage** in initiating a comprehensive reform, beginning with the removal of the **detestable idols** that again infested the land (see *14:5*). Full trust in God had won the war against the Cushites, and total renewal of the covenant brought the Promised Land to rest (*15:15*).\n\n
15:8	idm50245					 The **towns he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim** were those conquered in his war with Baasha (*16:1*). There was continuous warfare between Baasha and Asa (see *1 Kgs 15:16*).\n\n
15:9	idm50254					 **the people of Ephraim, Manasseh:** The Chronicler always included the northern tribes in his accounts of spiritual reform (cp. *30:1-11*). • The territory of **Simeon** was absorbed into **Judah**.\n\n
15:10	idm50264					 The ceremony of covenant renewal in the third month was probably during the Festival of Harvest (Pentecost). This great festival brought crowds to the Temple from all the surrounding regions. Disloyalty to the covenant was regarded as treason and carried the ultimate penalty (*Deut 17:2-7*). The sacrifices were dedicated offerings from the victory over Zerah (*2 Chr 14:15*).\n\n
15:16	idm50272					 The **queen mother** was the first lady of the realm, usually holding the office as long as she lived. When she died, the title passed to the mother of the heir apparent. There is no indication that the *queen mother* held official duties, but she wielded considerable influence. • **Asherah** is well known from Canaanite literature as the wife of the god El and the mother of seventy children, including Baal. The image made of her quite possibly had prominent sexual characteristics, a common attribute of Canaanite images. • **his grandmother:** Literally *his mother.* The term “mother” can be used generically for any female ancestor. See *11:20*, where Maacah is listed as the mother of Abijah (Asa’s father).\n\n
15:19	idm50284					 **no more war:** Literally *no war*. Most translations, including the NLT, add “more” to assist in conveying the probable meaning. But if “no war” is in fact the better reading, **the thirty-fifth year** might refer to the thirty-fifth year since the division of the northern and southern kingdoms. That would have been around the time when Zerah the Ethiopian invaded Judah and was defeated by Asa (*14:9-15*). But see the *study note on 16:1*. • The Chronicler inserts chronological notes into his account to divide Asa’s reign into periods that show the consequences of his decisions (see *14:1*; *15:10*; *16:1*, *12*, *13*). The early battles with the north were seen as inconsequential for that period, though the Chronicler was fully aware of them (see *15:8*). The first years of **Asa’s reign** were characterized by divine favor to an obedient king.\n\n
16:1	idm50302					 Instead of trusting the Lord, Asa relied on foreign powers when Baasha attacked. The Chronicler’s theological purpose was to show that disobedience has consequences.\n\n
16:1	idm50308					 **In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign:** According to the book of Kings, **King Baasha** (909–886 BC) died in the twenty-sixth year of **Asa’s reign** (*1 Kgs 16:8*). One solution is that the Chronicles text might contain transmission errors and should instead read the fifteenth and sixteenth years (about 895 BC) instead of the thirty-fifth (*2 Chr 15:19*) and *thirty-sixth* years of Asa. Another possibility is that the Chronicler counted these years from the division of the kingdom. • **Ramah** was located five miles north of Jerusalem near Geba and Mizpah (see *16:6*). **King Baasha** expanded **Israel** deep into the territory of Benjamin, separating important territory from Judah very shortly after the victories of Abijah (*13:19*).\n\n
16:2	idm50327					 To obtain relief from Baasha’s aggression, **Asa** bribed the Arameans with **silver and gold from . . . the Temple***,* appealing to an earlier treaty that his father Abijah had made with them.\n\n
16:4	idm50336					 King **Ben-hadad** of Aram (*16:2*) broke his treaty with Baasha and attacked northern Israel, capturing all the land of **Naphtali;** this area included all of Galilee and nearly all of the country north of the Jezreel Valley and east of the Sea of Galilee. • **Ijon** was a large village in the southern Beqa‘ Valley, on the southern border of modern-day Lebanon. This town is usually listed with **Dan** (Laish), **Abel-beth-maacah,** and Hazor in northern Israel. *Abel-beth-maacah* was near a major waterfall of the Jordan River tributaries, at the juncture of the Hula Valley and the Beqa‘ Valley in Lebanon.\n\n
16:6	idm50349					 **Asa** drafted laborers to use the materials from **Ramah** to fortify the northern border of his kingdom. **Mizpah** is usually identified with Tell en-Nasba, about four miles north of Ramah and two miles from Bethel. **Geba** was probably located three miles beyond the watershed east of Gibeah, protecting a wadi leading down to Jericho and the sanctuary at Gilgal.\n\n
16:7	idm50359					 **Hanani the seer** announced to Asa that he would suffer war from then on as a consequence of his disobedience. This judgment was a clear antithesis to Asa’s earlier victory over Zerah, when the odds were against him but he trusted in the Lord (*14:9-13*). Just as Asa’s previous reliance on the Lord had brought the land peace (*14:5*), his reliance on military power now destined him to continual warfare.\n\n
16:10	idm50368					 Asa’s infidelity to the Lord in relying on power resulted in other sins, including oppression of the prophet and the people.\n\n
16:12	idm50374					 Sickness was often seen as punishment for sin (see *21:18-19*; *26:20*).\n\n
16:14	idm50382					 Asa had an honorable burial despite his sins. He had made extravagant preparations for his burial during his lifetime, including a **tomb he had carved out for himself**. Asa might have been imitating the pharaohs of Egypt in making these preparations. • The custom of **a huge funeral fire** is unknown outside of Chronicles and Jeremiah (cp. *Jer 34:5*).\n\n
17:1	idm50391					 Including a two-year co-regency with his father, Asa, **Jehoshaphat** reigned from 872 to 848 BC. • The last years of Asa’s reign were characterized by conflicts and oppression, so Jehoshaphat needed to consolidate power within Judah to restore peace and stability. Israel had been an enemy during Asa’s days, but Jehoshaphat soon entered into an alliance with Ahab (*18:1-2*).\n\n
17:3	idm50400					 For the first time, the Chronicler compares Judah’s practices with those of northern Israel, showing his awareness that the Baal cult from Tyre had been introduced into northern worship (see *1 Kgs 16:31-32*).\n\n
17:5	idm50407					 The word translated **gifts** is usually translated “tribute,” such as conquering kings required of their vassals (e.g., *Judg 3:15-18*), but forced tribute is hardly the sense intended here. The people of Judah voluntarily made Jehoshaphat **very wealthy**. As with Uzziah (*2 Chr 26:16*) and Hezekiah (*32:25*), riches often result in pride. However, Jehoshaphat **was deeply committed to the ways of the** Lord. He was not proud of his own achievements; instead, his courage led him to remove idolatrous worship from the kingdom. **Jehoshaphat** established control within his kingdom by practicing righteousness and faithfulness to God.\n\n
17:7	idm50421					 **Jehoshaphat** carried out the Lord’s requirement to know the law (*Deut 5:1*; *17:18-20*), commissioning five royal officers, nine **Levites***,* and two **priests** to instruct the people in the book of the covenant. Levites frequently functioned as teachers during the Second Temple period as well (*Neh 8:7*). • Some versions omit **Tob-adonijah***;* it appears to be a scribal error of repetition.\n\n
17:10	idm50436					 The **fear of the** Lord among the **surrounding kingdoms** resulted in **tribute** to Jehoshaphat, an action that was intended to buy peace. Peace is one indicator of divine favor (cp. *14:2-6*). • The **Arabs** were probably the desert tribes living south of Judah in territory next to the Philistines.\n\n
17:12	idm50448					 Jehoshaphat’s international status, building enterprises, and army characterized his great rule. Archaeological excavations have revealed a line of highway forts in the Jordan Valley near the Dead Sea dating to his time. • The number of troops in his army—totaling more than a million in Jerusalem—seems unreasonably high. Because the leaders were based on tribal divisions (*17:14*), it is possible that the term translated as “thousand” (*’elep*) should instead be translated as “squad” or “platoon,” a much smaller military unit. The totals might also include reserve divisions that served on rotation (see *1 Chr 27:1-15*). The number of troops credited to Jehoshaphat is approximately triple those of Abijah (*2 Chr 13:3*), Asa (*14:8*), Amaziah (*25:5*), and Uzziah (*26:11-15*). It is comparable to the number of warriors at the time of David’s census (*1 Chr 21:5*), when soldiers from the northern tribes were counted. A large army was an indication of God’s blessing.\n\n
18:1	idm50462					 Jehoshaphat’s **alliance with Ahab** led him to compromise his faithfulness to the Lord (see *19:2-3*; cp. *2 Cor 6:14-18*). The marriage of his son Jehoram (*2 Chr 21:1*) to **Ahab’s daughter** Athaliah (*22:2*) brought Israel’s apostasy into Judah (see *21:5-6*, *12-13*; *22:1-4*).\n\n
18:5	idm50477					 The 400 **prophets** were Ahab’s “yes-men.” **Jehoshaphat** wanted instead to hear from **a prophet of the** Lord*,* but Ahab knew in advance that such a prophet would contradict his court prophets.\n\n
18:15	idm50488					 Ahab understood that Micaiah had not spoken the word of the Lord, perhaps because Micaiah’s answer used the same words as that of his rivals, or Micaiah might have been speaking with a sarcastic tone (*18:14*).\n\n
18:18	idm50495					 The vision explains the deception of the false prophets while legitimizing Micaiah’s word. The deception guaranteed that Ahab would fall in battle; his judgment was decreed.\n\n
18:25	idm50501					 Ahab’s defiance against the Lord is seen in his contempt for Micaiah, the Lord’s prophet.\n\n
18:28	idm50507					 Although Ahab knew he had gone against God’s will and was therefore liable for the consequences, his immediate concern was the Aramean army. His belief that he could defy God’s judgment against him indicates his disregard for the Lord; his error was fatal.\n\n
19:1	idm50513					 **Jehu** was the **son of Hanani,** the prophet who had rebuked Asa for his reliance on the Arameans (*16:7-9*). Jehu now chastised Jehoshaphat for his alliance with Ahab. • The word **love** expresses faithfulness to a covenant. Jehoshaphat’s covenant with **the wicked** Ahab conflicted with his covenant with the Lord.\n\n
19:4	idm50524					 In Jehoshaphat’s judicial reform, he appointed **judges** in the **fortified towns** (*19:5*) and in a central court **in Jerusalem** (*19:8*). He exhorted all the judges to **think carefully***,* and to **judge with integrity** and **in the fear of the** Lord. This excluded acting with any **partiality** or **taking of bribes***,* and included warning criminals **not to sin against the** Lord. The reform reestablished the law of Deuteronomy (*Deut 16:18–17:13*).\n\n
20:1	idm50546					 **Meunites** (see *1 Chr 4:41*): The Meunites were a nomadic group living on the southern borders of Judah; their name probably survives as the Arab town of Ma’an, twelve miles southeast of Petra.\n\n
20:2	idm50554					 Translating the word as **Edom** instead of *Aram* is consistent with the Chronicler’s later description of the armies (*20:10*, *22-23*) and with the geographical description of the attack from the southeast through **En-gedi**. (Aram was northeast of Judah.)\n\n
20:3	idm50565					 **Jehoshaphat** responded to the news of war with neighboring nations with a prayer of lament, keeping with the ideals of Solomon’s prayer (*6:24-40*).\n\n
20:10	idm50573					 **Mount Seir** was another name for Edom (see *Gen 32:3* and *the study note on Gen 25:25*).\n\n
20:14	idm50582					 Following Jehoshaphat’s lament, Jahaziel’s proclamation of rescue fulfilled the requirements for the speech that a priest was to give before battle (*Deut 20:2-4*).\n\n
20:20	idm50589					 The song of the **appointed singers** replaced a battle cry. The **prophets** were Jahaziel (*20:14-17*) and the Levitical musicians (*20:21*), whose musical praise for the battle march was a prophecy, a declaration that God was at the head of the army.\n\n
20:32	idm50599					 The comparison of **Jehoshaphat** with **Asa** is adopted from *1 Kgs 22:43* without alteration.\n\n
20:35	idm50608					 The Lord destroyed the **fleet** to prevent Jehoshaphat’s **alliance with King Ahaziah of Israel** from prospering.\n\n
21:2	idm50616					 **Jehoram***,* whose wife was Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel (*18:1*; *21:6*; *22:2*), was the first king of David’s line to receive a totally negative evaluation. His murders (*21:4*) seriously threatened the continuation of the dynasty, which was only preserved because of the Lord’s own loyal faithfulness to David (*21:7*). On three other occasions, violence was perpetrated against the royal family that all but ended the dynasty (see *21:17*; *22:8-9*, *10-11*).\n\n
21:5	idm50632					 After a three-year co-regency with his father, **Jehoram** reigned from 848 to 841 BC.\n\n
21:8	idm50640					 **Jehoram’s** disobedience caused him to lose the gains that Asa and Jehoshaphat had won. • **the Edomites revolted:** During Solomon’s reign, control of the territory of Edom gave Israel access to the rich trade from Arabia. The Edomites had also rebelled before Solomon’s death (*1 Kgs 11:14-22*), and were probably not under Rehoboam’s control. They apparently came under Judah’s control again following their defeat by Jehoshaphat (*2 Chr 20:1-30*; cp. *1 Kgs 22:47*). • The **town of Libnah** was at the western end of the valley of Elah, on the border of the territory of the Philistines.\n\n
21:12	idm50652					 The letter from **Elijah the prophet** to **Jehoram** announced judgment for his disobedience.\n\n
21:16	idm50660					 Jehoram’s inability to resist the initial revolts of Edom and Libnah (*21:8-10*) encouraged other attacks on Judah, this time by **the Philistines and the Arabs**. Once again, the royal line was nearly destroyed.\n\n
21:18	idm50668					 **Jehoram** died after a long and painful bowel disease. He was not given the dignity of an honorary funeral rite (see *16:14*) and was buried in disgrace away from the **royal cemetery**.\n\n
22:2	idm50677					 The queen mother, **Athaliah***,* exercised significant influence over the king (see *study note on 15:16*). Athaliah was very much like her mother, Jezebel (see *22:10–23:15*; cp. *1 Kgs 16:31–21:28*), and she followed in the footsteps of her grandfather **Omri** (see *1 Kgs 16:21-26*).\n\n
22:2	idm50690					 **one year:** Ahaziah, also known as Jehoahaz, reigned briefly over Judah in 841 BC.\n\n
22:5	idm50698					 **Ramoth-gilead***,* a Levitical city in the territory of Gad (*Josh 21:38*), was located on a major trade route and was strategic for **Aram** and **Israel**. • **Jezreel***,* at the foot of Mount Gilboa in the plain of Jezreel, became the summer home of the Israelite kings.\n\n
22:7	idm50711					 The death of **Ahaziah** was a punishment for his alliance with the king of Israel. The Judahite king who lived by the counsel of the Israelite house of Omri shared their fate and found no refuge there at the time of his death. Ahaziah’s infidelity brought David’s line almost to the same point as Saul’s line, with no one left to assume the throne.\n\n
22:10	idm50718					 **Athaliah** was never regarded as a legitimate monarch; she was given no royal formula of age or length of reign as were other rulers. Her destruction of **the rest of Judah’s royal family** concentrated on potential male successors; those who were ineligible to reign, such as **Ahaziah’s sister***,* survived the slaughter. **Jehosheba** was Ahaziah’s half sister, **the daughter of King Jehoram** by a wife other than Athaliah. The **six years** of Athaliah’s reign were from 841 to 835 BC.\n\n
23:1	idm50732					 **Jehoiada . . . made a pact** or covenant with key military officers, who solicited broad popular support among **the Levites and clan leaders**. The content of the people’s **pact with Joash** was expressed in Jehoiada’s declaration that the son of the king must become king.\n\n
23:4	idm50741					 The most logical time for the coup was at the changing of the Temple guard, when there would be large movements of people. A third of the guards were coming on duty; they were stationed in three locations to perform their regular duties and to watch for any activity from the palace. The remainder of the armed force was stationed in **the courtyards of the** Lord**’s Temple***,* providing a human wall to protect the king.\n\n
23:6	idm50751					 Because **only the priests and Levites on duty may enter the Temple***,* the Levites were required to prevent anyone else from doing so.\n\n
23:11	idm50759					 When the seven-year-old **Joash** was anointed and crowned as **king***,* he was given a copy of the law, as the law commanded (see *Deut 17:18-20*).\n\n
23:16	idm50769					 The **covenant** included vows between **the king and the people***,* between the Lord and the king, and between the Lord and the people. The vows with the Lord included eliminating the worship of **Baal**.\n\n
23:18	idm50779					 By arranging for Joash to take the throne, **Jehoiada** the priest restored David’s dynasty and reinstituted Temple worship according to **directions given by David**.\n\n
24:1	idm50787					 **Joash** reigned from 835 to 796 BC.\n\n
24:3	idm50795					 **Jehoiada chose two wives for Joash***,* probably to ensure that David’s royal line would be replenished with plenty of descendants.\n\n
24:4	idm50803					 There is no indication regarding when **Joash** first attempted to refurbish **the Temple**. However, after the first failure to raise funds, Joash summoned **Jehoiada** a second time, in the twenty-third year of his reign (*2 Kgs 12:6*). The inaction of the priests might have resulted from a disagreement over who should fund the restoration work and who should oversee it. The king censured Jehoiada for his failure to act and then proposed a plan that put the offering on a more voluntary basis.\n\n
24:12	idm50813					 The book of Kings indicates that the funds collected for repairing the Temple were used only for wages (*2 Kgs 12:13-14*); Chronicles further explains that the funds were used for Temple artifacts only after the repairs were completed.\n\n
24:15	idm50820					 A lifespan of **130** years indicates that **Jehoiada** received great blessing by the Lord. Further, his royal burial as a priest-king shows great honor from the people.\n\n
24:20	idm50828					 **Jehoiada** had scrupulously preserved **the courtyard of the** Lord**’s Temple** from bloodshed and the dynasty of David from extinction. Yet ironically, **Zechariah** his son was murdered in the very place and by the very king, **Joash***,* who was protected during the coup. Jesus made reference to this murder when he was criticizing the religious leaders (*Matt 23:35*; *Luke 11:51*). • **“May the** Lord** . . . avenge my death!”** This prayer for vengeance was similar to those that King David himself had prayed against the injustices done to him by Saul (cp. *Pss 5:10*; *7:9*; *9:19-20*; *28:4*; *56:7*; *139:19*; see also “*Prayers for Vengeance*” Theme Note).\n\n
24:23	idm50853					 God could use war to render judgment on Israel just as surely as on any other nation; one of the characteristics of a “holy war” was a small force’s defeat of a much larger army.\n\n
24:25	idm50859					 **Jehoiada** had received a royal burial (*24:15-16*), but **Joash** was buried in disgrace.\n\n
24:27	idm50868					 **The Commentary on the Book of the Kings** that the Chronicler used as a source is no longer available to us (see also *9:29*).\n\n
25:1	idm50876					 The **twenty-nine years** of **Amaziah**’s reign (796–767 BC) included a long co-regency with his son Uzziah from 792 BC.\n\n
25:2	idm50886					 **but not wholeheartedly:** See *2 Kgs 14:3-4* for further details.\n\n
25:3	idm50894					 **Amaziah . . . executed the officials** to avenge his father and carry out the justice prescribed in **the Law.**\n\n
25:5	idm50902					 The inclusion of **Benjamin** in this listing of military officers indicates that this tribe was part of the kingdom of **Judah** at that time.\n\n
25:6	idm50910					 Amaziah’s force of 300,000 was smaller than Asa’s (580,000) or Jehoshaphat’s (1,160,000) had been; this might explain Amaziah’s desire **to hire** additional troops **from Israel** (the northern kingdom).\n\n
25:7	idm50918					 The phrase **a man of God** was a way to refer to a prophet (as in *Deut 33:1*; *1 Sam 2:27*; *9:6-10*; *1 Kgs 13:1-31*). • The kingdom of **Israel** was politically foreign and spiritually apostate. Relying on Israel’s **troops** for military strength would bring spiritual compromise and God’s opposition.\n\n
25:11	idm50931					 The **Valley of Salt** was a perennial battlefield south of the Dead Sea; David had also fought with the Edomites there (*2 Sam 8:13*; see *Ps 60*). • Amaziah did not capture the port at Elath (*2 Chr 26:2*); his conquest was limited to northern Edom.\n\n
25:14	idm50941					 Conquerors sometimes worshiped the gods of a vanquished nation, wrongly believing that the gods of the defeated people had helped them to victory. **Amaziah** held this pagan mindset; he did not believe that the Lord is the only true God (see *Isa 40:18-28*; *42:8*; *Jer 10:1-16*).\n\n
25:20	idm50951					 Amaziah’s pride was manifested in his failure to seek God. While he seriously overestimated his military capability after defeating Edom, his decision to go to war against Jehoash was actually the result of trusting other gods and of ignoring God’s judgment that followed (cp. *18:9-34*; *2 Thes 2:11*).\n\n
25:21	idm50959					 **Beth-shemesh** protected the entrance to the Sorek Valley and Jerusalem’s access to the coast. Jehoash might have been seeking to cut off Jerusalem’s access to trade, or he might have been trying to increase his own access.\n\n
25:23	idm50966					 The **Ephraim Gate** was on the north side of the city, while **the Corner Gate** was on the western wall.\n\n
26:1	idm50974					 The Chronicler gave **Uzziah** (called Azariah in Kings) a double introduction (*26:1-2*, *3-5*), quoting two passages found in Kings (*2 Kgs 14:21-22*; *15:2-3*).\n\n
26:3	idm50985					 The **fifty-two years** of **Uzziah**’s reign (792–740 BC) included a long co-regency with his father, Amaziah (from 792 to 767 BC), and a co-regency with his son Jotham (from 750 to 740 BC).\n\n
26:6	idm50996					 These verses summarize Uzziah’s international achievements. His conquests were to the west, south, and southeast, but not to the north, where Jeroboam II’s kingdom was powerful (*2 Kgs 14:23-29*). Uzziah’s strategy, with God’s guidance (*2 Chr 26:7*), was to achieve control over the coastal highway and then build towns in the conquered territory.\n\n
26:9	idm51004					 Uzziah repaired damage done to Jerusalem’s walls by Jehoash in his campaign against Amaziah; Uzziah might also have repaired damage from the famous earthquake during his time (*Amos 1:1*; *Zech 14:5*). Towers and cisterns from excavations in Qumran, Gibeah, Beersheba, and other sites date to this period. • Uzziah was a patron of agriculture, a vital industry for an independent society.\n\n
26:11	idm51012					 Uzziah’s large and well-equipped **army** enabled him to expand and defend his territory. His name has been found on a fragmentary text of Tiglath-pileser III of Assyria, identifying **Uzziah** as head of a coalition.\n\n
26:16	idm51020					 Uzziah’s leprosy was a judgment on the covenant violation of **burning incense** within the Temple, an activity reserved exclusively for **priests** (*Exod 30:7-9*; *Num 16*).\n\n
26:21	idm51030					 The **leprosy** forced **King Uzziah** to spend the end of his life in quarantine in **a separate house** (literally *a free house*). The significance of this term is not known; it is often interpreted to mean that he was free from the duties of the monarchy. In Ugaritic texts, it seems to be a euphemism for a place of total confinement.\n\n
27:1	idm51040					 After a co-regency of eleven years with his father, Uzziah (750–740 BC), **Jotham** became king in his own right and **reigned** five more years (740–735 BC). This represents the **sixteen years** mentioned in the text. Jotham lived at least four more years, for we read that Hoshea came to power in the northern kingdom “in the twentieth year of Jotham son of Uzziah” (*2 Kgs 15:30*). But Jotham’s son, Ahaz, had already begun a co-regency with Jotham. After Jotham’s sixteen official years, Ahaz began to rule in his father’s stead (see *study note on 2 Kgs 16:1-2*). However, Ahaz presumably had his official accession ceremony following his father’s death in 732 BC, so the author of 2 Chronicles reckons Ahaz’s official regnal years starting in 731 BC (see *2 Chr 28:1*).\n\n
27:3	idm51056					 Jotham’s rebuilding endeavors were like those of his father; he continued the work of restoration begun by Uzziah. He also constructed **fortresses and towers** in the forests, providing a network of lookouts and highway defenses within the kingdom and on the frontier.\n\n
27:5	idm51063					 Uzziah had received tribute from **the Ammonites** (*26:8*), and Jotham continued to dominate their territory east of the Jordan. The end of these payments after **three years** might have been because of Jotham’s preoccupation with fighting Israel and Aram (*2 Kgs 15:37*).\n\n
28:1	idm51073					 After a co-regency with his father, Jotham, **Ahaz** became king in his own right and **reigned . . . sixteen years,** from 731 to 715 BC.\n\n
28:3	idm51082					 **even sacrificing his own sons in the fire:** Ahaz was imitating the abominable conduct of the Canaanites (see *Deut 12:31*; *18:9-10*; *Jer 7:31*; *19:5*; *32:35*).\n\n
28:9	idm51094					 **you have gone too far:** Although the Lord was using Israel as a means of punishment toward Judah, the covenant prohibited the enslavement and murder of fellow Israelites (*28:10*; *Lev 25:39-55*).\n\n
28:11	idm51103					 The Chronicler expresses a positive attitude toward the north with the term **relatives** (literally *brothers*). • **now the** Lord**’s fierce anger has been turned against you:** Later, during Ahaz’s reign, the kingdom of Israel would be destroyed and exiled (722 BC, *2 Kgs 17:5-23*).\n\n
28:16	idm51116					 **Ahaz . . . asked the king of Assyria for help:** See *2 Kgs 16:7-9* for more details.\n\n
28:17	idm51124					 The Edomites and **the Philistines** were natural enemies **of Judah**. The towns captured by these armies were all along the **Aijalon***,* Sorek, and Elah valleys in the buffer zone of **the foothills of Judah** or **the Negev**.\n\n
28:22	idm51136					 King Ahaz spurned the Lord by building an altar modeled after one in Damascus (*2 Kgs 16:10-16*) and by offering **sacrifices to the gods of Damascus**.\n\n
28:24	idm51144					 Judah reached its spiritual nadir—a condition similar to exile—under King Ahaz.\n\n
28:26	idm51150					 Samaria, the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel, fell to Assyria in 722 BC, during the twenty-first year of Ahaz’s reign in Judah (*2 Kgs 17:1-6*). The Chronicler, with his emphasis on the southern kingdom, does not even mention this event.\n\n
29:1	idm51158					 After a co-regency with his father, Ahaz, **Hezekiah** became king in his own right and **reigned** from 715 to 686 BC.\n\n
29:3	idm51167					 Hezekiah’s first act as king was to repair the doors of the Temple (*29:3*). The verb used (*yekhazzeqem,* “he made them strong”) is a deliberate pun on the name of King Hezekiah (*yekhizqiyyahu,* “Yah makes strong”). This action provided a setting for the king’s speech to **the priests and Levites** (*29:5-11*).\n\n
29:5	idm51178					 Hezekiah’s speech used vocabulary typical of exile to describe the failure of the nation. As in the days of the separation under Rehoboam (*12:1*; see *13:10*), the people had been **unfaithful** when they **abandoned the** Lord.\n\n
29:12	idm51189					 To begin the process of sanctifying the Temple, **these Levites** began with their own sanctification. First, **they all purified themselves***,* probably by bringing offerings (cp. *30:15*);** then they began to cleanse the Temple**. Two separate acts were required to restore the Temple: purification (the removal of pollution, *29:15-17*) and sanctification (the rededication of the Temple for holy worship, *29:20-36*).\n\n
29:12	idm51202					 **Kohath . . . Merari . . . Gershon** were the three sons of Levi; their descendants had become the three main clans of the tribe of Levites (see *Exod 6:16*).\n\n
29:21	idm51210					 The **bulls***, . . .* **rams***,* and **lambs** were for the **burnt offering***,* and the **male goats** were for the **sin offering** (see *Lev 1*; *4:1–5:13*).\n\n
29:31	idm51227					 The purification and rededication of the Temple was followed by individual offerings and sacrifices by the people. • The **thanksgiving offerings** were also called praise offerings, peace offerings, or offerings of well-being (see *Lev 3*).\n\n
29:34	idm51235					 The Chronicler shows surprise and delight at the people’s spontaneity and at the great number of devoted praise offerings consumed as part of the thanksgiving festivities. These things indicated that the Lord himself had prepared the people’s hearts for the event, far beyond what the **priests** and **Levites** had anticipated.\n\n
30:1	idm51243					 This account of Hezekiah’s celebration of **Passover** reflects the Chronicler’s concern with the unity of Israel, the spiritual preparedness of the people, and the success of following the formula for restoration given by Solomon at the dedication of the Temple (*7:14*).\n\n
30:2	idm51251					 **a month later than usual:** The law made provision for the delayed observance of the **Passover** if an individual inadvertently was ceremonially unclean or was away on a long journey (*Num 9:9-11*); Hezekiah’s Passover followed the spirit if not the letter of those provisions. The delayed Passover provided opportunity for national unity and spiritual renewal.\n\n
30:5	idm51260					 Hezekiah dispatched couriers **from Beersheba . . . to Dan***,* the traditional designation for the entire nation, including even the now-desolate territories of Israel’s northern tribes.\n\n
30:9	idm51268					 The northern kingdom had been conquered by the Assyrians (*2 Kgs 17:5-28*), and many of its people were taken into exile in Assyria. People from other conquered lands now lived there. Most of these foreigners, as well as those Israelites left by the Assyrians, regarded the conquest of Israel as proof that the Lord—the God of Israel—was impotent. They **laughed** at the thought of making a pilgrimage **to Jerusalem** to honor him.\n\n
30:11	idm51277					 **Some people . . . humbled themselves***,* fulfilling the first criterion in Solomon’s formula (*7:14*).\n\n
30:14	idm51286					 Several challenges faced Hezekiah before Passover could be observed. Although the Temple had been purified, the city was not pure. The first task of the assembled multitude was to remove all **pagan altars***,* which they disposed of in the **Kidron Valley***,* where they could be burned.\n\n
30:15	idm51296					 The priests were inadequately prepared for the great number of people who came. The problem might have involved the priests who came from outside the city and had not been a part of the earlier purification. However, the response of the people outstripped that of the professional clerics, to their great shame.\n\n
30:17	idm51302					 A large number of pilgrims who traveled great distances from foreign lands did not have an opportunity to receive the proper purification ceremonies and were unfit to participate in the ceremony. Hezekiah allowed the pilgrims to eat the Passover without participating in the sacrificial ritual and in an impure state, and he prayed that God would accept their worship. Hezekiah was following the formula for restoration (see *7:14*).\n\n
30:20	idm51309					 God’s response to Hezekiah’s prayer showed that he is more concerned with the attitude of the heart than with strict attention to ritual details. • **healed the people:** Cp. *7:14*.\n\n
30:25	idm51317					 In this joyful celebration, no one was regarded as a foreigner, and those who had been estranged were reunited.\n\n
30:26	idm51323					 No celebration like this had occurred **since the days of Solomon**. Hezekiah put into place the conditions for covenant faithfulness equal to those during the time of David and Solomon.\n\n
31:1	idm51330					 Following the purification and rededication of the Temple, the city of Jerusalem, and the people, Hezekiah initiated the third stage of his reform, purifying the entire land of pagan objects of worship, not only in Judah but also in the territories of the north.\n\n
31:3	idm51336					 Provisions for the Temple came from both the king and his subjects. Israel united in its support of the Temple, and the response was far greater than anticipated or required.\n\n
31:6	idm51342					 The **tithes** of the animals that **piled . . . up in great heaps** might refer to the proceeds from the sale of animals rather than the animals themselves. The law permitted **the people** to exchange the yield of the field for money (*Deut 14:24-26*) and to consume the meat at their homes (*Deut 12:15*).\n\n
31:10	idm51353					 The people’s great generosity is reminiscent of when the Tabernacle was first constructed (*Exod 36:3-5*).\n\n
31:14	idm51360					 A great number of Levites, most from provincial towns, were eligible for service. Small groups of them came to Jerusalem on a rotation system for short terms of office (see *1 Chr 24:1-19*). All Levites were entitled to portions of the offerings given at the Temple.\n\n
32:1	idm51367					 The Chronicler summarizes in twenty-three verses the lengthy account of the **siege** against Jerusalem (cp. *2 Kgs 18:17–19:37*; *Isa 36–38*). God’s response to the attack of **King Sennacherib of Assyria** was a blessing that resulted from Judah’s and Hezekiah’s faithfulness in seeking the Lord.\n\n
32:3	idm51377					 Sennacherib’s attack did not come as a surprise; Hezekiah provoked it by breaking a treaty (*2 Kgs 18:7*, *20*). Because water was critical to both attacker and defender in siege warfare, Hezekiah made sure that Sennacherib’s army would not have access to the city’s water supply. In one of the most famous engineering feats of ancient times, Hezekiah’s tunnel connected the fresh waters of the Gihon Spring to the pool of Siloam, making water accessible from within the city walls. This famous tunnel is almost one-third of a mile long (approximately 580 yards [530 meters]) and about six feet [2 meters] high. The famous Hezekiah inscription, discovered in the tunnel in 1880, describes how the excavators met to join the two ends. Although much of the tunnel consisted of natural underground aqueducts, it was a tremendous strategy for protecting the citizens of the city.\n\n
32:10	idm51385					 The Assyrian king’s threats clarified the critical issues for the people of Jerusalem. The real question was whether or not to trust in God. The enemy king suggested that Hezekiah could not be trusted (*32:11-12*) because he had offended the Lord by tearing down God’s shrines and altars. However, just the opposite was true. This reform was Hezekiah’s greatest act of faithfulness to the Lord. The question came down to whether God could be trusted against the power of Assyria (*32:11-15*).\n\n
32:21	idm51393					 The fate of **Sennacherib** is reported similarly to the account in Kings (see *2 Kgs 19:35-37*).\n\n
32:22	idm51401					 The Chronicler’s conclusion provides a fitting end to the story: The disaster for Assyria resulted in domestic peace for Judah, and both **the** Lord and **Hezekiah** received honor from other nations.\n\n
32:26	idm51410					 The humble repentance of both Hezekiah and the people pleased God, so **the** Lord**’s anger did not fall on them during Hezekiah’s lifetime**.\n\n
32:27	idm51419					 Hezekiah’s wealth marked him as a king like Solomon.\n\n
32:31	idm51425					 The details of the visit by the Babylonian envoys is recorded more fully in *2 Kgs 20:12-20*. The Chronicler provides a commentary on God’s purposes in that visit.\n\n
33:1	idm51432					 **Manasseh** ruled **fifty-five years** (697–642 BC), longer than any other king in Judah. The years of his reign included a co-regency with his father, Hezekiah, from 697 to 686 BC. Such a long reign was usually a sign of blessing, even though Manasseh **did what was evil in the** Lord**’s sight**. So the Chronicler tells of his humiliation, repentance, and restoration of worship in Judah.\n\n
33:7	idm51445					 The **carved idol** was an image of Asherah (see *2 Kgs 21:7*).\n\n
33:11	idm51453					 A nose ring caused not only pain but complete humiliation. Assyrian records portray such treatment of their prisoners.\n\n
33:12	idm51459					 The book of Kings does not mention Manasseh’s repentance, telling only of the promise of judgment resulting from his wicked deeds (see *2 Kgs 21:10-16*). Chronicles tells the good things he did after he repented, following his father Hezekiah’s example. However, Manasseh’s actions were unable to turn the hearts of the people back to the Lord or to avert God’s judgment on Judah (*2 Chr 33:17*).\n\n
33:12	idm51467					 Manasseh’s response followed the requirements of Solomon’s prayer at the dedication of the Temple (*7:14*).\n\n
33:13	idm51474					 Manasseh’s experience was a microcosm of what the nation would experience: exile and bondage brought on by apostasy, then repentance and returning to the Lord.\n\n
33:14	idm51480					 Manasseh might have been repairing damage done to the walls when he was taken captive. His religious reforms were similar to Hezekiah’s but incomplete; Josiah later removed the Temple altars that Manasseh built (*2 Kgs 23:12*).\n\n
33:18	idm51487					 **The Book of the Kings of Israel** is a record that no longer exists.\n\n
33:19	idm51494					 **The Record of the Seers:** This record no longer exists.\n\n
33:21	idm51501					 **Amon**’s short reign was from 642 to 640 BC.\n\n
33:24	idm51509					 The political forces that brought about **Amon’s** assassination are not indicated, but they might have been instigated by Egypt when Assyria’s declining power provided opportunity.\n\n
34:1	idm51516					 **Josiah**’s reign of **thirty-one years** was from 640 to 609 BC.\n\n
34:3	idm51525					 **Josiah began to seek the God of his ancestor David** when he was just sixteen. He initiated his own acts of reform when he reached age twenty.\n\n
34:6	idm51532					 By Josiah’s twelfth year as king (628 BC), the Assyrian Empire had largely disintegrated. During this time, the north of Israel was virtually deserted, making it possible for Josiah to extend his influence and control into **Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, even as far as Naphtali.**\n\n
34:12	idm51540					 That **musicians** supervised the construction shows how important it was for **Levites** to be in charge of this work. Other ancient texts note that music was a common element of construction projects.\n\n
34:14	idm51548					 The discovery of **the Book of the Law of the** Lord was one of the rewards for faithfulness. • The book **that was written by Moses** was probably Deuteronomy. It might have been neglected and lost during the apostasies of Manasseh or Amon.\n\n
34:24	idm51557					 **the curses written in the scroll:** See *Deut 27:14-26*; *28:15-68*. Curses in a covenant stipulate what will happen to those who are unfaithful to the covenant, as Israel and Judah were in their covenant with the Lord. These curses included exile.\n\n
34:27	idm51566					 King Josiah did not die in peace; he was killed by Pharaoh Neco II of Egypt (*35:20-25*). However, Josiah was **buried in peace***,* meaning that the city of Jerusalem was at peace and exile did not come during Josiah’s reign. His repentant spirit averted immediate disaster.\n\n
34:29	idm51575					 Renewal of the covenant was the most significant event in Josiah’s reform.\n\n
35:3	idm51581					 The **holy Ark** might have been removed from **the Temple** during the apostasy of Manasseh or Amon.\n\n
35:4	idm51589					 The assignments of the priests and Levites mirrored the **directions** of **David** and **Solomon** (*8:14-15*; *1 Chr 24–26*). The Passover animal was typically slaughtered by the offerer (*Deut 16:5-6*). However, because the offerers did not have time to purify themselves, Josiah continued the practice Hezekiah had begun of having the Levites slaughter the Passover animals (see *2 Chr 30:13-20*). In Josiah’s time, the large number of participants also might have caused logistical problems.\n\n
35:7	idm51602					 The Passover sacrifice required **lambs and young goats** (*Exod 12:21*). The **cattle** were an additional offering. The totals **Josiah provided** along with the contributions of others were nearly double the offerings in Hezekiah’s time (see *2 Chr 30:24*), yet less than the offerings at the dedication of the Temple (see *7:5*).\n\n
35:13	idm51614					 The Levites **brought** the food **out quickly***,* observing the element of haste required in the Passover (*Exod 12:11*).\n\n
35:18	idm51624					 This **Passover** included a greater number of participants than the one Hezekiah had observed. In this Passover, **the priests and Levites** took a prominent and proper role, as Josiah had specifically required (*35:15-16*; cp. *30:3*, *15*).\n\n
35:20	idm51635					 The narrative jumps from Josiah’s eighteenth year (622 BC) to the year of his death (609 BC). The decline of the Assyrian Empire brought Egypt and Babylon, two great powers that had long been subject to Assyria, into conflict with each other. **King Neco of Egypt***,* who had allied with Assyria to resist Babylonian expansion, asked Josiah to allow free passage of his army. Josiah’s interception might have been the result of a coalition with Babylon, or it might have been his own attempt to establish independence from Egypt. Josiah’s death was caused by his disobedience to a divine oracle delivered by a Gentile king.\n\n
35:25	idm51645					 **Jeremiah** held **Josiah** in high esteem (see *Jer 22:15-16*; cp. *Jer 22:10*). **The Book of Laments** was lost; it is not related to the Book of Lamentations.\n\n
36:1	idm51656					 **Jehoahaz***,* also known as Shallum (see *Jer 22:11*), was not Josiah’s oldest son (*1 Chr 3:15*), and the reason he was chosen as king is not explained. Pharaoh Neco immediately intervened and established Jehoahaz’s older brother **Eliakim** in his place and renamed him **Jehoiakim**.\n\n
36:2	idm51668					 **Jehoahaz**’s reign of **three months** was in 609 BC.\n\n
36:5	idm51677					 **Jehoiakim** reigned from 609 to 598 BC. • **He did what was evil:** Jeremiah characterized his reign as one of self-aggrandizement and injustice (*Jer 22:13-17*).\n\n
36:9	idm51687					 The Chronicler limits his record of Jehoiachin’s short reign to his exile and payment of tribute from the Temple instruments. The capture of Jehoiachin is described in the *Babylonian Chronicle:* “In the seventh year (of Nebuchadnezzar), the month of Kislev, the king of Akkad mustered his troops, marched to [the land west of the Jordan], and encamped against the city of Judah, and on the second day of the month of Adar he seized the city and captured the king.” Jehoiachin was thus taken captive on March 16, 597 BC. He was taken to Babylon about a month later. • Jehoiachin remained a captive in Babylon for thirty-seven years (see *2 Kgs 25:27*; *Jer 52:31*).\n\n
36:11	idm51697					 Although **Jeremiah** repeatedly urged **Zedekiah** to submit to the Babylonians rather than look for help from Egypt (*Jer 25:1-11*; *27:1-22*; *34:1-22*; *37:1–38:28*), Zedekiah **refused to humble himself** and **rebelled***,* violating his oath.\n\n
