1:1	idm31524					 **Elkanah** was a Levite (*1 Chr 6:22-27*). After the conquest of the Promised Land, the Levites were given towns in the territories of the other Israelite tribes, including **Ephraim** (*Josh 21:20*). • Elkanah’s hometown was **Ramah** (*1 Sam 2:11*). This location should not be confused with the Ramah in the tribal area of Benjamin (see *Josh 18:25*; *Judg 19:13*; *Matt 2:18*). • The **region of Zuph** was named after one of Elkanah’s ancestors, a Levite of the clan of Kohath (*1 Chr 6:35*). Saul first met Samuel in Zuph while searching for his father’s donkeys (*1 Sam 9:5*). • Elkanah’s lengthy genealogy suggests he was socially prominent.\n\n
1:2	idm31542					 Hardly an instance exists in Scripture where a man’s simultaneous marriage to **two wives** did not produce serious friction (*1:6-7*; *Gen 16*; *21*; *29*).\n\n
1:3	idm31553					 Elkanah made this trip **each year***;* the law required that people attend three annual festivals (*Exod 23:14-17*). • According to God’s law, Israelites were to **sacrifice** at God’s chosen sanctuary (*Deut 12:1-28*). From the days of Joshua (*Josh 18:1*) through Samuel’s era, God’s sanctuary—the Tabernacle—was at **Shiloh***,* a town in Ephraim some 8.5 miles north of Bethel en route to Shechem. King David eventually moved it to Jerusalem (*2 Sam 6*). • **the** Lord** of Heaven’s Armies:** Throughout the Hebrew Old Testament, God is often referred to as *Yahweh Tseba’oth* or *’Elohim Tseba’oth*. Traditionally, these titles have been translated “Lord of hosts” and “God of hosts.” The term “hosts” (Hebrew *tseba’oth,* traditionally “sabaoth”) usually means “armies.” It can refer to human armies, such as the armies of Israel (e.g., *1 Sam 17:45*), or foreign armies sent to fulfill the Lord’s purposes (e.g., *Isa 9:11-13*). However, most often it refers to God’s angelic armies sent from heaven to do his bidding and wage war on earth (e.g., *2 Kgs 6:17*). This designation anticipates God’s role as a mighty warrior in the episode involving the Ark of the Covenant and the Philistines (*1 Sam 4–6*).\n\n
1:4	idm31579					 **sacrifice . . . portions of the meat:** Certain sacrifices involved sharing part of the sacrificial animal in a communal meal (see *Lev 7:11-34*).\n\n
1:7	idm31587					 **the Tabernacle:** Also called “the Temple of the Lord” in *1:9*. These designations reflect that the Tabernacle, a portable structure, served as the central sanctuary at Shiloh.\n\n
1:9	idm31596					 **the Tabernacle:** Literally *the Temple of the* Lord. Solomon’s Temple had not yet been constructed, so the word *Temple* here means the Lord’s sanctuary.\n\n
1:11	idm31606					 Hannah’s **vow** was a promise to give the child back to the Lord as a Nazirite (see *Num 6:1-21*). Hannah might have hoped that her child would be another Samson (cp. *Judg 13*), a deliverer of God’s people.\n\n
1:13	idm31615					 Some people might have used the feast times at Shiloh as an occasion to get **drunk** rather than to worship. Eli mistakenly assumed Hannah was another drunken reveler (cp. *Acts 2:13-15*).\n\n
1:16	idm31623					 **wicked woman** (Hebrew *a daughter of Belial*): An expression used to describe a worthless person. Belial (“worthlessness”) is later used as a name for Satan (*2 Cor 6:15*). In Hebrew, a *son of* or *daughter of* a quality is a person who exemplifies that quality.\n\n
1:17	idm31634					 A blessing was more than mere wishful thinking. It was often God’s means of conferring a real benefit (see, e.g., *Gen 27:1-40*; *28:1-4*; *32:22-32*; *48:1–49:28*). Because this blessing from God’s high priest provided assurance that Hannah’s prayer would be answered, she was **no longer sad**.\n\n
1:22	idm31645					 **until the boy is weaned:** Hannah would have nursed Samuel two to four years.\n\n
1:23	idm31652					 Elkanah could have overridden Hannah’s **promise** (*Num 30:12-14*), but instead he affirmed and supported it.\n\n
2:1	idm31660					 Hannah’s Prayer of Praise celebrates Samuel’s dedication to the Lord’s service by rejoicing in God’s uniqueness (*2:1-2*), his ability to reverse fortunes (*2:3-9*), and his ability to strengthen his chosen king (*2:10*). Like Mary’s Song of Praise (*Luke 1:46-55*), Hannah’s prayer emphasizes God bringing down the rich and powerful and exalting the poor and the downtrodden (*1 Sam 2:7-8*; *Luke 1:52-53*). David’s prayer in *2 Sam 22* is another beautiful proclamation of God’s saving power as it relates to his chosen king (*1 Sam 2:10*). The rich, unrighteous rulers of the land (Eli, Saul, Herod) will be brought down, while the leaders who fulfill God’s purposes (Samuel, David, Jesus) will be exalted.\n\n
2:1	idm31674					 **made me strong:** Literally *has exalted my horn*; cp. *2:10*. The horn of a powerful animal, such as an ox or bull, was a symbol of strength that was held high in triumph after defeating an enemy (cp. *1 Kgs 22:11*).\n\n
2:2	idm31684					 **no one besides you:** David responded similarly after receiving God’s promises concerning his kingship (*2 Sam 7:22*). • **Rock** (cp. *2 Sam 22:2-3*, *32*): God provides stability and security for those who trust in him.\n\n
2:3	idm31695					 **proud and haughty:** Peninnah typified this attitude (see *1:6-7*). Hannah, by contrast, was humbly dependent on God.\n\n
2:4	idm31703					 Hannah celebrated God’s sovereign ability to radically reverse human circumstances.\n\n
2:5	idm31709					 **those who were starving are now full:** Cp. *1:7*, *18*. • The phrase **seven children** poetically means that the **childless woman** would be blessed with a house full of children (cp. *2:21*).\n\n
2:7	idm31721					 Cp. *Ps 113:7-9*.\n\n
2:8	idm31728					 **all the earth is the** Lord**’s:** God, the creator and ruler of all things, is able to change circumstances (*2:4-8*), protect the faithful (*2:9*), judge the wicked, and empower his anointed king (*2:10*).\n\n
2:10	idm31740					 The king was to fulfill the descriptions of *2:4-9* by using his God-given **power** to care for the oppressed, the hungry, and the barren (see *Ps 72:1-4*, *12-14*; *Prov 31:8-9*). • **he increases the strength:** See *study note on 1 Sam 2:1*. • **anointed one** (Hebrew *mashiakh*): This climax to Hannah’s prayer is prophetic both of Israel’s anointed kings and of God’s supreme Anointed King—the Messiah, Jesus Christ (see *12:3-5*; *24:6*, *10*; *Ps 132:17*; *Dan 9:25-26*).\n\n
2:12	idm31760					 **scoundrels** (Hebrew *sons of Belial*): See *study note on 1:16*. • **had no respect for** (literally *did not know*) **the** Lord**:** Although they were priests among God’s people, they did not acknowledge God or seek to abide by his will (cp. *Jer 2:8*).\n\n
2:13	idm31775					 The priests were supposed to receive their portion of the meat only after it had been boiled (see *Num 6:19*). Eli’s sons disregarded God’s instructions (*1 Sam 2:13-14*, *17*).\n\n
2:15	idm31784					 God’s law stipulated that the sacrificial **animal’s fat** was the Lord’s portion and had to be **burned on the altar** first (*Lev 3:3-17*).\n\n
2:18	idm31793					 The clause **Samuel . . . served the** Lord describes the ritual service of Levites and priests (see, e.g., *Num 3:4*; *8:19*, *24*; *Deut 18:7*). Like Eli’s sons, Samuel was a Levite (see *study note on 1 Sam 1:1*). But unlike Eli’s sons, he lived up to his calling. • **He wore a linen garment like that of a priest**, as did the priests who ministered in the sanctuary (see *study note on 22:18*).\n\n
2:20	idm31808					 **Eli would bless:** Blessing was one of the functions of a priest (*Num 6:23-27*; *Deut 10:8*; *1 Chr 23:13*). See *study note on 1 Sam 1:17-18*.\n\n
2:22	idm31819					 Eli’s weak attempts to change his sons’ behavior (cp. *2:29*) indicate that he had raised them without discipline (*3:13*).\n\n
2:22	idm31827					 **seducing . . . women:** Eli’s sons had probably been influenced by Canaanite religious practices, which included sex as part of the ritual. • **who assisted at the entrance:** See *Exod 38:8*.\n\n
2:25	idm31836					 **God** (or *the judges*; Hebrew *’elohim*): The Hebrew verb translated **mediate** is plural here, and when *’elohim* means “God,” it often appears with a singular verb. In addition, some ancient translations render *’elohim* as “judges” here. If that is the correct translation, then the judges would **mediate for the guilty party** in a common human court. However, many Hebrew scholars believe that *’elohim* should never be translated “judges.” If this is the case, in what sense could God *mediate for the guilty party?* Possibly Eli considered the court verdict to come directly from God. God might work through his revealed law or other circumstances to either acquit or convict an individual charged with wrongdoing. Or Eli might have been referring to the sacrificial system. • The sexual immorality (*2:22*) and gluttony (*2:12-17*) of Eli’s sons were **sins against the** Lord because they were corrupting Israel’s worship of him. No one can **intercede** for sinners who rebel so completely against God’s will (cp. *Matt 12:31*). • Eli’s sons did not **listen to their father** because the Lord had already begun to punish them by hardening their hearts (cp. *Exod 4:21*; *7:3*; *8:15-32*; *10:27*; *11:10*).\n\n
2:26	idm31863					 As children, both Samuel and Jesus possessed extraordinary qualities (*2:21*; see also *Luke 2:40*, *52*). Samuel was one of Christ’s forerunners.\n\n
2:27	idm31872					 **Man of God** is another name for a prophet (*9:6*; *1 Kgs 13:1*; *2 Kgs 1:9*).\n\n
2:29	idm31882					 By failing to stop his sons’ wickedness, Eli showed contempt for God’s **sacrifices and offerings**. Eli benefited from his sons’ activities, and God held Eli responsible for letting them continue.\n\n
2:30	idm31889					 **that your branch of the tribe of Levi would always be my priests:** See *Exod 29:9*; *Num 25:13*. God would **honor** another of Aaron’s descendants (see *study note on 2:35*) and **despise** Eli’s family, removing them from the priesthood (*2:31-35*).\n\n
2:32	idm31902					 **live out their days:** In the Old Testament, a short life often expresses God’s disfavor, while long life represents God’s blessing (cp. *Gen 15:15*; *1 Kgs 3:14*; *Ps 91:16*).\n\n
2:35	idm31912					 **a faithful priest:** Zadok and his descendants later replaced Eli’s family in the priesthood (*1 Kgs 2:26-27*, *35*).\n\n
3:1	idm31921					 **messages . . . were very rare . . . visions were quite uncommon:** God was not disclosing his will through prophets or priests, so the period was spiritually dark. However, that darkness was about to end when God communicated with Samuel (*3:2–4:1a*).\n\n
3:2	idm31929					 Eli was **almost blind***,* both physically and spiritually (*3:1*).\n\n
3:3	idm31938					 The priests were responsible for keeping **the lamp of God** burning through the night (*Exod 27:20-21*; *30:7-8*). • That Samuel **was sleeping . . . near the Ark** symbolizes his nearness to God’s presence and purpose, in contrast to Eli and his sons.\n\n
3:7	idm31948					 **Samuel did not yet know the** Lord**:** He lacked direct experience of the Lord. In contrast, Eli’s sons did not know the Lord (see *study note on 2:12*) in that they were morally and spiritually deficient.\n\n
3:8	idm31958					 **Eli realized:** Despite his many shortcomings, Eli was not completely without spiritual insight.\n\n
3:10	idm31965					 The doubling of the name calls attention to the seriousness of the moment (cp. *Gen 22:11*; *Exod 3:4*; *Matt 27:46*; *Luke 22:31*; *Acts 9:4*). • Samuel omits “Lord” (see *1 Sam 3:9*) from his response either out of reverence for the name or because of a lingering uncertainty about who was speaking.\n\n
3:11	idm31978					 The phrase **a shocking thing** conveys the magnitude and severity of God’s judgment. God’s actions would also be of national significance for Israel (cp. *2 Kgs 21:12*; *Jer 19:3*).\n\n
3:12	idm31987					 **my threats:** See *2:27-36*.\n\n
3:13	idm31995					 **his sons are blaspheming God:** They were expressing contempt for God through their actions. • **hasn’t disciplined them:** Eli rebuked his sons (*2:23-25*), but he did not restrain them.\n\n
3:14	idm32004					 Neither blood **sacrifices** nor **offerings** would be acceptable on behalf of Eli and his sons. The offerings of *Lev 4–5* were for sins committed inadvertently or unintentionally, whereas **the sins of Eli and his sons** were deliberate and rebellious.\n\n
3:15	idm32014					 Samuel **was afraid to tell Eli** of God’s plans for him and his family either because he respected Eli’s position or he feared for his own safety.\n\n
3:19	idm32021					 **proved to be reliable:** Samuel was an authentic prophet (*3:20*; see *Deut 18:21-22*).\n\n
3:20	idm32030					 The whole nation, **from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south***,* acknowledged that Samuel was God’s prophet. • **confirmed as a prophet:** The reliability of Samuel’s message (*3:19*) made it evident that God was speaking through him.\n\n
3:21	idm32040					 **The** Lord** continued to appear:** God reopened the lines of communication with Israel through Samuel (cp. *3:1*). • **Shiloh:** See *study note on 1:3*.\n\n
4:1	idm32052					 The crisis surrounding the Ark of the Covenant demonstrated Israel’s need for Samuel’s leadership and fulfilled prophecies about Eli and his sons (*3:11-14*).\n\n
4:1	idm32059					 **the Philistines:** See “*The Philistines*” Profile. • The exact location of **Ebenezer** is unknown. It was probably just east of Aphek (see also *1 Sam 7:12* and *corresponding study note*). • **Aphek** was west of Shiloh, well inland and well north of Philistine territory. By camping there, the Philistines might have been trying to seize more Israelite territory.\n\n
4:3	idm32071					 The Israelites were often **defeated** in war because of the sin of one individual or the entire nation (*Josh 7*). In this defeat, no one inquired whether sin was the cause; apparently no one had even asked the Lord whether they should engage the Philistines in the first place (cp. *1 Chr 14:13-16*). Instead, the Israelites treated the **Ark***,* the most sacred symbol of the Lord’s presence, as a charm to ward off misfortune. Carrying the Ark **into battle** was not necessarily wrong (cp. *Josh 6:2-21*), but neither would this act ensure God’s blessing and victory.\n\n
4:4	idm32084					 Lord** of Heaven’s Armies:** See *study note on 1:3*. • **enthroned between the cherubim:** A representation of God’s glorious presence hovered over the Ark in the Most Holy Place (God’s “throne room”). • The involvement of Eli’s sons, **Hophni and Phinehas***,* foreshadows the disaster that ensued (see *3:11-14*).\n\n
4:6	idm32097					 Like the Israelites, **the Philistines** regarded the **Ark** as a powerful talisman (see *4:2-3*) and believed that its presence in battle would mean sure **disaster** for them.\n\n
4:8	idm32107					 **the same gods who destroyed the Egyptians:** The Philistines, who worshiped many gods, knew of the Lord’s power. Yet they knew nothing of his nature as the one true God. • **destroyed . . . with plagues:** The Lord later showed his power against the Philistines similarly (see *5:6–6:6*).\n\n
4:10	idm32116					 **30,000** was more than seven times as many as  had**died** previously without the Ark (*4:2*). The Israelites learned the hard way that the Ark was not a talisman to ward off misfortune.\n\n
4:11	idm32125					 That the **Ark . . . was captured** was devastating to the Israelites (*4:12-22*). • The deaths of **Hophni and Phinehas** fulfilled the Lord’s word to Eli (*2:34*). Although they are the only casualties named, they were not the only Israelites who had sinned (see *7:3-6*).\n\n
4:12	idm32136					 **had torn his clothes and put dust on his head:** This description indicates **grief** and loss (e.g., *Josh 7:6*; *2 Sam 1:2*; *15:32*; *Job 2:12*).\n\n
4:15	idm32148					 **blind:** See *3:2* and *corresponding study note*.\n\n
4:18	idm32157					 **Eli fell backward:** Either he was startled or he had a heart attack when he heard the message. Eli’s fatal fall symbolizes his family’s fall from the priesthood and the end of the abomination that his sons began (*2:12-17*). • **Israel’s judge:** Priesthood and judgeship were not incompatible (cp. *Exod 18:13-26*; *Deut 17:8-13*). Samuel replaced Eli as Israel’s judge and provided leadership that Eli had failed to provide (see *1 Sam 7:12-17*). • The phrase **for forty years** incorporates Eli’s career into the conceptual and temporal framework of the book of Judges (cp. *Judg 3:11*; *5:31*; *8:28*; *13:1*).\n\n
4:20	idm32174					 The name **Ichabod** contains the Hebrew word *kabod* (**glory***;* see *Exod 24:15-17*). A similar word is used to describe Eli in *1 Sam 4:18* (Hebrew *kabed**,* “heavy”). The disappearance of the Ark parallels the demise of Eli’s house. Although the Israelites experienced a stunning loss of divine glory and protection (cp. *Ezek 8–10*; *Luke 19:41-44*; *21:20-24*), God’s glorious presence would subsequently return to his people (*1 Sam 6:1-21*; cp. *Ezek 43:1-8*).\n\n
5:1	idm32193					 **Ebenezer:** See *study note on 4:1b*. • **Ashdod***,* one of the five important Philistine cities (see *6:17*), was located along the same major trade highway (the Great Trunk Road) as Aphek.\n\n
5:2	idm32204					 **Dagon** was one of the Philistines’ gods (see *Judg 16:23-24*). The name could be related to the Hebrew *dag* (“fish”), an appropriate name for a god of seafaring people. More likely, it reflects the Hebrew *dagan* (“grain”), suggesting a fertility or agriculture god.\n\n
5:4	idm32214					 **his head and hands had broken off:** A symbol of God’s supremacy over the idol (*5:7*; see also *17:51*).\n\n
5:5	idm32223					 **step on its threshold:** While the Philistines might have believed that Dagon’s amputations resulted from their failure to honor the god properly, the true failure was in worshiping an idol rather than honoring the one true God (*Isa 44:6-20*).\n\n
5:6	idm32231					 **tumors:** The Hebrew term can mean simply “swellings.” A possible alternative translation is “hemorrhoids.” They were possibly the fatal *buboes* of bubonic plague, which attack the lower body, especially the rectal area. Rats are known carriers of the plague.\n\n
5:8	idm32239					 **rulers** (or *overlords*): Each of the five major Philistine cities had its own ruler (*6:16-18*). • **Move it:** Despite the obvious danger, the Philistines relished their captured trophy enough to relocate it rather than return it. • **Gath***,* one of the five major Philistine cities, was nearby.\n\n
5:9	idm32251					 God often used **great panic** to incapacitate and overwhelm Israel’s enemies (*14:15*, *20*; *Deut 7:23*; *Ezek 22:5*; *Amos 3:9*).\n\n
5:10	idm32263					 **Ekron***,* another of the five major Philistine cities (see *6:17*), was just five miles north of Gath.\n\n
6:2	idm32272					 **priests and diviners:** Divination was a part of Philistine religion (cp. *28:7*; *Deut 18:10-14*).\n\n
6:3	idm32281					 It is unlikely the Philistines were aware of Israelite worship regulations. A Philistine **guilt offering** would have been a payment to the deity in an attempt to avert his wrath (contrast the notion of atonement from *Lev 16*).\n\n
6:4	idm32289					 **rats:** See *study note on 5:6*.\n\n
6:6	idm32297					 The Philistines had thought they could overcome the Lord by fighting harder (*4:9*). They had defeated the Israelites, but they now realized that they could not defeat Israel’s God.\n\n
6:7	idm32304					 **shut their calves away:** If the **cows** went against their maternal nature and left their calves to take the Ark to Israel, it would prove that the plague was from Israel’s God (*6:9*).\n\n
6:9	idm32313					 **Beth-shemesh** was the closest Israelite town to Ekron (*5:10*).\n\n
6:13	idm32321					 **Harvesting wheat** was usually done in May or June.\n\n
6:14	idm32328					 This **burnt offering** could have been for forgiveness of sin (see *7:9-10*; *Lev 1:3-17*), but it was more likely a freewill expression of love or thanksgiving (see *Lev 22:18-22*).\n\n
6:15	idm32338					 Providentially, **the Ark** had arrived in **Beth-shemesh** (*6:13*), which was a Levite city (*Josh 21:13-16*). The **men of the tribe of Levi** who lived there could safely move the Ark (see *Num 4:15*).\n\n
6:17	idm32350					 **guilt offering:** See *study note on 6:3*. • **Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron:** These five major Philistine cities were located on or near the Great Trunk Road. This major ancient trade route connected Egypt with Mesopotamia via the coastal plain of Canaan. Each city was governed by a king-like ruler (*6:16*).\n\n
6:19	idm32360					 **seventy men: Beth-shemesh** was a small village. • **because they looked into the Ark:** Physical contact with the Ark was prohibited (*Num 4:15*; *2 Sam 6:6-8*), as was looking inside it (*Num 4:20*). Those who were killed lacked reverence for God’s holiness.\n\n
6:20	idm32371					 **Who is able to stand?** Even God’s people were not immune to his wrath when his holiness was violated. • **Where can we send the Ark?** When faced with God’s holiness, the Israelites echoed the distress of the pagan Philistines (*6:2*).\n\n
6:21	idm32380					 **Kiriath-jearim** was nearby, about ten miles northeast of Beth-shemesh.\n\n
7:1	idm32387					 The **men of Kiriath-jearim** who transported **the Ark** and **Eleazar** were probably Levites (see *6:15*; *Num 1:47-51*). • **in charge of it:** The same verb describes the Levites’ duty of guarding the Tabernacle (*Num 1:53*; *3:7*).\n\n
7:2	idm32401					 **Twenty years** covers the time until Samuel assembled the people at Mizpah (*7:5-6*). David later brought the Ark to Jerusalem (*2 Sam 6:1-19*).\n\n
7:3	idm32410					 The change in the people’s standing with God, not the presence of the Ark (see *4:3-11*), led Israel to victory against the Philistines.\n\n
7:3	idm32417					 People cannot expect God’s blessing unless they **get rid of** what is contrary to his will (see *Gen 35:2*; *Josh 24:14*). • **Ashtoreth** was the Canaanite goddess of fertility associated with Baal (*1 Sam 7:4*). Worship of Canaanite deities was an ongoing problem throughout Israel’s history. The people started worshiping idols during the twenty-year period mentioned in *7:2*, or perhaps they had done so ever since the days of the judges (*8:8*; *Judg 6:25*; cp. *Amos 5:25-26*). Israel’s devastating defeat by the Philistines was due not only to the sins of Eli’s two sons but to several generations of unfaithfulness to God.\n\n
7:5	idm32432					 **Mizpah** was an administrative center and rallying point for the nation (see *7:16*; *10:17*; *Judg 20:1*). • **I will pray . . . for you:** Eli’s question in *1 Sam 2:25* is answered here; Samuel was the intercessor Israel needed.\n\n
7:6	idm32444					 **drew water . . . poured it out:** This type of ceremony is not mentioned elsewhere in the Old Testament. • At times Israelites **went without food** to express grief or to seek the Lord’s favor (*2 Sam 1:12*; *12:22-23*; *1 Kgs 21:27*; *Ezra 8:21-23*; *Neh 9:1*; *Esth 4:3*, *16*; *Joel 2:12*; cp. *Luke 2:37*; *Acts 13:2-3*; *14:23*). • To have **Samuel** as **Israel’s judge** was refreshing compared to Eli’s failed leadership (see *1 Sam 4:18* and *corresponding study note*) and the leadership of some other judges (e.g., Gideon, *Judg 8:22-27*; Jephthah, *Judg 11:30–12:7*; and Samson, *Judg 13:1–16:21*).\n\n
7:9	idm32470					 The **whole burnt offering** was probably for forgiveness of sin (see *Lev 1:1-4*). • **The** Lord** answered** with a forceful thunderclap (*1 Sam 7:10*).\n\n
7:10	idm32482					 **voice of thunder:** See *2:10*. God often used similar tactics to throw Israel’s enemies into **confusion** and defeat them (e.g., *Exod 14:24*; *23:27*; *Josh 10:10*; *Judg 4:15*).\n\n
7:12	idm32495					 **Ebenezer:** The location of this **stone** memorial is unknown. The Philistines had defeated Israel and captured the Ark at a place with the same name (*4:1*; *5:1*). Samuel erected this memorial to commemorate God’s help in turning the tide against the Philistine attacks.\n\n
7:13	idm32505					 The Philistines were quiet **for some time**—until Saul became king (see *13:5*). • God’s **powerful hand***,* not Samuel’s giftedness, was the key factor in Israel’s deliverance from the Philistines.\n\n
7:14	idm32515					 The **Amorites** had inhabited Canaan and the region east of the Jordan before Israel’s conquest of the Promised Land (see *Gen 15:16*; *Deut 3:8*; *Josh 2:10*). Some Amorites remained in the area after the conquest (see *2 Sam 21:2*).\n\n
7:15	idm32526					 **judge for the rest of his life:** Once Saul became king (ch *10*), Samuel’s role was more judicial than military.\n\n
7:16	idm32534					 **Bethel** and **Mizpah** were places of national assembly in the judges era (*Judg 20:1*, *18*, *26*; *21:1-2*). Bethel’s significance went back to the days of Abraham (*Gen 12:8*; *13:3-4*; *28:10-22*; *35:1-15*). • **Gilgal***,* located near Jericho, had been a sacred place since Joshua’s day (*Josh 4:19-24*; *5:2-10*). From this circuit, Samuel influenced “all the people of Israel” (*1 Sam 10:17*).\n\n
7:17	idm32555					 **Ramah** was Samuel’s hometown (see *1:1*).\n\n
8:1	idm32563					 During Israel’s transition to a monarchy, neither God (*8:7-9*) nor Samuel (*12:1-25*) was pleased by the people’s demand for a king. Saul, the first king (chs *9–11*), failed in his role (chs *13–31*) and fulfilled Samuel’s warnings (see *8:10-18*; cp. *16:1-13*).\n\n
8:2	idm32575					  Samuel’s two **oldest sons** functioned as judges **in Beersheba***,* fifty miles south of their father’s home.\n\n
8:3	idm32584					 **they were not like their father:** They were more like Eli’s two sons (*2:12-17*). Their corruption was a primary reason the era of the judges ended.\n\n
8:5	idm32592					 **you are now old, and your sons are not like you:** Judges tended to be local leaders; kings, as national leaders, were more capable of uniting a whole nation in times of crisis (*8:20*). However, a spiritual problem underlay the request for a king (*8:7-8*). • **Other nations,** such as Egypt and Sumer, had monarchies for almost 2,000 years before Samuel’s time.\n\n
8:6	idm32602					 **Samuel was displeased:** He probably felt personally rejected (*8:7*).\n\n
8:7	idm32610					 **Do everything they say:** God rarely instructed a prophet to heed the voice of the errant populace. The will of the people and the will of God would converge in King David (see *2 Sam 7:8-17*). • **they are rejecting me:** Their rejection of judgeship was a deeper rejection of God’s rule and sovereignty (see also *1 Sam 12:1-17*).\n\n
8:8	idm32620					 **followed other gods:** The people’s request for a king was tantamount to idolatry. Israel’s monarchy was a divine concession rather than a divine gift. Kingship or any other human institution becomes idolatrous when it replaces trust in God.\n\n
8:10	idm32627					 These verses list the disadvantages of kingship. Each sentence begins with something the king would take. A king would be a confiscator, not just a protector.\n\n
8:11	idm32633					 While the people wanted a king to *judge* them, Samuel warned that the king would **reign over** them. They wanted a leader but received a ruler.\n\n
8:12	idm32641					 The king would take people as well as possessions.\n\n
8:15	idm32647					 A **tenth** of the harvest was already required as a sacred donation to support God’s Temple and servants (*Deut 12:6*, *17-18*; *14:22-29*; *26:12-15*). The king would demand an additional tenth, a burdensome amount given the uncertainties of agriculture.\n\n
8:17	idm32658					 **you will be his slaves:** By demanding a king, the people whose ancestors had once been slaves in Egypt were risking a new enslavement (cp. *1 Kgs 12:1-20*).\n\n
8:18	idm32666					 The people would **beg for relief** as their ancestors had done in Egypt under another punishing and exacting ruler (see *Exod 3:7*).\n\n
8:20	idm32674					 God had set Israel apart from the nations (*Lev 20:26*; *Num 23:9*). By insisting on a king and desiring to **be like the nations***,* they were rejecting God’s plan (see *1 Sam 8:5-7*; cp. *Deut 17:14*). • **judge us and lead us into battle:** Kings performed three basic functions: (1) waging offensive and defensive war, (2) administering law, and (3) ensuring economic well-being.\n\n
8:21	idm32687					 **repeated to the** Lord**:** The role of a prophet included bringing the people’s case before God (cp. *Num 27:5*).\n\n
8:22	idm32697					 **give them a king:** See *study note on 8:7*; cp. *Rom 1:24-26*.\n\n
9:1	idm32706					 Saul’s rise to power involved a threefold sequence: (1) his secret anointing by Samuel (*9:1–10:16*), (2) his selection by lot (*10:17-27*), and (3) his victory over the Ammonites (*11:1-15*). See also *study note on 13:1–16:13*.\n\n
9:1	idm32716					 **influential man named Kish:** Saul came from a wealthy family.\n\n
9:2	idm32723					 Saul’s mere appearance—**most handsome . . . taller than anyone else**—inspired loyalty among the people (see *10:23*; cp. *16:12*; *2 Sam 14:25-26*).\n\n
9:5	idm32733					 **Zuph***,* which was probably located in Ephraim, was Samuel’s home region (*1:1*). God’s providence led Saul there.\n\n
9:6	idm32742					 The phrase **man of God** was used to describe a prophet (*2:27*; also *Deut 33:1*; *Josh 14:6*; *1 Kgs 13:1-32*).\n\n
9:7	idm32753					 **anything to offer him:** Evidently, it was customary to take a gift when one sought the help of a prophet (cp. *1 Kgs 14:2-3*; *2 Kgs 5:5*, *15*; *8:8*). Some false prophets demanded gifts in return for their services (*Mic 3:11*). Saul’s concern might reflect the spiritual ignorance of thinking that advice from a prophet of God could be purchased (*Acts 8:20*).\n\n
9:12	idm32766					 Leaders of a community would normally convene for business at the **town gates** (cp. *Ruth 4:1-2*). • **take part in a public sacrifice:** Samuel is one of very few individuals in whom prophetic and priestly ministries unite (also Moses, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Jesus). • **place of worship** (literally *high place*): An open-air altar or platform on a hill near the city gate. High places easily became sites for pagan idolatry (see *Num 33:52*; *1 Kgs 15:14*; *22:43*; *2 Kgs 12:3*; *14:4*; *15:4*, *35*).\n\n
9:13	idm32784					 **to eat:** Part of a sacrifice made during worship was burned on the altar, while the remainder was eaten in a ceremonial feast by the **guests** (see also *1:4*). • **to bless the food:** As a Levite, Samuel’s priestly role included offering blessings (see *Deut 10:8*; *21:5*).\n\n
9:16	idm32796					 God’s directive to **anoint him** (by pouring olive oil on the head) marked Saul’s elevation in status and consecration for a special purpose (see *Exod 30:22-33*; *Lev 8:12*; *1 Kgs 19:16*; *Isa 45:1*). • **He will rescue them:** As they had requested (*1 Sam 8:20*; cp. *Judg 13:5*). David eventually subdued **the Philistines** (*2 Sam 5:17-25*; *8:1*; *21:15*, *18-22*). • **for I have . . . heard their cry** (cp. *Exod 3:7-9*): The Philistines were again threatening to conquer Israel and demand homage from them as vassals.\n\n
9:21	idm32817					 **the smallest tribe:** Saul tried to downplay Benjamin’s prominence, but they were powerful warriors (*Judg 20:14-31*; cp. *study note on 1 Sam 10:17*). What better tribe to lead in battle? • **least important of all the families:** Cp. *9:1*.\n\n
9:25	idm32828					 A typical house had a flat **roof** that was used for a variety of purposes, such as sleeping in warm weather (see *Deut 22:8*; *2 Kgs 4:10*).\n\n
10:1	idm32837					 Samuel later repeated this process by anointing David with **olive oil** (*16:13*). • The people of Israel did not belong to the king but to the Lord. The king was to act as manager rather than owner (cp. *8:10-18*).\n\n
10:2	idm32846					 These three “signs” were to convince a reluctant Saul (*9:21*) that he had in fact been chosen to be king.\n\n
10:2	idm32853					 **Rachel’s tomb at Zelzah:** See *Gen 35:16-20*; the precise location is unknown.\n\n
10:3	idm32861					 **oak of Tabor:** This location, somewhere in Benjamin, is not to be confused with the village of the same name in Zebulun (*1 Chr 6:77*). • **Bethel:** See *study note on 1 Sam 7:16*.\n\n
10:5	idm32871					 **Gibeah of God,** Saul’s hometown (*10:26*), had been a lawless city (*Judg 19–21*). Nowhere else is it described as being “of God.” This description might point to God’s ownership of the town despite the occupation of the **Philistines**. • **band:** Prophets often lived in groups (e.g., *2 Kgs 2:3*). • **harp . . . lyre:** Ancient prophets sometimes used musical instruments to stimulate and accompany **prophesying** (e.g., *2 Kgs 3:15*).\n\n
10:6	idm32886					 **prophesy:** Cp. *2 Sam 23:2*; *Acts 2:29-31*. • **different person:** Saul would become a spiritual and charismatic national leader (cp. *1 Sam 16:14*).\n\n
10:7	idm32897					 **for God is with you:** God’s presence empowered Saul to carry out his responsibilities.\n\n
10:8	idm32904					 **Gilgal:** See *study note on 7:16*. • **wait for seven days:** Saul apparently fulfilled this instruction in *11:14-15* (cp. *13:8*).\n\n
10:9	idm32915					 **a new heart:** God gave Saul courage and strength, helping him overcome his hesitancy and enabling him to be king (*10:6*).\n\n
10:10	idm32923					 **the Spirit of God came powerfully upon Saul:** See “*The Spirit’s Presence*” Theme Note; see also *11:6*; *Judg 14:6*, *19*; *15:14*; cp. *Acts 2:17-18*, *39*). • When **Saul . . . began to prophesy***,* it was a clear sign that he had been chosen to lead Israel (see also *1 Sam 19:18-23*).\n\n
10:11	idm32940					 **Those who knew Saul** might have known him to be nonreligious and thus an unlikely candidate for prophet. Their surprise might indicate disappointment at receiving a prophet instead of a king (cp. *John 6:14-15*).\n\n
10:12	idm32948					 **“Can anyone become a prophet, no matter who his father is?”** Unlike priests and kings, prophets never inherited their office. Possibly the people were asking why Saul, whose well-to-do father was well known, would associate himself with a group of people who had no pedigree.\n\n
10:16	idm32955					 Perhaps **Saul didn’t tell his uncle** because he had lingering uncertainty about what had transpired.\n\n
10:17	idm32962					 An earlier generation had gathered at **Mizpah** to decimate the tribe of Benjamin (*Judg 20:1-4*), making the city an ironic place to inaugurate a man of Benjamin as king.\n\n
10:18	idm32970					 **rescued you . . . from all of the nations:** Israel did not need a human king to rescue them; they needed God, but they had rejected him (*10:19*).\n\n
10:19	idm32978					 **rejected your God:** See also *8:7*. Israel was rejecting God’s ability to protect and save them. • **Clans** are subdivisions of **tribes**.\n\n
10:20	idm32988					 **chosen by lot:** Cp. *Lev 16:8*; *Josh 18:6*; *1 Chr 26:12-16*; *Acts 1:26*.\n\n
10:25	idm32999					 **rights and duties of a king:** See *Deut 17:14-20*. • **He wrote them:** Cp. *Exod 24:4*; *Josh 24:26*. • Samuel placed the document **before the** Lord—presumably in the Tabernacle. This position showed that God would honor those who lived by the covenant and punish those who violated it.\n\n
10:26	idm33012					 Saul proved his capacity for leadership by tolerating opposition and rescuing the town of Jabesh-gilead.\n\n
10:26	idm33018					 **whose hearts God had touched:** God gave people confidence in Saul’s ability to lead (cp. *10:9*).\n\n
10:27	idm33026					 These men were **scoundrels** (cp. *2:12*) because they **scorned** God’s chosen king. • **Gifts** were given to show homage (*Gen 32:13*, *18*, *20*), political friendship (*2 Kgs 20:12*), or submission (*Judg 3:15*, *17*). • **ignored them:** Saul’s self-restraint while being insulted was a sign of maturity. In contrast, *Proverbs 16:14* speaks of a king’s potentially explosive rage when somebody crosses him. See also *1 Sam 11:12-13*. • **[Nahash . . . Jabesh-gilead]:** See NLT note. Whether this paragraph was part of the original text is uncertain, but it provides historical context for *11:1-15* (e.g., *11:2*).\n\n
11:1	idm33048					 Saul’s kingship was confirmed through a military victory, the very reason the people wanted a king (*8:20*).\n\n
11:1	idm33055					 **Ammon** (see *Gen 19:38*), located on the east side of the Jordan, represented a threat to Israel similar to the Philistines to the southwest (see also *Judg 10:6–11:33*). • **Make a treaty with us:** Cp. *Josh 9*; *2 Sam 10:19*.\n\n
11:2	idm33067					 **gouge out the right eye:** Mutilation of captured soldiers was a common practice in the ancient Near East. These disfigured soldiers would have lost all depth perception, seriously curtailing their potential for fighting in a revolt.\n\n
11:3	idm33074					 Nahash agreed to grant a reprieve of **seven days,** reflecting his arrogant confidence of victory and his desire to humiliate Israel as much as possible.\n\n
11:7	idm33081					 Not to participate would indicate rejection of the leadership of both **Saul** as king and **Samuel** as prophet.\n\n
11:8	idm33089					 **Bezek** was about fourteen miles west of Jabesh-gilead. • The narrator’s use of the terms **Israel** and **Judah** anticipates the later division of the kingdom (*1 Kgs 12*).\n\n
11:13	idm33099					 **No one will be executed:** This was a time for rejoicing, not revenge.\n\n
11:14	idm33106					 **renew the kingdom:** “Renew” indicates that someone or something had deteriorated or had been damaged (cp. *Ps 51:10*). Whatever effect the scoundrels (*1 Sam 10:27*; *11:12*) might have had in undermining the people’s confidence was now rectified by Saul’s victory over the Ammonites.\n\n
11:15	idm33116					 The **solemn ceremony before the** Lord acknowledged Saul’s sovereignty as king while affirming that the Lord was Israel’s true King. • **Peace offerings** were common on historic occasions that inaugurated important institutions (see *Exod 24:5*; *Lev 9:4*, *18*, *22*; *1 Kgs 8:63-64*).\n\n
12:1	idm33130					 The reaffirmation of Saul’s kingship at Gilgal (*11:12-15*) was the final step in his installation as king. The event was a fitting occasion for Samuel’s farewell address as leader of Israel.\n\n
12:3	idm33137					 God’s **anointed one** was Saul (see *9:16*). • **Whose ox or donkey:** Cp. *Num 16:15*. • **have I stolen?** In contrast to the behavior of kings (*1 Sam 8:11-16*). • **Have I ever taken a bribe and perverted justice?** No, but Samuel’s sons did (*8:3*).\n\n
12:5	idm33151					 **my hands are clean:** Samuel’s life and leadership before Israel had been above reproach (cp. *1 Cor 9:1-14*; *2 Cor 7:2*; *11:7-9*; *1 Thes 2:1-12*). Saul, David, and Solomon—kings rather than prophetic judges—would not be able to make this claim.\n\n
12:6	idm33162					 In *12:1-5*, Samuel put himself on trial and was found innocent. In *12:6-25*, he put the nation on trial and found it guilty.\n\n
12:6	idm33170					 **Moses and Aaron** were not self-made leaders but were **appointed** by God as leaders.\n\n
12:9	idm33178					 **handed them over:** See *Judg 3:8*; *4:1-3*. • **the king of Moab:** See *Judg 3:12*. Not all of Israel’s enemies in the era of the judges are listed (e.g., the Ammonites and Midianites). This list is representative to emphasize the highs and lows of that era.\n\n
12:10	idm33189					 **Then they cried to the** Lord**:** Sometimes only suffering turns people’s hearts toward God. During the period of the judges, Israel repeatedly went through cycles of sin, oppression, repentance, and rescue. • **Baal and Ashtoreth:** When people turn **away from** God, they inevitably turn to idols (see *7:3*; *Judg 2:13*; *10:6*). • An attitude such as **if you will rescue us** turns **worship** into a debased bargain, in which God must perform some action to a person’s liking. God deserves obedience and *worship* because he is God, not because of favors he can perform.\n\n
12:11	idm33206					 As in *12:9*, this list of leaders is representative. • **Bedan:** Greek and Syriac versions read *Barak* (see *Judg 4:6-24*; *5:1*, *12*, *15*). The identity of this judge remains uncertain.\n\n
12:12	idm33219					 **you were afraid of Nahash:** Israel’s trouble with Nahash apparently preceded *11:1-11* (cp. *8:5*, *20*; *10:27*).\n\n
12:13	idm33230					 Even though the Israelites’ **request** amounted to a rejection of God as king, **the** Lord** . . . granted** it (see *study notes on 8:7* and *8:8*).\n\n
12:14	idm33242					 To show that even under a monarchy Israel must still keep its covenant with the Lord—who was always to be their true king—Samuel echoed language from the Sinai covenant (e.g., *Exod 19:5-6*; *Lev 26*; *Deut 30:11-20*).\n\n
12:14	idm33251					 **Worship** is meaningless if it does not result in obedience.\n\n
12:17	idm33258					 The **wheat harvest** occurred in late spring or early summer, when little or no rain fell in Israel. **Thunder and rain** would thus demonstrate God’s power as a sign of the people’s wickedness in asking for a king.\n\n
12:18	idm33266					 **terrified:** Cp. *Exod 19:16*.\n\n
12:19	idm33274					 The people asked Samuel to intercede for them (see also *7:8*) rather than praying themselves probably because they were out of fellowship with God (note the use of **your God** rather than “our God”). • **added to our sins:** The sins included idol worship (*12:21*; see *study note on 8:8*).\n\n
12:21	idm33285					 **worthless . . . totally useless:** Israel was slow to learn this lesson (e.g., *Isa 40:18-26*; *44:9-20*).\n\n
12:22	idm33294					 **because that would dishonor his great name:** God will never contradict his own character and detract from his glory (see also *Isa 37:35*; *43:25*; *48:9-11*). Therefore, he always keeps his covenant promises, even if his people do not. • **his very own people:** Israel is God’s treasured possession (see *Exod 19:5*; *Deut 9:25-29*). He will never abandon them (see *Rom 11:1-5*, *25-32*).\n\n
12:23	idm33309					 **I will continue to teach you:** Samuel was both intercessor and educator. • Although this address marked the end of Samuel’s political leadership, he continued his spiritual ministry for some time (e.g., *19:24*).\n\n
12:25	idm33317					 **swept away:** David later used this same Hebrew verb for Saul’s death (*26:10*, “die . . . in battle”) and for his own possible death at Saul’s hands (*27:1*, “get me”). The warning would remain in force throughout Israel’s history as a monarchy.\n\n
13:1	idm33326					 Saul’s fall from power involved a threefold sequence, as had his rise to power (see *study note on 9:1–11:15*): (1) He offered the sacrifices himself and did not wait for Samuel (*13:1-14*); (2) he made a rash oath that put Jonathan’s life in danger (*14:1-46*); and (3) he failed to obey God by eliminating the Amalekites and their belongings (*15:1-35*).\n\n
13:1	idm33336					 For the kings of Israel and Judah, Scripture normally records the age of ascension and the length of reign (e.g., *2 Sam 5:4-5*; *1 Kgs 14:21*). • **thirty years old:** The number represents a plausible age for Saul’s ascension. The Hebrew text and most Greek manuscripts omit the number , making it difficult to know the original wording. • **reigned for forty-two years:** See NLT textual note. Most scholars agree that something has fallen out of the original manuscript, most likely due to a copyist’s error. The majority of English translations have *forty-two* based on the approximate number in *Acts 13:21*.\n\n
13:2	idm33348					 Earlier, **Saul** had employed 330,000 troops to fight against a much less formidable foe (*11:8*). The selection here of **3,000 special troops** probably does not reflect overconfidence (cp. *Josh 7:3-4*). Rather, Saul likely recognized the need for a smaller, highly trained, elite militia to deal with the troublesome Philistines (see *1 Sam 14:52*). • **Micmash** was located in Benjamin about two miles northwest of Saul’s home in Gibeah.\n\n
13:3	idm33360					 **Geba** was located between Jonathan’s forces at Gibeah and Saul’s forces at Micmash. A deep gorge separated Geba and Micmash (see *13:23*; *14:5*). • **The ram’s horn** (Hebrew *shofar*) was used to raise a signal—e.g., to muster an army (*Judg 3:27*). For other uses, see *Lev 25:9*; *2 Sam 6:15*; *15:10*; *18:16*; *20:1*; *Hos 5:8*; *Joel 2:15*. • Non-Israelites often used the term **Hebrews** disdainfully (see *1 Sam 14:11*; *29:3*; see also *Gen 39:14*; *43:32*). Saul might have used it to strike a nerve and arouse the people’s pride in their identity.\n\n
13:4	idm33384					 **Saul had destroyed:** The commander in chief often got credit for what his soldiers accomplished. • Saul’s kingship had been reaffirmed at **Gilgal** (*11:15*). Now the Lord would reject his kingship there because of his disobedience (*13:7-14*).\n\n
13:5	idm33394					 The Israelites were massively outnumbered, hence their fearful responses. • The Philistine army’s **3,000 chariots** and **6,000 charioteers** indicate Israel’s underdog status. Nowhere in 1 Samuel is Israel said to have had any chariots (see *study note on 13:19-22*).\n\n
13:7	idm33403					 The **land of Gad and Gilead** ran the length of Transjordan (the region just east of the Jordan River).\n\n
13:8	idm33410					 **seven days . . . as Samuel had instructed:** This instruction most likely was not the instruction in *10:8* but an unrecorded instruction on a separate occasion (see *study note on 10:8*).\n\n
13:9	idm33419					 **the burnt offering and the peace offerings:** These general-purpose offerings (see *Exod 24:5*; *32:6*; *Num 10:10*; *15:8*; *Deut 27:6-7*) were always offered on a solemn occasion filled with either danger or joy. Typically, only priests were to offer these sacrifices (but see *study note on 1 Sam 13:13*).\n\n
13:10	idm33432					 **meet and welcome:** Saul seemed unaware he had done anything wrong.\n\n
13:11	idm33439					 **What is this you have done?** Samuel’s question was a rebuke, not a request for information (cp. *Gen 3:13*).\n\n
13:12	idm33447					 **asked for the** Lord**’s help:** The purpose of the **burnt offering** was to entreat God to grant victory in battle. Samuel himself had offered a similar sacrifice, which did lead to victory in battle (see *7:7-11*). But Samuel, unlike Saul, served in a priestly role.\n\n
13:13	idm33458					 **the command the** Lord** . . . gave you:** Other kings offered sacrifices without censure (David, *2 Sam 6:13*, *17-18*; Solomon, *1 Kgs 3:15*; *8:64*; Ahaz, *2 Kgs 16:12-13*), as did judges (Gideon, *Judg 6:26*), illustrating that on occasion non-priests could conduct sacrifices in a way that pleased the Lord. However, Samuel, God’s prophet, had given Saul the order to wait (see *study note on 1 Sam 13:8*).\n\n
13:14	idm33474					 **a man after his own heart:** This prophecy pertains to David (see also *Acts 13:22*) rather than to Saul’s son Jonathan. The rejection of Saul was also the rejection of his family dynasty.\n\n
13:15	idm33482					 **only 600 were left:** Most of the 3,000 troops (*13:2*) had abandoned Saul (*13:6-7*).\n\n
13:17	idm33491					 Armies would send out **raiding parties** to plunder and sow panic among the enemy. These raiders embarked north (**Ophrah**), west (**Beth-horon**), and east (**Zeboim**), but not south, where Israelite strength was consolidated and where the terrain did not allow easy movement of forces (see *study note on 13:23*).\n\n
13:19	idm33502					 **no blacksmiths:** The Philistines kept the Israelites unarmed by gaining a monopoly on the iron necessary to make weapons. Iron technology had not existed long in Canaan; it might have developed in the Aegean area, and metalworking skills were possibly introduced into Canaan through seafaring peoples, including the Philistines.\n\n
13:23	idm33509					 **The pass at Micmash** was a strategic passage through the canyon that separated Micmash from Geba, Gibeah, and other towns to the south.\n\n
14:1	idm33516					 Saul’s behavior in this chapter further justifies his dismissal as king (*13:8-14*; see also ch *15*). Saul was alienated from both Samuel and his heroic son Jonathan. *Chapter 14* anticipates the significant role that Jonathan played in the transition from Saul’s kingship to David’s.\n\n
14:1	idm33525					 Jonathan again fought in his father’s battles (see also *13:2-4*; ch *31*).\n\n
14:1	idm33533					 **armor bearer:** See *study note on 16:21*. • **Jonathan did not tell his father** because he knew that Saul would not grant permission for the dangerous plan. But he also knew that Saul wanted no one—not even his own son—to upstage him.\n\n
14:2	idm33542					 **camped:** Saul’s inactivity contrasts with Jonathan’s initiative (see also *22:6*).\n\n
14:3	idm33550					 **Ahijah the priest** was an adviser who could give Saul divine guidance through **the ephod** (*14:18-19*; see also *2:18* and *corresponding study note*; *23:9-10*). • **son of Eli:** Saul, the rejected king (*13:13-14*), kept in his company a priest from the rejected priesthood (*2:27-36*). • **Ichabod:** See *4:21*.\n\n
14:4	idm33567					 The Philistines had already secured this area (*13:23*), so Jonathan and his armor bearer had to move carefully.\n\n
14:6	idm33574					 **pagans** (literally *uncircumcised*): A disdainful term for enemies of Israel (see also *17:36*; *31:4*). • **Perhaps:** Jonathan had no guarantee of survival, but he was certain that God could grant them victory despite the odds. Victory was in God’s hands; Jonathan offered himself as an instrument God could use. • **many warriors or only a few:** Jonathan knew what Gideon had learned many years earlier (see *Judg 7:2-8*).\n\n
14:11	idm33587					 **Hebrews:** See *study note on 13:3*. • **crawling out of their holes:** See *13:6*.\n\n
14:15	idm33597					 **panic broke out:** This parallel with the Gideon story depicts Jonathan as a judge-like figure (cp. *Judg 7:19-22*). God had not anointed or expressly gifted Jonathan to be leader, yet God used him to rescue his people. • **raiding parties:** See *study note on 1 Sam 13:17-18*.\n\n
14:18	idm33607					 **Bring . . . Israelites:** See NLT textual note; the Greek text is likely original. The Ark remained at Kiriath-jearim for twenty years (*7:2*), and it was never used for getting information about the future, as the ephod was (see *study note on 2:18*).\n\n
14:21	idm33616					 **Previously***,* a large group of Israelites had gone into **hiding** out of fear (*13:6-7*). Others might have joined **the Philistine army**. However, the statement that they **revolted** when the opportunity arose suggests they might have been taken as prisoners of war and forced into the Philistines’ service.\n\n
14:23	idm33628					 It was God, not Saul, who **saved Israel***;* Jonathan was just a willing instrument in the Lord’s hands. • **Beth-aven** was due west of Micmash (see *13:5*). The Israelites forced the Philistines to retreat all the way to Aijalon that day (see *14:31*).\n\n
14:24	idm33639					 With his **oath***,* Saul forced abstinence from food on men who were already hungry and exhausted from battle. This oath was probably a pagan-like attempt to manipulate God into giving them a favorable result (cp. notes on *Exod 23:26*; *25:22*; *32:4*). • That Saul said **my enemies** rather than “our enemies” reflects his self-centered pride.\n\n
14:29	idm33651					 **made trouble:** Joshua had used this verb in speaking with Achan (*Josh 7:25*), and Jephthah had used it with his innocent daughter (*Judg 11:35*). Saul’s foolish oath limited Israel’s victory (*1 Sam 14:30*) and put his son’s life at risk (see also *Josh 6:18*; *1 Chr 2:7*).\n\n
14:31	idm33663					 **Aijalon:** If the Philistines fled along the likely route through Beth-horon, then the Israelites kept up the pursuit for close to twenty miles.\n\n
14:32	idm33670					 The men were famished, so they ate meat **without draining the blood.** This act violated God’s law (see *Lev 17:10-14*) and thus constituted **sinning against the** Lord. To prevent more sin, Saul used a large rock as a field altar so that the animals’ blood could be properly drained. The incident would never have occurred had it not been for Saul’s foolish oath.\n\n
14:35	idm33680					 **first of the altars:** This altar is the only one mentioned. David later built an altar that would become the site of God’s Temple (*2 Sam 24:18-25*).\n\n
14:37	idm33688					 **God made no reply:** Neither the “no” lot nor the “yes” lot of the Urim and Thummim appeared.\n\n
14:41	idm33695					 Casting **sacred lots** involved the Urim and Thummim (*Exod 28:30*; *Lev 8:8*), which David also used when soliciting God’s guidance (*1 Sam 23:2*; *30:8*; *2 Sam 2:1*). The Urim and Thummim were two small objects (perhaps flat stones, sticks, or arrows) that may have been cast like dice. They would provide a positive answer, a neutral response, or a negative answer.\n\n
14:45	idm33707					 **The people***,* aware of God’s blessing on the real hero of the day, were wiser than their king.\n\n
14:47	idm33715					 In contrast to the folly described in *14:1-46*, these verses summarize Saul’s military successes. A similar summary of achievements ends the description of each king’s reign in 1 Samuel—2 Kings.\n\n
14:47	idm33722					 **secured his grasp:** Samuel had used this verb repeatedly when speaking about what a king would do: “He will take . . . take . . . take” (*8:10-18*). • **Moab, Ammon, Edom, . . . Zobah:** David confronted these same foes during his reign and expanded Israel’s territory in the process (see *2 Sam 8:1-14*).\n\n
14:48	idm33732					 **conquered the Amalekites:** See *15:1-35*. The Amalekites, a nomadic group in the south, periodically raided and pillaged Israel (see *Exod 17:8-16*; *Num 14:45*; *Judg 3:13*; *6:3*, *33*; *7:12*; *10:12*).\n\n
14:49	idm33747					 This information about Saul’s family, placed here rather than at the end of his reign, hints that his reign was essentially over and he would not be succeeded by one of his sons.\n\n
14:49	idm33753					 **Saul’s sons included:** Another of Saul’s sons was named Abinadab (*31:2*). • **Ishbosheth** means “man of shame” (see *study note on 2 Sam 2:8*). He was also called Esh-baal (“man of Baal”). He served briefly as a rival king over the northern tribes during David’s early years (*2 Sam 2:8-11*).\n\n
14:50	idm33764					 **Ahinoam** is mentioned only here in Saul’s story. In *25:43*, David marries a woman also called Ahinoam (who might or might not have been the same person; cp. *2 Sam 12:8*).\n\n
14:52	idm33773					 Saul had easily defeated the Ammonites (*11:11*) but was having much less success with **the Philistines***,* given their well-organized fighting machine and their monopoly on iron and bronze (*13:19-22*). • **he drafted him:** Samuel had warned earlier that the king would take people as well as possessions (*8:11*).\n\n
15:1	idm33785					 After Saul failed to obey God and completely destroy the Amalekites, God rejected him in even stronger terms than before (cp. *13:8-14*).\n\n
15:2	idm33792					 Lord** of Heaven’s Armies:** See *study note on 1:3*. • **to settle accounts:** In Moses’ time, **the nation of Amalek** had inhabited southern Judah and the Negev area south of Judah. As Israel traveled to Canaan, the Amalekites preyed on the sick and the weak and those traveling at the rear. They were the first people to attack Israel after the exodus from Egypt, for which God had promised to judge them (*Exod 17:8-16*; *Deut 25:17-19*).\n\n
15:3	idm33805					 **completely destroy:** See “*Complete Dedication*” Theme Note.\n\n
15:4	idm33813					 **Telaim:** Possibly Telem (*Josh 15:24*).\n\n
15:5	idm33821					 The unnamed town **in the valley** was located somewhere near a Negev *wadi,* a streambed or riverbed that fills with water only when rain falls.\n\n
15:6	idm33829					 **The Kenites** were nomadic metalworkers and descendants of Moses’ father-in-law (*Judg 1:16*). • **you showed kindness:** See *Exod 18*; *Num 10:29-32*.\n\n
15:7	idm33840					 The area where the Amalekites lived stretched **from Havilah** in northern Sinai** to Shur** near the eastern border **of Egypt**.\n\n
15:8	idm33849					 **Agag** was probably the descendant of an earlier king by the same name (see *Num 24:7*; cp. *Esth 3:1*).\n\n
15:9	idm33858					 **Saul and his men** directly disobeyed the Lord’s command to “completely destroy” the Amalekites (*15:3*). Though the entire army participated in the disobedience of God’s command, Saul alone was responsible as their leader.\n\n
15:12	idm33866					 **Carmel** was a town near Hebron in southern Judah. • **Saul** commemorated his own accomplishments by erecting **a monument to himself**. In reality, he had earned shame (*15:16-19*). • **Gilgal:** See *13:4*.\n\n
15:13	idm33878					 **I have carried out the** Lord**’s command!** Cp. *15:3*. Saul apparently thought his actions were justified (*15:15*; cp. *Lev 22:19*). Samuel, however, cut through Saul’s pretense (*1 Sam 15:17-19*) and carried out God’s command himself (*15:32-33*).\n\n
15:15	idm33892					 Saul blamed **the army** even though he was the commander. Certainly, his real motivation was not spiritual (*15:9*).\n\n
15:17	idm33900					 As the **anointed . . . king of Israel***,* Saul bore the responsibility for disobeying God, which neither false humility nor making excuses could diminish.\n\n
15:21	idm33908					 **my troops:** Saul persisted in blaming others (see *15:15*). • **Gilgal** was a religious center. Saul tried to use religion to justify disobedience to God.\n\n
15:22	idm33917					 **What is more pleasing:** God values **obedience** much more than ritual (see also *Ps 40:6*; *Hos 6:6*; *Matt 12:7*). • **the fat of rams:** The choicest parts of the animal were offered to God.\n\n
15:23	idm33929					 **Rebellion . . . and stubbornness***,* sins of the heart, are as bad as the sinful practices of idolatrous pagans. • Scripture condemns **witchcraft** (see *study note on Deut 18:10*).\n\n
15:24	idm33939					 Saul finally confessed his sin. But it was too little, too late—and still accompanied by excuses.\n\n
15:24	idm33945					 **I was afraid of the people:** Saul continued to blame others (see *15:15*, *21*). • **what they demanded:** There is no hint of such pressure in the chapter. Saul’s confession appears dishonest (cp. David, *2 Sam 12:13*; *Ps 51*).\n\n
15:28	idm33957					 Saul soon discovered who this **someone else** was (*18:8-9*; cp. ch *16*).\n\n
15:29	idm33966					 **nor will he change his mind:** Samuel spoke prophetically of God’s commitment to make David king and to preserve his dynasty. God had rejected Saul, but he would never reject David (see *2 Sam 7:8-17*).\n\n
15:30	idm33974					 **honor me before the elders:** To help Saul save face.\n\n
15:35	idm33981					 The verb phrase **mourned constantly** is usually used for grieving over someone’s death. Although Saul was still living, his royalty was coming to an end. Samuel might have been grieving out of personal attachment to Saul, a sense of failure, or concern that Israel’s condition would be worse. • **the** Lord** was sorry:** See “*God’s Change of Mind*” Theme Note.\n\n
16:1	idm33992					 David was Saul’s replacement. There are striking similarities between the two: Samuel anointed both. Neither was pursuing the position. Both were unlikely candidates (Saul was from the smallest tribe; David was the youngest son). Both were impressive in appearance (*9:2*; *16:12*). And the Spirit came mightily on each when he was anointed king (*10:10*; *11:6*; *16:13*). The key difference was that David was “a man after [God’s] own heart” (*13:14*; cp. *16:7*), while Saul was not.\n\n
16:1	idm34005					 **mourned long enough:** See *study note on 15:35*. • **Bethlehem** was about five miles south of Jerusalem. It was later known as the City of David (*Luke 2:11*) and the birthplace of Jesus. • **Jesse** was the grandson of Boaz and Ruth (*Ruth 4:22*). • **I have selected:** This Hebrew verb implies that God had seen **one of [Jesse’s] sons** and based his choice on what he saw. God, the eternal king, knows better than the people of Israel how to choose a good **king** to serve the nation, and he provided a replacement for Saul who would lead Israel well.\n\n
16:2	idm34020					 **say that you have come to make a sacrifice:** God sometimes leads his servants into dangerous situations. He protects his own—sometimes by miracle, sometimes by strategy (cp. *Exod 3:18-22*). In Samuel’s role as a priestly judge, he would not have raised any suspicions by offering a sacrifice (see *1 Sam 10:8*).\n\n
16:4	idm34029					 **the elders . . . came trembling:** News of Samuel’s rebuke of Saul and execution of Agag had likely reached Bethlehem.\n\n
16:5	idm34036					 **Purify yourselves:** Self-purification included bathing and abstaining from sexual intercourse (see *Exod 19:10-15*; cp. *Gen 35:2-4*). • **The sacrifice** likely took place the following morning (see *Num 11:18*; *Josh 3:5*; *7:13-14*). • **Samuel performed the purification rite for Jesse and his sons** to make sure they were ready for the sacrifice and for the anointing of the new king (cp. *Exod 19:10*; *Josh 3:5*).\n\n
16:6	idm34052					 **his appearance or height:** Like Saul, **Eliab***,* Jesse’s oldest son, had an impressive outward appearance (cp. *9:2*). Also like Saul, he was **rejected** (cp. *15:23*). God had another man in mind to anoint as king. • **the** Lord **looks at the heart:** God can give a new heart (*10:9*), touch hearts (*10:26*), and peer into the deep motivations of the heart (*Ps 139:1*). God sees what people cannot see—a person’s true character. Eliab’s character comes out in *1 Sam 17:28*.\n\n
16:13	idm34071					 **The Spirit of the** Lord** came . . . upon David,** as was consistently evident (e.g., *16:23*; *17:48-54*; *18:5*, *12-16*). The Spirit of the Lord had also come upon Saul (*10:10*) but had left him because of disobedience (*16:14*). • **Ramah:** Samuel’s hometown (*1:1*).\n\n
16:14	idm34088					 Saul’s kingship continued its downward spiral after God’s Spirit departed from him. His reign ended in shame and defeat (ch *31*).\n\n
16:14	idm34095					 **Spirit . . . left Saul:** In contrast with David’s receiving the Spirit (see “*The Spirit’s Presence*” Theme Note). • **The** Lord** sent a tormenting spirit** as a consequence of Saul’s disobedience (see also *18:10*; *19:9*; cp. *Judg 9:23*; *Rom 1:28-29*).\n\n
16:18	idm34110					 **harp:** The instrument was probably a lyre (as in *10:5*). • **the** Lord** is with him:** People recognized that God’s Spirit was upon David (*16:13*).\n\n
16:21	idm34122					 Although at first **Saul loved David very much***,* this love soon turned to intense jealousy and hatred (see *18:8-14*). • An **armor bearer** in ancient Israel served as the personal attendant of a warrior chieftain (see *14:1-15*; *31:4-6*; *Judg 9:54*; *2 Sam 18:15*).\n\n
16:22	idm34136					 David’s father, **Jesse** (*16:18*), arranged for David to continue serving Saul while still fulfilling his shepherding duties at home (see *17:14-15*).\n\n
16:23	idm34145					 **Saul would feel better:** David was more than a handsome lad gifted in music; he was the anointed king. Here David illustrated what a king should be: one who brings relief. Later, David composed dozens of psalms that have brought comfort and relief through the ages. • **the tormenting spirit would go away:** Even those who are disobedient and rejected can receive relief and comfort through the Lord’s servant.\n\n
17:1	idm34153					 **The Philistines** presented an ongoing threat throughout Saul’s reign (see *14:47-52*). • **Socoh in Judah** was fourteen miles west of Bethlehem toward Philistine territory. • **Azekah** was a few miles northwest of Socoh (the precise location of **Ephes-dammim** is unknown). The Philistines were encroaching on Israelite territory.\n\n
17:2	idm34164					 The **valley of Elah** was a fertile area that ran east–west, fifteen miles southwest of Bethlehem.\n\n
17:4	idm34171					 **champion:** In ancient times, rival forces would sometimes agree to let selected individuals from each side decide a conflict. This reduced casualties and other costs. The same kind of combat is reflected in *2 Sam 2:12-17*. • **Gath** was one of five Philistine cities with a reputation for having giants as citizens (*2 Sam 21:15-22*).\n\n
17:5	idm34181					 Although Goliath was a fully armored warrior of terrifying size, he did not have God—a far mightier warrior—on his side (*17:45-47*).\n\n
17:12	idm34188					 **Ephrathite:** Ephrath is a name for Bethlehem (*Gen 35:19*; *1 Chr 4:4*).\n\n
17:15	idm34197					 **went back and forth:** David apparently served as a musician and armor bearer in Saul’s court (see *16:19-23*) while maintaining his duties at home. The intermittent nature of David’s service might explain why Saul was unfamiliar with David during the encounter with Goliath (see *17:55-58*).\n\n
17:26	idm34206					 **What will a man get:** Cp. *18:17-27*. David’s interest in a reward was overshadowed by his determination to silence Goliath’s defiance of God (*17:45-47*). • **pagan:** Literally *uncircumcised.* See *study note on 14:6*.\n\n
17:28	idm34218					 **Eliab . . . was angry***,* perhaps resentful that David, rather than he, was anointed to be king (*16:6-13*).\n\n
17:32	idm34227					 **I’ll go fight him!** David’s courage stands in contrast to Saul’s fear (*17:11*).\n\n
17:40	idm34235					 A **stream** flowed through the valley of Elah (*17:2*). • A **sling** was a leather pouch attached to two leather thongs. When the sling containing a stone was whirled rapidly, one of the thongs could be released, sending the stone toward its target. David probably became deadly accurate with a sling as a shepherd, but the sling was used by warriors as well (*Judg 20:16*).\n\n
17:42	idm34245					 **ruddy-faced:** The same Hebrew word is translated “dark” (*16:12*) and “very red” (*Gen 25:25*). Here, it emphasizes David’s youthfulness and inexperience. • **boy:** Saul had expressed similar disbelief (*1 Sam 17:33*). As a champion, Goliath expected to be met by an Israelite warrior of similar rank.\n\n
17:43	idm34256					 **a dog:** A metaphor for a compliant, bowing servant (cp. *2 Sam 9:8*). • **a stick:** David had concealed his sling, and Goliath could see only his staff. • **by the names of his gods:** Since Goliath appealed to his gods, David’s victory over Goliath would also symbolize God’s victory over Dagon, the chief god of the Philistines (*1 Sam 5:2*, *5*).\n\n
17:44	idm34268					 A corpse left to scavengers such as **birds and wild animals** was grievously cursed (cp. *Deut 21:23*; *28:26*).\n\n
17:45	idm34277					 **the** Lord** of Heaven’s Armies:** See *study note on 1:3*. Despite the Philistines’ apparent military advantage, David knew that Israel had the supreme advantage in the one true God.\n\n
17:49	idm34287					 Goliath’s **forehead** remained exposed beneath his enormous helmet. • **stumbled and fell face down:** The stone only incapacitated Goliath; David killed him by decapitating him (*17:51*).\n\n
17:52	idm34296					 The Israelites chased the Philistines to **Gath,** some six miles to the west. • **Ekron** was a Philistine city five miles north of Gath. • **Shaaraim** was a city of Judah near Azekah (*17:1*).\n\n
17:53	idm34306					 Unless expressly prohibited (e.g., *15:3*; *Josh 6:18*), victory in battle allowed for the taking of war spoils (*Deut 2:35*; *Josh 8:2*).\n\n
17:54	idm34316					 **Jerusalem** became an Israelite city later, when David captured it from the Jebusites (*2 Sam 5:6-7*). Jerusalem was probably the final destination of Goliath’s head, after David had become king. But David might have taken it to Jerusalem earlier to intimidate the non-Israelite occupants.\n\n
17:55	idm34324					 In light of *16:14-23*, it is surprising that neither Saul nor Abner knew who David was. It is possible that the events of ch *17* happened either before or long after David’s tenure of intermittent service mentioned in ch *16* (Saul probably served as king for forty-two years, *13:1*).\n\n
18:1	idm34334					 **David** and **Jonathan** had much in common: both were young and capable, were military heroes, had a robust faith in God, and had a claim to the throne of Israel. It is a testimony to Jonathan’s true character that he recognized and supported God’s choice of David to be the next king of Israel (see *18:3-4*; *20:12-17*). • **Jonathan loved David:** See *20:17*; *2 Sam 1:26*. Others in this chapter are also said to love David: all Israel and Judah (*1 Sam 18:16*), Saul’s daughter Michal (*18:20*), and Saul’s servants (*18:22*). Some modern interpreters see a homosexual relationship between David and Jonathan, but the text implies nothing other than a deep and loyal friendship.\n\n
18:2	idm34350					 David had previously served Saul part-time (see *17:15* and *corresponding study note*); now **Saul kept David with him** full-time.\n\n
18:3	idm34359					 Out of his love for David and recognition that God had chosen David to be Israel’s next king (see *20:13-17*, *30-31*; *23:17*), **Jonathan made a solemn pact** of friendship with David. By giving David items that symbolized his official status as the king’s son and crown prince, Jonathan symbolically gave David his right of succession to the throne.\n\n
18:7	idm34369					 **thousands . . . ten thousands:** This dramatic increase in number between two lines of Hebrew poetry was a way of intensifying the statement (cp. *Deut 32:30*; *Ps 91:7*). Because of his great military victories, David was beginning to eclipse Saul (*1 Sam 18:16*, *30*; *21:11*).\n\n
18:8	idm34381					 Saul came to view David as a threat rather than an ally and would do anything to get rid of him.\n\n
18:11	idm34387					 In his jealousy and fear, Saul would have been happier with one dead David than with thousands of dead Philistines (*18:7*).\n\n
18:12	idm34394					 **the** Lord** . . . had turned away from Saul** as king as punishment for his disobedience. Saul’s kingship would fail, and David’s would succeed (*18:14*).\n\n
18:17	idm34404					 **Saul** offered his **older daughter, Merab***,* to David. But it was an insincere gesture.\n\n
18:17	idm34413					 Saul had promised his **daughter** to anyone who could slay Goliath (*17:25*; cp. *Josh 15:16*; *Judg 1:12*), but he tacked on additional risks for David (see also *1 Sam 18:21*, *25*).\n\n
18:18	idm34425					 **Who am I, and what is my family:** An expression of humility (see also *2 Sam 7:18*; cp. *Exod 3:11*). David’s family could not afford the bride price to marry the king’s daughter (*1 Sam 18:23-25*).\n\n
18:19	idm34435					 **So:** Or *But.* Either David declined the offer, or Saul reneged.\n\n
18:22	idm34443					 **really likes you:** The same Hebrew word describes Jonathan’s love for David (*18:3*; *19:1-2*, “strong affection”). Here, it was completely untrue.\n\n
18:23	idm34452					 The future son-in-law would give the **bride price** as a gift to his bride’s father (see *Gen 34:12*; *Exod 22:16-17*).\n\n
18:29	idm34461					 **even more afraid:** Saul’s fear was unfounded. Although he made himself **David’s enemy***,* David consistently honored Saul as king (see chs *24*, *26*).\n\n
19:4	idm34472					 **Jonathan** addressed his father as **the king** out of reverence.\n\n
19:6	idm34480					 **vowed:** Violating a vow is a serious offense against God (see *Num 30:2*; *Deut 23:21-23*; cp. *Eccl 5:4-5*). But Saul soon disregarded his promise and again sought to kill David (*1 Sam 19:9-24*).\n\n
19:10	idm34491					 **hurled his spear:** See also *18:11*; *20:33*.\n\n
19:11	idm34500					 See *Ps 59:title*.\n\n
19:13	idm34508					 **an idol:** Hebrew *teraphim**,* which were household idols (see *Gen 31:30*; *Judg 17:5*; *2 Kgs 23:24*). The presence of an idol in the home of David and Michal might show the pervasive influence of pagan idol worship among the Israelites; perhaps the idol belonged to Michal. Apparently David did not object to its presence. (Cp. Rachel’s theft of her father’s household idols in *Gen 31:19*.) • Siblings Jonathan (*1 Sam 19:1-7*) and Michal (*19:11-18*) saved David from their father and undermined their father’s plans to eliminate him. Members of Saul’s royal family played a significant role in David’s rise, though David did not usurp Saul’s throne.\n\n
19:18	idm34523					 **Ramah:** Samuel’s hometown (*1:1*). • **Naioth** was a tiny village not far from the other Ramah in Benjamin.\n\n
19:20	idm34532					 **Prophets** often assembled in groups under a single leader (see *2 Kgs 2:15*; *4:38*; *6:1-7*). • The **Spirit of God came upon Saul’s men** to allow David to escape (*1 Sam 20:1*).\n\n
19:21	idm34544					 **other troops . . . a third time:** Each time Saul sent troops, David’s would-be captors were captured by the Spirit. Prophesying diverted them from pursuing David.\n\n
19:24	idm34551					 When Saul **tore off his clothes and lay naked***,* he unwittingly acted out his true spiritual condition of having been stripped of the kingship (*13:14*; *15:10-11*, *23*; see “*Prophetic Sign Acts*” Theme Note). • **Is even Saul a prophet?** In *1 Sam 10:9-13*, Saul was rising as God’s chosen king; here, he is descending under the weight of God’s rejection.\n\n
20:2	idm34565					 **Jonathan** was naive about his father’s intentions. David’s willingness to **swear . . . by the** Lord showed how convinced he was about Saul’s intentions.\n\n
20:5	idm34574					 **new moon festival:** The ancient Hebrews followed a lunar calendar, and the new moon marked the start of a new month. Every month was begun with a special sacrifice (*Num 28:11-15*), which became a monthly festival.\n\n
20:6	idm34582					 Israelite families might designate one of the new moon festivals as an opportunity for **an annual family sacrifice** (see, e.g., *1:3*).\n\n
20:8	idm34590					 **Loyalty** (Hebrew *khesed*) denotes faithfulness between covenant partners. • **a solemn pact:** See *18:3*; *20:16*.\n\n
20:13	idm34601					 **may the** Lord** strike me:** Jonathan invoked a curse upon himself to reassure David that he would keep his promise. • **as he used to be with my father:** Jonathan recognized that David had received the blessing from God that his father had once had. The divine favor that had brought Saul into royal office (*9:14–10:1*) would bring David into royal office as Saul’s replacement. Jonathan accepted this even though he was the natural successor to Saul.\n\n
20:14	idm34612					 **faithful love:** Hebrew *khesed* (see *study note on 20:8*). Jonathan was reminding David to keep his commitment to him when he became king. It was reasonable for Jonathan to be concerned that David might kill any descendant of Saul who could make a rival claim to his throne. Saul later made a similar request of David (*24:21*).\n\n
20:15	idm34622					 **treat my family:** David later treated Jonathan’s son, Mephibosheth, as one of his own sons (*2 Sam 9:1-13*).\n\n
20:17	idm34630					 See *18:3*; *23:16-18*.\n\n
20:18	idm34638					 Jonathan’s ruse would allow David to get the message even if there could be no face-to-face meeting; the boy’s presence would allay suspicion and provide Jonathan an alibi for going to the field. As it happened, no one but the boy accompanied Jonathan to the field, so when the boy left, David was able to speak with Jonathan face to face (*20:40-42*).\n\n
20:25	idm34645					 **Abner** was Saul’s cousin and served as commander of Saul’s army (*14:50*; *17:55*). His importance is indicated by his position **beside** the king at this festival.\n\n
20:26	idm34655					 A number of circumstances could render a person **ceremonially unclean** and thus unfit for attending a sacred festival (see *Lev 7:20-21*). Often, an unclean person was required to be excluded from such functions only until the evening of the same day (*Lev 15*). This explains why Saul became suspicious after David did not arrive **the next day**. • Saul referred to David as **the son of Jesse** (also in *1 Sam 20:31*; *22:7*), a description that functioned as David’s surname.\n\n
20:29	idm34668					 **get away:** This verb also describes David’s earlier escape from Saul (*19:10-12*, *17-18*).\n\n
20:30	idm34677					 **You stupid son of a whore!** This epithet was as strong and insulting in Hebrew as it is in English. • **shaming yourself:** Saul was interested in the legacy of his own dynasty. He viewed David’s actions as ultimately directed against Jonathan, the hereditary successor. To Saul, Jonathan was stupidly hurting and *shaming* himself by supporting David.\n\n
20:33	idm34686					 **hurled his spear at Jonathan:** See also *18:11*; *19:10*. • **at last Jonathan realized:** Jonathan had been reluctant to believe the truth about his own father (*20:2-3*), but he could no longer deny it.\n\n
20:41	idm34697					 **David bowed:** Jonathan had the higher social rank, so David’s homage was fitting. • **Both of them were in tears:** For the first time, the record of the emotion between these two men shows mutuality (see *18:1*, *3-4*; *20:17*).\n\n
20:42	idm34708					 **sworn loyalty to each other in the** Lord**’s name:** See *18:3*; *20:15-17*; *23:16-18*.\n\n
21:1	idm34720					 **Nob** was just north of Jerusalem, in the southern part of the territory of Benjamin. • **Ahimelech the priest** was a descendant of the condemned family of Eli (*14:3*; *22:9*). • The elders of Bethlehem had also **trembled** when Samuel unexpectedly came to their city to anoint David as Saul’s replacement (*16:4*). On both occasions, a prominent individual who had strained relations with Saul showed up unannounced. Both Ahimelech and the Bethlehem elders were concerned about being suspected of supporting an enemy of the king, which could result in death. In this case, what was feared came about (see *22:9-19*).\n\n
21:2	idm34733					 **The king has sent me:** David lied to conceal his outlaw status and to dispel Ahimelech’s worries.\n\n
21:4	idm34740					 Only priests were permitted to partake of **holy bread** (see *Exod 25:22-30*; *Lev 24:5-9*), and only within the sacred precincts. • **slept with any women:** The consecrated bread was to be eaten only by the ritually pure, so the priest verified that David’s men were free from ritual impurity caused by sexual activity (see *Lev 15:16-18*). Typically, such bread would not be available for consumption by laity. The priest made an exception in this case probably because he sensed the men’s physical needs and he believed they were on a royal mission.\n\n
21:6	idm34751					 **gave him the holy bread:** Jesus referred to this incident to teach that meeting people’s physical needs takes precedence over rigid adherence to sacred institutions (see *Matt 12:1-8*; *Mark 2:23-28*; *Luke 6:1-5*). • **The Bread of the Presence** consisted of twelve loaves (possibly one representing each tribe) that were laid out on a table in the Holy Place. They were **replaced** every Sabbath (see *Exod 25:30*; *Lev 24:5-9*).\n\n
21:7	idm34765					 **having been detained before the** Lord**:** Ahimelech sought guidance from God on others’ behalf (*22:15*), so it is possible that **Doeg** was awaiting a response to an inquiry.\n\n
21:9	idm34776					 **The sword of Goliath***,* which David used to decapitate the giant (*17:51*), had been taken as war spoils, as had Goliath’s head (*17:54*). • The **ephod** mentioned here might not have been the priestly garment of the same name; some passages give the impression that an ephod could also be a statue (*Judg 8:27*; *18:17*).\n\n
21:10	idm34789					 **Gath***,* a major Philistine city and the hometown of Goliath, was a clever but dangerous place for David to seek refuge from Saul.\n\n
21:11	idm34797					 **the king of the land:** David’s reputation as a mighty warrior even greater than King Saul (see *18:7*) had grown to the point where foreigners began referring to him as Israel’s king.\n\n
21:12	idm34805					 The lengthy title of *Ps 34* refers to this incident but names the Philistine king Abimelech rather than **Achish**. “Abimelech” might have been the common title for Philistine kings (in Hebrew it means “my father the king”). The name Abimelech also appears in *Gen 20:2*; *26:1*.\n\n
22:1	idm34815					 Saul’s character becomes evident here. Unable to exact revenge on David himself, Saul slaughtered those he believed to be guilty of giving aid and comfort to David.\n\n
22:1	idm34821					 **Adullam** was some sixteen miles southwest of Jerusalem, near Philistine territory. • Had David’s **brothers and all his other relatives** stayed in Bethlehem, they would have been vulnerable to Saul’s revenge.\n\n
22:2	idm34829					 **in trouble . . . in debt . . .** **discontented:** By attracting such down-and-out people to himself, David foreshadowed Jesus, who would attract to himself the hurting, the burdened, and the outcast (*Matt 11:25-30*).\n\n
22:3	idm34838					 **Mizpeh in Moab** lay east of the Dead Sea and the Jordan River—not an easy trip from Adullam, especially if the 400 men (*22:2*) accompanied David. • **David’s parents stayed in Moab:** Jesse’s grandmother was Ruth, a Moabite (*Ruth 4:13-22*).\n\n
22:5	idm34848					 The **prophet Gad** was David’s special adviser (*2 Sam 24:11*). God was no longer communicating with Saul but was guiding David.\n\n
22:7	idm34856					 **men of Benjamin:** Saul was suspicious of his own tribesmen, believing that David had bought their loyalty. Worse, Saul did not even trust his **own son***,* convinced that he had joined the supposed conspiracy.\n\n
22:13	idm34865					 David had deceived Ahimelech into thinking he was on a mission for Saul (*21:1-9*), so Saul’s accusations of conspiracy were baseless.\n\n
22:14	idm34872					 **your son-in-law:** David had married Saul’s daughter (*18:17-29*).\n\n
22:18	idm34880					 **Doeg the Edomite . . . killed them:** As a non-Israelite, Doeg had no concern for the sanctity of God-anointed priests. He knew he was executing innocent men. This evil foreigner partially fulfilled the prophecy about the condemned priestly line of Eli (*2:27-34*; see *1 Kgs 2:27*). • **still wearing their priestly garments:** This incident illustrates how mad Saul had become. Not even those holding a sacred office were safe.\n\n
22:19	idm34890					 Saul had been unwilling to carry out God’s orders to destroy completely the Amalekites and their possessions (*15:3*, *9*). Yet now, in his rage, he did not hesitate to decimate **the priests’ families** and their possessions (see *Prov 14:29*; *16:14*; *27:4*).\n\n
22:20	idm34902					 **Abiathar** became an adviser to David, providing guidance from the Lord through the ephod (*23:2-12*; *2 Sam 15:24-36*). Later, he conspired with Adonijah against David and Solomon (*1 Kgs 1–2*).\n\n
23:1	idm34912					 Thanks to informants (*23:7*, *13*), Saul was able to stay on David’s trail. David also had informants, allowing him to keep one step ahead of Saul (*23:1*, *9*, *15*, *25*). David’s chief advantage was access to divine guidance and resources (*23:2*, *4*, *12*), which Saul lacked.\n\n
23:1	idm34927					 **Keilah** was near Adullam (*22:1*) at the western edge of Judah, not far from the Philistine border (see *Josh 15:44*; *Neh 3:17-18*).\n\n
23:4	idm34937					 **David asked the** Lord either directly in prayer or by using the ephod (see *23:6*, *9*; *2 Sam 2:1*; *5:23-24*). God’s answers were a sign of his blessing and protection (cp. *1 Sam 28:6*).\n\n
23:6	idm34950					 **the ephod:** Saul had slain eighty-five priests who were wearing their ephods (*22:18*; see *study note on 2:18*), but the priest who escaped had the high priest’s ephod, which contained the Urim and Thummim.\n\n
23:7	idm34959					 **God has handed him over to me:** To the contrary, see *23:14*.\n\n
23:14	idm34967					 The **strongholds of the wilderness** were not man-made structures but natural rock formations that provided refuge. • **Ziph** was approximately ten miles southeast of Keilah (*23:1*).\n\n
23:16	idm34976					 **Jonathan . . . encouraged** David because he knew that God had chosen David to be king.\n\n
23:17	idm34983					 **You are going to be the king. . . I will be next to you** (literally *second to you*): Jonathan recognized God’s selection of David and renounced any personal ambition to the throne. Jonathan never occupied an official position in David’s court but was killed in battle along with his father (*31:2*).\n\n
23:18	idm34992					 **their solemn pact:** See *18:3-4*; *20:12-17*. • **Jonathan returned home:** This was probably the last time David and Jonathan saw each other.\n\n
23:19	idm35002					 **Hakilah** was a hill in the wilderness region of Ziph (*23:14*). • The term **Jeshimon** is sometimes translated as “wasteland” rather than as a place name. It refers here to a specific wasteland located north of the Dead Sea, on both banks of the Jordan River (see *Num 21:20*).\n\n
23:20	idm35012					 Both Keilah (*23:12*) and Ziph (*23:14*; *Ps 54:title*) were located in Judah, but neither one provided sanctuary for David, a native of Judah. David’s ascension to power was not the result of his own tribe’s loyalty but because of the will of God.\n\n
23:24	idm35022					 **Maon** was about three miles directly south of the wilderness of Ziph (*23:14*), approximately ten miles south of Hebron. • The **Arabah Valley** is a deep rift stretching from above the Sea of Galilee down both sides of the Jordan River to the Dead Sea.\n\n
23:28	idm35031					 **the Rock of Escape:** It was not uncommon for a place name to commemorate thankfulness to God (e.g., *Gen 22:14*; *28:19*; *32:30*). The exact rock formation that received this name is unknown.\n\n
23:29	idm35041					 **David** traveled eastward from the area of Ziph (*23:14*) and took refuge in **the strongholds of En-gedi**. These rocky highlands were located on the western shore of the Dead Sea. There was an oasis in this region, making it an ideal place to find water and food.\n\n
24:2	idm35050					 **3,000 elite troops:** David’s force was outnumbered five to one (*23:13*).\n\n
24:4	idm35058					 David’s men believed, as Saul did, that if the circumstances seem right, **the** Lord** is telling you** through those circumstances what to do (cp. *23:7*). • Perhaps David was able to **cut off a piece of the hem of Saul’s robe** without being apprehended because Saul had taken off the robe and laid it aside, or perhaps he fell asleep in the cave.\n\n
24:5	idm35069					 **David’s conscience began bothering him** because he had dishonored God’s anointed king.\n\n
24:6	idm35076					 **The** Lord**’s anointed one** was not to be violated (*26:9*, *11*, *16*, *23*; *2 Sam 1:14*, *16*; *19:21*). David would not harm Saul even though God had anointed him to be the next king (*1 Sam 16:13*).\n\n
24:11	idm35093					 **my father***:* Saul was, in fact, David’s father-in-law (*18:27*). David was demonstrating his respect for the king and recalling a day when their relationship had been much friendlier.\n\n
24:12	idm35102					 **May the** Lord** judge:** There was no human authority to adjudicate between Saul and David (cp. *Gen 16:5*; *31:53*; *Exod 5:21*; *Judg 11:27*). • **Perhaps the** Lord** will punish you:** David rested in God’s will rather than trying to force God’s hand.\n\n
24:13	idm35118					 The **proverb** vindicates David and indicts Saul. David refrained from **evil deeds***,* such as killing Saul. Saul, however, repeatedly tried to kill David.\n\n
24:20	idm35127					 **I realize that you are surely going to be king:** This was Saul’s first open admission of the truth (cp. *23:17*).\n\n
24:21	idm35135					 **Now swear to me . . . you will not kill my family:** Having descendants was a way that Saul’s name would endure among the living. David had already sworn such an **oath** with Jonathan (*20:14-17*).\n\n
25:1	idm35144					 This episode about Nabal falls between two accounts in which Saul pursued David and David spared Saul’s life. Nabal was similar to Saul.\n\n
25:1	idm35150					 **Maon:** This town in southern Judah (see *study note on 23:24*) was likely Nabal’s home. The wilderness of Paran, located in the northern half of the Sinai Peninsula, was too far south. The wilderness of Paran served as a place of refuge (*Gen 21:21*; *1 Kgs 11:18*).\n\n
25:2	idm35160					 **Carmel** was a village near Maon, not to be confused with the famous mountain from the Elijah narrative in *1 Kgs 18*. It was in this village that Saul had erected his monument to celebrate victory over the Amalekites (*1 Sam 15:12*).\n\n
25:3	idm35169					 **Nabal:** See *25:25* for insight into the irony of his name. • Unlike her husband, **Abigail was a sensible** and wise person, as the narrative shows.\n\n
25:8	idm35178					 Sheep-shearing time for herdsmen was like harvest time for farmers, **a time of celebration** and thankfulness for blessings.\n\n
25:10	idm35185					 **son of Jesse:** Like Saul (*20:27*, *31*; *22:7*), Nabal used this designation disrespectfully.\n\n
25:21	idm35195					 **he has repaid me evil for good:** Cp. *24:17*.\n\n
25:26	idm35203					 Abigail began and ended (*25:31*) her plea by declaring that God had **kept you from murdering and taking vengeance:** David could have killed Nabal (and Saul), but he didn’t.\n\n
25:28	idm35211					 **a lasting dynasty:** See *2 Sam 7*. • **fighting the** Lord**’s battles:** David was known and loved for his victories over Israel’s enemies (*1 Sam 18:7*, *13*, *16*). • **have not done wrong:** This comment does not indicate that David was sinless, but rather that he was innocent in his quest for the throne (as *25:29-31* makes clear).\n\n
25:29	idm35227					 The phrase **like stones shot from a sling** is a fitting metaphor for David, considering his defeat of Goliath with a sling (*17:32-51*).\n\n
25:36	idm35235					 **like a king:** Nabal was like Saul (see *study note on 25:1-44*).\n\n
25:37	idm35243					 **Nabal** was so stunned by the revelation that **he had a stroke** or a heart attack.\n\n
25:39	idm35251					 Nabal’s death was God’s **punishment for his sin**. David could not be accused of vengeful murder. • David lost no time in asking Abigail **to become his wife**. She had already shown herself to be a woman of good sense, and she was also beautiful (*25:3*).\n\n
25:43	idm35260					 **Ahinoam** was also the name of Saul’s wife (*14:50*). If she was the same woman, then David took Saul’s widow after his death (*31:1-13*), which would make another parallel between Nabal and Saul. However, see *27:3*; *30:5*. • This **Jezreel** was a village in the vicinity of Maon, Ziph, and Carmel in Judah (*Josh 15:55-56*) and not the better-known northern city of Jezreel.\n\n
25:44	idm35273					 Saul’s motive for giving away **Michal** to another man was probably political, an attempt to remove any claim David might have on the throne by dissolving David’s marriage with a member of the royal family.\n\n
26:1	idm35280					 This was the last time Saul and David were together. The Ziphites told Saul for the second time where David was hiding (see *23:19-20*), and David spared Saul’s life a second time as he did in the cave at En-gedi (see ch *24*).\n\n
26:1	idm35288					 **Men from Ziph** had previously volunteered to capture David and hand him over to Saul (*23:19-20*). • **Hakilah . . . Jeshimon** is the same geographical location they had mentioned to Saul before (*23:19*). David had not moved far, probably because the hilly terrain was dotted with numerous caves, providing many good hiding places.\n\n
26:3	idm35298					 **Saul had come after** David again, despite his earlier remorse (*24:17-21*). Saul had become incapable of acting rationally or speaking truthfully.\n\n
26:5	idm35306					 **Abner son of Ner:** See *study note on 20:25*.\n\n
26:6	idm35314					 This is the only reference to **Ahimelech the Hittite**. • **Zeruiah** was David’s sister (*1 Chr 2:16*), so **Abishai** was David’s nephew. The sons of Zeruiah (Abishai, Joab, and Asahel) were three of David’s most faithful followers (e.g., *2 Sam 2:18*), but they sometimes caused David difficulty (see *2 Sam 3:39*; *16:10*; *19:22*).\n\n
26:8	idm35328					 **God has surely handed your enemy over to you:** Cp. *24:4*.\n\n
26:9	idm35336					 **the** Lord**’s anointed:** See *study note on 24:6*.\n\n
26:10	idm35346					 David was confident that God would judge between him and Saul just as he had done between him and Nabal (see *25:38*). Saul did **die . . . in battle** against the Philistines (*31:6*).\n\n
26:14	idm35355					 **Abner:** See *study note on 20:25*.\n\n
26:16	idm35363					 **deserve to die:** Death was the punishment for dereliction of duty.\n\n
26:17	idm35370					 **Is that you, my son David?** Cp. *24:16*.\n\n
26:19	idm35378					 **If the** Lord** has stirred you up against me:** David was perplexed by Saul’s behavior and concerned with the possibility of unintentional sin on his part. • **a human scheme:** Possibly a reference to Doeg (*22:9-10*). • **worship pagan gods:** The sentiment parallels *Ps 137:4*. Anyone who was exiled from the holy land was unable to worship the Lord by participating in sacrifice at the central sanctuary.\n\n
26:20	idm35391					 **a single flea:** Cp. *24:14*.\n\n
26:21	idm35399					 **I have sinned:** Saul had seen the error of his ways once before (*24:16-19*). David had no good reason to trust him this time (see *27:1*). • **I have been a fool:** This Hebrew term (*sakal**,* “play the fool,” see also *13:13*) is different from the word meaning “fool” (*nabal*) used in ch *25*. However, the two words have parallel meanings. Saul and Nabal are parallel figures.\n\n
26:23	idm35414					 David did not harm Saul (*24:6*; *26:9*) because Saul was **the** Lord**’s anointed one** (see *study note on 24:6*).\n\n
26:24	idm35426					 **may the** Lord** value my life, even as I have valued yours:** David could not count on Saul to reciprocate. Thus, his fate was in God’s hands.\n\n
26:25	idm35435					 **Saul returned home,** and this may have been David’s last personal encounter with him.\n\n
27:1	idm35442					 David fled to the Philistines to get away from Saul for good. Rather than killing Saul, David chose the dangerous life of a fugitive.\n\n
27:2	idm35448					 This was David’s second sojourn with **Achish***,* the Philistine king (see *21:10-15*). On both occasions, David lied to him (see *27:10*).\n\n
27:6	idm35458					 **Ziklag** was about twenty-two miles southwest of Gath. • **still belongs to the kings of Judah:** This note was written between Solomon’s death (931 BC) and the start of the Babylonian exile (586 BC).\n\n
27:8	idm35468					 **Geshurites . . . Girzites . . . Amalekites:** These groups, who lived on the edges of the southern desert, had been troublesome to both Philistines and Israelites. (On the Amalekites, see *14:48*; ch *15*; on the Geshurites, see *Josh 13:2*, *13*; *2 Sam 3:3*.) • **Shur** was somewhere east of Egypt (*1 Sam 15:7*; *Gen 16:7*; *20:1*; *25:18*).\n\n
27:9	idm35485					 **David did not leave one person alive:** At least some of these people were among those whom God had commanded Israel to destroy (see *15:3*; *28:18*; *Deut 25:17-19*; *Josh 13:13*).\n\n
27:10	idm35496					 David misled Achish by claiming his attacks were **against** his own people **of Judah** and two other related groups. The text does not commend David for lying to the foreign king, but neither does it condemn him. • The **Jerahmeelites** were a Semitic tribe in southern Judah (*1 Chr 2:9*, *25-27*, *33*, *42*). • **Kenites:** Moses’ father-in-law was a Kenite (*Judg 1:16*; *4:11*; see also *study note on 1 Sam 15:6*).\n\n
28:1	idm35513					 **another war:** Hostilities between Israel and the Philistines were now routine. In exchange for providing refuge, Achish expected David’s military involvement and cooperation.\n\n
28:3	idm35520					 Saul consulted the dead, a practice forbidden by God’s law (see *Lev 20:27*; *Deut 18:9-11*).\n\n
28:3	idm35528					 **banned from the land:** Saul had either expelled or killed most mediums, or he had merely outlawed the practice of necromancy (see *study note on 28:9*).\n\n
28:4	idm35536					 **Shunem***,* a border town in the territory of Issachar (*Josh 19:18*), overlooked the valley of Jezreel. • Mount **Gilboa** is at the east end of the valley of Jezreel. The mountain took its name from a nearby village.\n\n
28:6	idm35546					 **refused to answer:** Earlier, Saul had consulted the Lord **by sacred lots** with mixed results (*14:36-42*). God’s refusal to speak was a sign of his judgment (*14:37*; *Lam 2:9*; *Ezek 7:26*; *Amos 8:11-12*; *Mic 3:6-7*).\n\n
28:7	idm35560					 Excluded from God’s counsel, Saul resorted to illegitimate methods for finding God’s will. Saul had earlier prohibited the occult practice that he now engaged in himself (*28:3*). • **Endor** was on the boundary between Israel and Philistia; the area near Israel’s border was probably a safer location for a banned practice.\n\n
28:9	idm35568					 **outlawed:** Literally *cut off,* suggesting that Saul might have had most of the mediums executed.\n\n
28:12	idm35576					 It is not clear why seeing Samuel caused **the woman** to recognize **Saul**.\n\n
28:13	idm35584					 Saul asked the medium to describe what she saw that caused her to scream. She described a divine being, **a god** (Hebrew *’elohim*) **coming up**. Perhaps she observed a human figure with a godlike or angelic appearance, or her use of the term *god* might reflect a pagan belief that a person becomes *a god*—a spirit possessing supernatural abilities—after death.\n\n
28:15	idm35595					 **God has left me:** The same Hebrew term is used in *16:14* and *Judg 16:20*. • **won’t reply by prophets or dreams:** Cp. *1 Sam 28:6*.\n\n
28:16	idm35606					 Saul’s **enemy** was not David but the Lord himself.\n\n
28:17	idm35613					 **torn the kingdom from you:** See *15:28*.\n\n
28:18	idm35621					 **you refused:** Samuel’s message to Saul had not changed (cp. *15:19*).\n\n
28:19	idm35629					 **here with me:** In *Sheol,* the abode of the dead (cp. *2:6*, “the grave”; see also *Num 16:30-33*; *Job 17:1-16*; *Ps 49:11*; *Rev 1:18*).\n\n
28:24	idm35642					 **fattening a calf . . . dough . . . bread:** This meal was a major undertaking, a model of hospitality (cp. *Gen 18:5-7*). This meal the medium shared with Saul recalls the fine meal Samuel had shared with Saul (*1 Sam 9:22-24*) before he anointed Saul as king. That meal with God’s prophet marked the beginning of Saul’s kingship. This meal with a condemned spiritist came shortly before his death.\n\n
29:1	idm35651					 David was spared by divine providence from actually fighting against his own people.\n\n
29:1	idm35657					 **Aphek** was the site of an earlier confrontation between Israel and the Philistines (*4:1*). • **Jezreel** was about forty miles northeast of Aphek.\n\n
29:3	idm35666					 **servant of King Saul:** To Achish, David was a valued defector. The other Philistine rulers suspected that David was a plant, planning to mount an attack from within the Philistine defenses. • **never found a single fault:** This was the first of three times that Achish defended David (see also *29:6*, *9*). Yet David had been deceiving Achish the whole time (see *27:1-12*).\n\n
29:4	idm35677					 **handing our heads over:** The commanders’ fears were justified (cp. *17:51*; *18:27*).\n\n
29:5	idm35686					 This jingle referred to slain Philistines (*18:7*). It is remarkable that David could find refuge in their midst.\n\n
29:6	idm35693					 **by the** Lord**:** Achish used the unique name of Israel’s God to prove his own sincerity. • **a trustworthy ally:** This assertion was not completely true, though Achish did not realize it (*27:8-12*).\n\n
30:1	idm35704					 **Ziklag:** See *study note on 27:6*. • Perhaps the **Amalekites** were retaliating for David’s raids against them (*27:8*).\n\n
30:2	idm35714					 There were no fighting men left in Ziklag to protect **the women and children**. The Amalekites had a reputation for preying on the weak and vulnerable (see *Deut 25:17-18*). • **without killing anyone:** The Amalekites were not being compassionate; women and children were more useful alive than dead.\n\n
30:5	idm35723					 **Ahinoam:** See *study note on 25:43*. • **Abigail:** See *25:3-42*.\n\n
30:6	idm35733					 **in great danger:** Saul had used the same expression about himself: When “in deep trouble” (*28:15*), Saul turned to necromancy, with disastrous results. David, by contrast, **found strength** and success **in the** Lord** his God**.\n\n
30:7	idm35745					 **the ephod:** See study notes on *2:18*; *23:6*.\n\n
30:8	idm35754					 Unlike Saul (*28:6*), David inquired of the Lord successfully (see *23:9-12*; *2 Sam 2:1*; *5:19*, *23*).\n\n
30:9	idm35765					 **Besor** was a large **brook** in Philistine territory that emptied into the Mediterranean southwest of Gaza.\n\n
30:10	idm35773					 **too exhausted:** David’s men had traveled for three days (*30:1*) and were now in hot pursuit of the Amalekites without having rested. David did not upbraid them or drive them on mercilessly. See *30:23-25*.\n\n
30:11	idm35782					 David had once received **bread** when he was famished (*21:3-7*). He and his men helped this **Egyptian man** before they even knew his identity or his ability to help their cause.\n\n
30:13	idm35791					 **because I was sick:** Only healthy and vigorous slaves were valuable to the Amalekites; the rest were expendable.\n\n
30:14	idm35798					 The **land of Caleb** was in the wilderness of Judah, south of Hebron (see *Josh 14:6-15*).\n\n
30:17	idm35806					 The total number of Amalekite raiders must have been quite large if **400 young men** escaped.\n\n
30:21	idm35813					 David generously divided the spoils among those who participated in the battle and those who were too exhausted to take part.\n\n
30:21	idm35819					 **greeted them joyfully:** David did not reprimand them for not participating in the battle.\n\n
30:22	idm35826					 **tell them to be gone:** This heartless group wanted to drive away the nonparticipants with no reward.\n\n
30:23	idm35833					 **what the** Lord** has given:** Some of David’s men ascribed success to their own military prowess; David attributed victory to God and gave him the glory.\n\n
30:24	idm35842					 **share and share alike:** Cp. *Num 31:25-47*, where Moses divided the plunder of war between those who fought and the rest of the people.\n\n
30:26	idm35850					 **elders of Judah . . . his friends:** David extended his generosity to influential people throughout his own tribal area, possibly to secure their support for him as king.\n\n
30:27	idm35857					 The places mentioned here were all in southern Judah. David eventually emerged from this territory as king (see *2 Sam 2:1-4*).\n\n
30:31	idm35864					 From **Hebron***,* David reigned as king over Judah for 7½ years (*2 Sam 2:1-7*; *5:5*).\n\n
31:1	idm35874					 While David was in the south successfully fighting the Amalekites (ch *30*), Saul was in the north unsuccessfully fighting the Philistines.\n\n
31:1	idm35881					 The Israelites **fled** southeast from the Jezreel Valley (*29:1*) to higher and hillier ground. With their chariots, the Philistines had the advantage in the more level valley. • **Mount Gilboa** is southwest of the Sea of Galilee, far from the territory of the Philistines.\n\n
31:2	idm35890					 **Jonathan . . . Malkishua:** See *14:49*. This is the first mention of Saul’s son **Abinadab** (cp. *1 Chr 8:33*; *9:39*).\n\n
31:4	idm35901					 David had once held the position of **armor bearer** (*16:21*). • **kill me:** This is one of many parallels between the death of Abimelech in the time of the judges (*Judg 9*) and Saul, Israel’s first national king (cp. *Judg 9:54*).\n\n
31:8	idm35912					 The victorious army would **strip the dead** to search for anything valuable (such as clothing, weapons, or jewelry) on the corpses.\n\n
31:9	idm35919					 In the ancient world, the death of an enemy king was **good news***,* for it meant that the enemy’s god had been defeated. However, little did the Philistines know that their victory would be short-lived and hollow. David, the Lord’s true anointed king, would soon come to power and pay back the Philistines mightily. Far from defeating Israel’s God, the Philistines were simply fulfilling his purpose.\n\n
31:10	idm35927					 **the Ashtoreths:** See *7:3*. • **fastened his body:** This practice further degraded the executed person by depriving him of proper burial. It also served as a deterrent to other potential enemies (see also *Gen 40:19*; *Deut 21:21-22*; *Josh 10:26*; *Esth 9:6-14*). • **Beth-shan** was a short distance east of Mount Gilboa.\n\n
31:11	idm35941					 The **people of Jabesh-gilead** were returning the favor Saul had done for them when he saved them from the Ammonites and their king Nahash (*11:1-13*). Jabesh-gilead was about twelve miles southeast of Beth-shan and across the Jordan River.\n\n
31:12	idm35949					 **burned the bodies:** Cremation was rare. It is possible the bodies were burned because decomposition had already set in.\n\n
31:13	idm35956					 **bones . . . Jabesh:** This was not the final resting place of Saul’s remains (see *2 Sam 21:12-14*). • The ending of 1 Samuel brings Israel’s history back to the situation at the end of Judges, when “Israel had no king.” Once again, the Philistines were in control. David had God’s anointing but no crown. He had wives but no sons. His affiliation with the hated Philistines might jeopardize his standing among his own people. David’s future path would be challenging, but God was clearly with him.\n\n
