1:1	idm31060					 **The judges ruled** from the death of Joshua (about 1376 or 1200 BC) to the beginning of Saul’s reign as king (about 1050 BC). The events in Ruth occurred around 1100 BC. • **Famine** in Israel’s hill country was usually caused by drought. • **Bethlehem** was a small town in the hill country of northern **Judah**. • **Moab,** the land southeast of Judah, sometimes received sufficient rain when Judah did not.\n\n
1:2	idm31074					 **Ephrathites** were from the clan of Ephrathah, centered in Bethlehem of Judah (see *Gen 35:19*; *1 Chr 4:4*).\n\n
1:4	idm31083					 Kilion **married . . . Orpah**; Mahlon married **Ruth** (see *4:10*).\n\n
1:5	idm31092					 **This left Naomi alone** (literally *the woman was bereft*): Naomi suffered devastating emotional losses. She was also without economic support, and with the loss of heirs, she had no hope for the future of her family.\n\n
1:6	idm31100					 **giving:** This same Hebrew verb is used in *4:13* (“enabled”). These two notices of God’s acts enclose the story between similar phrases (an *inclusio,* literary “bookends”). God gives good things, such as food and children, and he works providentially behind the scenes in the ordinary course of things.\n\n
1:8	idm31109					 **But on the way:** They had probably gone only a short distance when Naomi released Ruth and Orpah to return to their **mothers’ homes**.\n\n
1:9	idm31117					 Naomi here speaks the first of the book’s several blessings.\n\n
1:14	idm31123					 **Ruth clung tightly to Naomi:** The Hebrew verb used here emphasizes the strength of Ruth’s love for her mother-in-law; it is the same word used to describe a man being “joined to” his wife (*Gen 2:24*) and to describe a person staying faithful to the Lord (*Deut 4:4*; *10:20*; *Josh 22:5*).\n\n
1:15	idm31134					 **to her gods:** Every nation believed in its own territorial god. Naomi assumed that Ruth would continue to worship Moabite gods.\n\n
1:16	idm31141					 **Ruth** swore an oath in the name of **the** Lord to seal her firm commitment to Israel’s God (cp. *2:11-12*) and to Naomi.\n\n
1:20	idm31151					 **Almighty** translates the Hebrew word *shadday*, which pictures God’s strength and provision. Naomi’s complaint was real, but God provided exactly what she needed (see *4:14-17*).\n\n
1:22	idm31160					 **The beginning of the barley harvest** was between late March and mid-April by our calendar.\n\n
2:1	idm31167					 **Boaz** was **a relative of . . . Elimelech** and thus was qualified to be a family redeemer for the two widows, Ruth and Naomi (see *study note on 2:20*).\n\n
2:2	idm31176					 **to pick up the stalks of grain left behind:** Harvesters were to leave some grain for the poor to glean (see *Lev 19:9-10*; *23:22*; *Deut 24:19-22*). God provided the poor with food.\n\n
2:3	idm31186					 **as it happened, she found herself:** Ruth seemingly selected at random the field in which she would glean; God works through ordinary choices to provide for those who trust him.\n\n
2:5	idm31193					 **Boaz** recognized Ruth as a marriageable **young woman** (Hebrew *na‘arah*).\n\n
2:7	idm31202					 **in the shelter:** Many farmers in Israel’s hill country erected shelters beside their fields for use during the harvest. Workers used these shelters for shade during lunch or other break times during the long, hard workday. Such shelters can still be seen in parts of the hill country.\n\n
2:8	idm31209					 **Boaz** gave **Ruth** the special privilege of gleaning **right behind the young women**. After the men cut the grain and tied it in small bundles, the women gathered the bundles into larger sheaves. The Torah did not require farmers to allow gleaners into the fields until the sheaves had been taken to the threshing floor. • **I have warned the young men not to treat you roughly:** Boaz assured Ruth that no one under his authority would taunt her or try to drive her away from his fields even though she was present before the proper time for gleaners to come in. • **help yourself to the water:** Boaz’s generosity saved Ruth the trouble of drawing her own water.\n\n
2:13	idm31220					 **your workers** (literally *your maidservants*): By her use of this term, Ruth placed herself lower on the social scale than Boaz’s servants.\n\n
2:14	idm31228					 By sharing his meal with Ruth, **Boaz** extended hospitality far beyond the call of duty.\n\n
2:15	idm31235					 Boaz’s instructions to his reapers as they returned to work after lunch made Ruth’s gleaning a great deal more productive. Boaz provided for Ruth much more than the law of gleaning required of him.\n\n
2:18	idm31241					 In giving Naomi **the roasted grain that was left over**, Ruth was conscientious and generous.\n\n
2:19	idm31248					 **all this grain:** Ruth could not normally have gleaned nearly as much as an ephah of barley (about two-thirds of a bushel).\n\n
2:20	idm31255					 **family redeemers** (Hebrew *go’el*): The law specified that the *go’el*, the nearest male kinsman, was to help a relative who fell into economic difficulty (see “*The Family Redeemer*” Theme Note; see also *study note on Lev 25:25*).\n\n
2:21	idm31266					 The author refers to **Ruth** as (literally) “Ruth the Moabite” five times (*1:22*; *2:2*, *21*; *4:5*, *10*), reminding us repeatedly that Ruth was not an Israelite.\n\n
3:1	idm31278					 **a permanent home** (literally *a resting place*): Naomi used a related word in *1:9* when she prayed for Ruth and Orpah. Now she suggested a course of action that might encourage Boaz to act on Ruth’s behalf.\n\n
3:2	idm31287					 As a **close relative**, Boaz might act as a redeemer for Ruth and Naomi (see study notes on *2:20*; *3:9*). • The **threshing floor** was a flat surface of stone or hardened earth. The farmer spread sheaves of grain over its surface and beat them to separate the grain from the straw. Then the farmer would begin **winnowing** by throwing the mixed straw and grain into the air with a wooden fork or shovel. The breeze carried the lighter straw and chaff downwind, while the heavier grains fell to the threshing floor.\n\n
3:3	idm31298					 **take a bath** (literally *wash yourself*): Ruth probably bathed herself with a cloth dipped in water (only the wealthy had facilities for immersing themselves). Bathing was not an everyday expectation; this was a special occasion.\n\n
3:4	idm31306					 Ruth was to **uncover** Boaz’s **feet** to ensure that he would waken.\n\n
3:7	idm31314					 **he lay down:** The owner slept at the threshing floor to deter petty theft.\n\n
3:8	idm31321					 **He was surprised** (literally *He was terrified*): Boaz knew that a woman lay **at his feet**, but he did not know who she was or why she was there.\n\n
3:9	idm31330					 **your servant:** Ruth deliberately identified herself with the female workers. • **Spread . . . your covering over me:** This was a way of asking Boaz to marry her (cp. *Ezek 16:8*). • Ruth appealed to Boaz’s status as a **family redeemer** (Hebrew *go’el*) to persuade him to marry her (see *Ruth 4:5*; “*The Family Redeemer*” Theme Note).\n\n
3:10	idm31343					 **You are showing even more family loyalty:** Ruth was not obligated to come to Bethlehem with Naomi, nor did she have to marry within Elimelech’s family or provide them with an heir to the land (see *4:5*).\n\n
3:11	idm31351					 **what is necessary** (literally *what you are asking*): Boaz agreed to act on Ruth’s behalf. Some interpreters understand Boaz’s statement as an unconditional agreement to marry Ruth (see also *study note on 4:5*); most take it to mean that Boaz would act to provide for Ruth and Naomi by presenting to the nearer kinsman the opportunity to act as family redeemer before taking the opportunity himself (*4:1-12*). By voluntarily taking on the role of the family redeemer for Ruth and Naomi, Boaz became a forerunner of Jesus.\n\n
3:12	idm31361					 **Another man** was **more closely related** to Elimelech than Boaz. He had the first right of refusal to act as family redeemer and (according to most interpreters) to marry Ruth.\n\n
3:15	idm31369					 **six scoops:** There were two scoop sizes. The smaller measure (the *omer*) was 1/10 of an ephah (about 2 quarts); the larger measure (the *seah*) was 1/3 of an ephah (about 6 2/3 quarts). The latter quantity is more likely and indicates a very generous gift, twice the amount that Ruth gleaned on her first day (*2:17*); it was a significant token of good faith.\n\n
4:1	idm31385					 Most legal transactions, including property transfers, were carried out at **the town gate**. • **friend:** Boaz might or might not have used the man’s name, but the author of Ruth avoided doing so.\n\n
4:3	idm31393					 **Naomi . . . is selling the land:** Naomi probably did not have control of Elimelech’s ancestral land, though she did have legal title. She was selling the right to redeem it, or buy it back, from whoever was currently using it.\n\n
4:4	idm31400					 **redeem it:** The law called for a near relative, the family redeemer, to buy land when a landowner had to sell it (see *Lev 25:23-34*). This practice kept land in the family; the redeemer was a conservator for the land until the destitute landowner could recover economically and buy it back. • **All right, I’ll redeem it:** The kinsman could see a great opportunity—there was no male heir and no apparent likelihood that there would be one, so he could add the land to his own estate while doing his social duty for the family.\n\n
4:5	idm31409					 **your purchase . . . requires that you marry Ruth** (literally *on the day you purchase . . . you acquire Ruth*): In the Hebrew manuscripts that we have, the body of this verse reads *I acquire,* but a scribal correction in the margin reads *you acquire,* a difference of one letter. (The scribe believed *you acquire* was the original reading and that the body of the text contained an error.) Some interpreters believe the body of the Hebrew text (*I acquire*) is the original reading of the text, indicating that the marriage between Boaz and Ruth was already set to occur (see *study note on 3:11*). Most translators, however, believe that the marginal correction (*you acquire*) represents the original reading of the text because: (1) The scribe who made the marginal correction believed that *you acquire* was the original reading; (2) most ancient translations of Ruth, which predate our oldest copies of the Hebrew text, also read *you acquire*; and (3) it is easy to envision that an earlier Hebrew scribe (working before our earliest manuscript copies) substituted *I acquire*—as it appears in *4:10*—in place of *you acquire*. • **That way she can have children who will carry on her husband’s name and keep the land in the family:** This sentence draws heavily on *Deut 25:7*. Boaz connected the duties of a family redeemer (see study notes on *Ruth 2:20*; *Lev 25:25*) with the duties of a brother-in-law (Latin *levir*) to provide an heir for a deceased brother (see *Deut 25:5-10* for a description of *levirate marriage;* cp. *Gen 38*). There is no precise precedent for Boaz’s legal maneuver. The duty of the *levir* as stated in *Deut 25:5-10* was not binding in this situation (neither Boaz nor the other kinsman was Elimelech’s brother, and Ruth was not Elimelech’s widow). Boaz was apparently using the spirit of the law concerning the *go’el* (family redeemer) to establish a moral, if not a legal, obligation to serve as *levir* and provide the deceased with an heir to inherit the land (see *study note on Lev 25:25*). The concepts of land ownership and provision for an heir were intimately connected in ancient Israel (cp. *Num 27:1-11*). Because Naomi was beyond childbearing age, Ruth, the widow of Elimelech’s son, would be the mother for such an heir. This maneuver apparently surprised the other kinsman (*Ruth 4:6*), but it is clear from what follows that Boaz’s argument, while perhaps novel, was accepted as valid.\n\n
4:6	idm31443					 **Then I can’t redeem it:** The addition of Ruth to the transaction completely changed the equation for the other kinsman. • **this might endanger my own estate:** If he bought the land, married Ruth, and raised an heir for Elimelech, he might invest many resources only to lose control of the new land, and he might not have enough to maintain his own land. If he then failed to have a second son with Ruth as his own heir, his land would be inherited by Elimelech’s heir, and his own name would die out. Even if this kinsman had acquired the land and not Ruth (see study notes on *3:11*; *4:5*), he still might lose his investment in the land to the heir born to Ruth. By acting to preserve his own name, this man became the no-name who refused to help his close relative.\n\n
4:7	idm31453					 **in those days:** The book of Ruth was not written immediately after these events. By the time Ruth was written, most people had forgotten this custom of removing a **sandal** and what it meant. The transfer of a sandal symbolized **transferring a right of purchase** to redeem the land. See also *Deut 25:9* for a similar (but not identical) custom in relation to levirate marriage; in both cases, the sandal apparently signified the right of redemption.\n\n
4:10	idm31463					 **And with the land** (literally *And besides*): Boaz intended to raise an heir for **Mahlon**, the first son, who would **carry on the family name of her dead husband** and inherit his land.\n\n
4:11	idm31473					 **Rachel and Leah**, Jacob’s two wives, were the mothers of Israel. • **Ephrathah:** See *study note on 1:2*.\n\n
4:12	idm31482					 Like Ruth, **Tamar** had been a foreigner; she became the mother of **Perez** and Zerah, through whom Judah’s descendants came.\n\n
4:13	idm31490					 **the** Lord** enabled:** See *study note on 1:6*.\n\n
4:14	idm31500					 This child replaced the family **Naomi** had lost when her own two sons died in Moab. **The women of the town** recognized that **this child** completed the circle of redemption for Naomi.\n\n
4:15	idm31509					 **care for you in your old age** (literally *cause your old age to be full*): With the birth of Obed, Naomi’s life was full again (cp. *1:21*).\n\n
4:18	idm31518					 The book of Ruth ends with a genealogy of ten generations, from Perez, the son of Judah (Jacob’s son), to David, the grandson of Obed. Besides being one of the world’s great stories, this tale concerns the family history of David, Israel’s greatest king. That Ruth and Boaz were ancestors of Israel’s greatest king is a major reason for the inclusion of this small book in the Old Testament.\n\n
