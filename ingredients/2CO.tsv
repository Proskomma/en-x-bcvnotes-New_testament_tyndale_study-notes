1:1	idm152002					 Letters in the first century usually began by mentioning the writer’s name and that of the person(s) addressed, followed by a greeting (see *Acts 15:23*; *23:25-26*). Paul follows this pattern. • Paul highlights his calling as an **apostle***;* his status as God’s appointed agent for establishing the church had been challenged at Corinth.\n\n
1:2	idm152012					 Paul turns the usual, colorless “greetings” (Greek chairein) into a rich salutation by praying for God’s **grace** (Greek charis) **and peace** on his readers.\n\n
1:3	idm152022					 Paul now breaks into a jubilant thanksgiving. He is glad that, in spite of many troubles that have weighed upon him, he has had special **comfort** from God (*1:4-7*) and has been rescued from death in the province of Asia (*1:8-11*).\n\n
1:3	idm152031					 **our merciful Father:** God delights in showing favor to his people and in hearing his children’s cry (*Ps 145:18-19*).\n\n
1:4	idm152039					 One purpose of suffering is to qualify Christ’s servants to enter sympathetically into the experience of others. Paul is not an aloof pastor, remote from the people to whom he ministers.\n\n
1:6	idm152045					 **it is for your comfort and salvation!** Paul’s sharing in their troubles and offering of encouragement promotes their spiritual well-being.\n\n
1:8	idm152052					 **dear brothers and sisters:** Greek adelphoi. This traditional term of affection is used to address members of the same family, both male and female. • **The trouble we went through in the province of Asia** is not easy to identify. One suggestion is the riot in Ephesus (*Acts 19:23-41*). Another is that Paul was tried in a civil court and faced the prospect of execution in Ephesus (*2 Cor 1:9*; see *1 Cor 15:32*). Less likely is that he suffered an acute life-threatening illness. Paul was no stranger to **mortal danger** (*2 Cor 1:10*; see also *4:10-12*; *6:9*; *11:23*), but he was marvelously rescued by divine assistance (*1:11*).\n\n
1:12	idm152070					 Paul’s travel plans and his unfulfilled promise of a visit to Corinth were criticized; he was charged with being fickle like persons of the world “who say ‘Yes’ when they really mean ‘No’” (*1:17*). Before responding to that charge, he clarifies his motives in his ministry and in his letters.\n\n
1:12	idm152077					 **holiness:** Some manuscripts read *honesty.* The difference is only two letters in Greek (hagiotēti*,* “holiness”; haplotēti*,* “honesty”).\n\n
1:15	idm152089					 Paul had **changed** his travel **plan**. In *1 Cor 16:5*, he expressed the hope of visiting Corinth after passing through **Macedonia**. Then he evidently promised to visit Corinth earlier (perhaps in his “severe letter,” *2 Cor 7:8*)—on his way north. Now he would have to go back to the original plan, and that earlier visit, bringing **a double blessing**, would not be happening after all.\n\n
1:17	idm152101					 Paul’s apparent indecisiveness and failure to keep his promise were being criticized. Paul’s protest is indignant.\n\n
1:18	idm152107					 It was bad enough that Paul’s enemies at Corinth had attacked his character as unreliable and shifty (*1:17*). It was worse when they charged that his entire message was just as uncertain. In these verses Paul answers that allegation.\n\n
1:18	idm152114					 **As surely as God is faithful:** God can be trusted, as can his promises in Christ and his ministry through the apostles.\n\n
1:19	idm152121					 **Silas** was a well-known Christian leader from the church in Antioch (see *Acts 15:22*, *27*, *32*; *1 Thes 1:1*; *2 Thes 1:1*; *1 Pet 5:12*).\n\n
1:20	idm152134					 God has put a seal of approval, **with a resounding “Yes!”** on the Old Testament prophecies as they are fulfilled in Christ. Believers respond with **“Amen,”** meaning “confirmed and agreed.”\n\n
1:21	idm152142					 Paul’s ministry was enabled, **commissioned** (literally *anointed*), and endorsed by God, who equipped him for his work. • **along with you:** All believers are **identified . . . as his own** (literally *sealed*) by the Holy Spirit, who is God’s gift to his people (see *Rom 8:1-27*; *Gal 3:2-7*; *5:5-6*, *16-26*; *Eph 1:13-14*). • **First installment** is a commercial term for a deposit or down payment, guaranteeing full possession (see *2 Cor 5:5*; *Eph 1:14*).\n\n
1:23	idm152161					 **God as my witness:** This mild oath indicates that he is telling the truth (see *1 Sam 12:5*; *20:12*; *Job 16:19*; cp. *Ruth 1:17*; *1 Sam 14:44*; *2 Sam 3:35*; *1 Kgs 2:23*; *Jer 42:5*). The real reason for Paul’s change of travel plans was **to spare** them **from a severe rebuke** (*2 Cor 1:23*) and not inflict **another painful visit** on them (*2:1*).\n\n
2:1	idm152181					 Paul’s previous **visit** had been very **painful** and had caused him great distress. This visit is not recorded in Acts; it apparently took place during Paul’s three-year ministry in Ephesus (see *Acts 19:8-22*). During that visit, Paul severely rebuked the church (*2 Cor 1:23*) and was insulted by an unnamed man (*2:5-11*).\n\n
2:3	idm152192					 After his painful visit (*2:1*), Paul then wrote a letter with **great anguish . . . and many tears** that was intended for the Corinthians’ good. That letter (see also *7:8-10*) has evidently been lost. But it was effective in bringing about the needed repentance and change.\n\n
2:5	idm152201					 These verses are the outcome of Paul’s earlier visit and the insult he received. Following Paul’s severe but tearful letter, the church condemned the behavior of **the man who caused all the trouble** and disciplined him (*2:6*). He repented, so now it was **time to forgive and comfort him***,* as Paul had already done.\n\n
2:11	idm152211					 If we exercise forgiveness, as Paul did, **Satan will not outsmart us** by making us either too lax over sin or too rigorous in punishing offenders. • **familiar with his evil schemes:** Cp. *11:3*, *14*; *Eph 6:11*.\n\n
2:12	idm152222					 After the riot at Ephesus (*Acts 19:1–20:1*), Paul went to the seaport of **Troas** (*Acts 20:5*). He was impatient to get news from **Titus** about the result of the severe but tearful letter (*2 Cor 2:4*), and he crossed over to Macedonia in northern Greece **to find him**.\n\n
2:14	idm152234					 At this point, the story about finding Titus breaks off and will not be resumed until *7:5*. Paul digresses to discuss his ministry as an apostle proclaiming the Good News.\n\n
2:14	idm152241					 Like **captives** in a Roman general’s celebration march, Paul was **in Christ’s triumphal procession** (cp. *1 Cor 4:9*; *Eph 4:7-11*), carrying the marks of willing servitude (see *Rom 1:1*; *Gal 6:17*).\n\n
2:15	idm152253					 Incense was scattered along the parade route of a victorious Roman general, and it was received in one of two ways. For the captives, who were on their way to the arena and death, it was **a dreadful smell of death and doom**. For the victors, it was **a life-giving perfume**. So it is with the lives of those who proclaim the Good News, which either leads to eternal life or seals the fate of the person who rejects it (cp. *1 Cor 1:18*).\n\n
2:17	idm152262					 Paul contrasts his service with that of his opponents. • They **preach for personal profit** and adulterate the truth, like merchants in Paul’s day who offered shoddy goods, or innkeepers who watered down the wine. By contrast, Paul preached **with sincerity and with Christ’s authority** (cp. *1:12*; *4:2*). Paul’s denial of mercenary motives reemerges in *11:1–12:21*.\n\n
3:1	idm152273					 Paul’s ministry was validated by the lives of those who were changed by the Good News rather than by a **letter of recommendation** (cp. *Acts 18:27*). Christ, the author of this transformation, used Paul to lead believers to him. The marks of genuineness are not in letters **written** . . . **with pen and ink** on parchment, but in the fruit of **the Spirit** (*Gal 5:22-23*) in human lives and **carved** . . . **on human hearts**.\n\n
3:4	idm152287					 The contrast between Paul’s ministry and the others’ ministries leads Paul to contrast the **old covenant** of written laws (*Exod 31:18*) with the **new covenant** written on human hearts (*Jer 31:33*).\n\n
3:4	idm152297					 **The old written covenant** is the Mosaic law as interpreted by the Jewish rabbis. It **ends in death** for adherents who see it as a way of salvation. The law is good (*Rom 7:12-14*), but those who use it to gain merit fail. It leads either to transgression or to pride; either way, the law brings condemnation (*2 Cor 3:9*).\n\n
3:7	idm152307					 The old covenant had its moments of **glory***,* such as when **Moses’ face** . . . **shone** from his communion with the Lord (*Exod 34:29-35*). • The **old way** has been **replaced** by **the new way***,* which is eternal (*Heb 8:8-13*).\n\n
3:12	idm152323					 The old covenant, represented by Moses’ **veil***,* led to fear and did not remove spiritual blindness.\n\n
3:16	idm152331					 The believer who **turns to the Lord** has freedom in the **Spirit**. We receive something Moses never knew as we become **more and more like** Christ (*4:4*; *John 1:1-14*; *Col 1:15*; *Heb 1:1-4*) **and reflect the glory of the Lord**. Divine glory in this present life leads to our being like Christ in the next life (*Rom 8:29*; *Gal 4:19*; *Phil 3:21*; *1 Jn 3:2*).\n\n
4:1	idm152349					 **This new way** (or *This new ministry*) shows us God’s **mercy**. Paul felt privileged to have the ministry of sharing the message of good news (*1 Cor 15:9-11*; *1 Tim 1:12-17*).\n\n
4:2	idm152360					 Paul’s ministry was marked by honesty, unlike some other preachers (*2:17*).\n\n
4:3	idm152367					 The **Good News** divides people into two categories: those who remain in darkness and those who are enlightened by God (see *Acts 26:18*, cp. *John 3:19-21*). God’s action in bringing people to himself is a movement from a realm governed by darkness to the light of God’s presence (*Col 1:12-14*; *1 Pet 2:9*). **The god of this world** fights against the change that the Good News brings to people’s hearts and **minds**.\n\n
4:5	idm152380					 **We preach that Jesus Christ is Lord:** See also *Rom 10:9-10*; *1 Cor 12:3*; *Col 2:6*.\n\n
4:7	idm152390					 The message of good news is like **great treasure***,* but it is housed in **fragile clay jars***—*our weak bodies. This insight gives purpose to suffering (*4:8–5:10*).\n\n
4:11	idm152401					 Believers often share the humiliation of the Lord with confidence that they will also share in his triumphant risen life (*4:14*).\n\n
4:12	idm152408					 Through his life of danger and exposure to mortal peril (see *1 Cor 15:30*), Paul was reinforcing the faith of the Christians in the churches that he founded (cp. *Col 1:24*; *2 Tim 2:10*).\n\n
4:13	idm152417					 The secret of Paul’s resilience was in **the same kind of faith the psalmist had***,* (see *Ps 116:10*), which is centered in the living Lord.\n\n
4:16	idm152426					 **we never give up:** This call to endurance is given with a reminder of what is in store in the future (*5:1-10*). The human body is in the process of **dying** in the normal course of growing old, and Paul was particularly worn away physically and emotionally (*4:8-12*). Yet he was **being renewed every day**—his spirit’s life was being rejuvenated and revitalized by the power of God.\n\n
4:18	idm152437					 If we **look at the troubles we can see now***,* we grow faint; but when we see our lives in the light of eternal reality, we know that our troubles **will soon be gone**.\n\n
5:1	idm152446					 The prospect of eternal hope is bright, with **heavenly bodies** replacing the **dying bodies** of this present life. The God of resurrection will also raise us and present us to himself with all believers (*4:14*). The immediate stimulus for this statement of resurrection hope was what Paul had to face in Ephesus (*1:8-11*). The frailty of his body reminded him of what lies beyond death, when **this earthly tent we live in***—*that is, our body—will be taken down in death and dissolution (see *1 Cor 15:42-57*; *Phil 3:20-21*).\n\n
5:2	idm152460					 **we long to put on our heavenly bodies:** This is no death wish; Paul was yearning for the Lord’s return when he would give new bodies to his people (*1 Cor 15:51-58*; *Phil 3:20-21*; *1 Thes 4:16-17*).\n\n
5:7	idm152470					 Our hope for future resurrection can only be known by faith (see *Heb 11:1*, *3*, *27*), yet we do have Jesus’ own resurrection and the presence of the Holy Spirit as evidence of what is to come (*1 Cor 15:1-9*; *Eph 1:14*).\n\n
5:9	idm152481					 The **goal** of the present life is **to please him** (see also *Rom 12:1-2*; *14:18*; *Col 1:10*; *1 Thes 4:1*). This ambition will be tested when we **stand before Christ to be judged**. The judge is also our advocate, so we are confident of acquittal (*Rom 8:1*, *33-34*). Yet actions **done in this earthly body** will be assessed and called to account (*Acts 17:31*).\n\n
5:11	idm152498					 Paul now explains the main theme of his message, which is reconciliation—the turning of enemies into friends and the restoration of relationships. Paul’s thinking is rooted in what God has done through Christ to reconcile sinners to himself (*5:18-21*). This exposition is framed by a defense of his own ministry (*5:11-17*) and an application of his message to the situation in Corinth (*6:1–7:4*).\n\n
5:11	idm152507					 One motive for Paul’s ministry is **fearful responsibility to the Lord**—not a cringing dread, but a healthy reverence (see *Prov 1:7*).\n\n
5:12	idm152515					 Paul’s opponents bragged **about having a spectacular ministry** outwardly, but they did not have **a sincere heart** (cp. *1 Sam 16:7*; *Rom 2:28-29*).\n\n
5:13	idm152525					 **If . . . we are crazy:** This statement might imply a charge on Paul’s previous visit to Corinth (*2:1-2*) that he was out of his mind when he proclaimed the simple Good News there (*1 Cor 2:2*).\n\n
5:14	idm152534					 Paul’s doctrine of reconciliation arises from his conviction that (1) Christ **died for** all believers; (2) in Christ, believers also die to sin and self; and (3) now all believers should **live for Christ**. The new life in Christ thus leads to a fresh evaluation of other people and of Christ.\n\n
5:14	idm152542					 **Christ’s love controls us:** This could refer either to believers’ love for Christ or (more likely) to Christ’s love for us, which urges believers on in making Christ known through their service (see *1 Cor 9:16*).\n\n
5:16	idm152550					 **merely from a human point of view:** Paul might be reflecting on his belief** at one time** as a Pharisee that the Messiah would come to set the Jews free from political oppression. • **How differently we know him now!** Christ rose from the dead, ushered in the **new** creation (*5:17*), and was established as the redeemer from sin and Lord of the universe (*Rom 1:3-4*; *Phil 2:6-11*; *Col 1:15-20*).\n\n
5:18	idm152564					 God entrusts to his servants the **message** and ministry of reconciliation **through Christ**. • **God has given us this task of reconciling people:** Paul is speaking of his own ministry, but sharing **this wonderful message** is the responsibility of all believers. **Christ’s ambassadors** call people to accept what God has done so they can be **made right with God through Christ**. • Christ paid the penalty for **people’s sins**—to take away all that stood between God and humans and to make us right with God.\n\n
5:20	idm152577					 The great privilege of believers is to be **Christ’s ambassadors** (cp. *Eph 6:20*). • **God is making his appeal through us:** Paul doesn’t say that he speaks for God; rather, God speaks his word through us. • Christ’s redeeming work for sinners opens the way for them to **“Come back to God!”** and be reconciled with him (see *Rom 5:1-11*; *Eph 2:11-22*; *Col 1:15-23*). Christian witness has this appeal at its heart. Paul was also appealing to the rebellious Corinthians to come over to his side (see *2 Cor 6:1*).\n\n
5:21	idm152591					 **Christ** became **the offering for our sin** on the cross when he took sin’s penalty on himself and died a criminal’s death. He did this, though he himself **never sinned** (*John 8:46*; *1 Pet 2:22*; *1 Jn 3:5*), so that we might be **made right with God**—i.e., set in right relationship with God and accepted by him (see *Gal 3:13*).\n\n
6:1	idm152605					 To win over the disaffected believers at Corinth, Paul appeals to them to listen to him and Timothy as God’s servants and messengers. • **As God’s partners:** Literally *As we work together,* which leaves open the question whether Paul meant that they were working together in a team effort, or that they were working together with God.\n\n
6:2	idm152613					 This quotation from *Isa 49:8* clinches the point that God’s offer of **salvation** could secure reconciliation between Paul and the Corinthians; their reconciliation with Paul would follow naturally from their true acceptance of the Good News.\n\n
6:3	idm152621					 Paul gives a revealing picture of the hardships of his ministry (cp. *4:7-18*). Nine trials are listed; many of these experiences from Paul’s life are recorded in Acts (e.g., *Acts 14:5-6*, *19-20*; *16:19-24*; *21:30-36*). Through their steadfast suffering for the Good News, Paul and Timothy (*2 Cor 1:1*) showed that they were **true ministers of God**.\n\n
6:6	idm152634					 Paul describes the spirit with which he faced suffering, attributing his strength to the presence of **the Holy Spirit within us**.\n\n
6:8	idm152641					 Paul’s character as an apostle was often attacked; he and his colleagues were even called **imposters**. Yet he was **honest** in spite of people’s attitudes. They must have thought that Paul was a nobody who could be safely **ignored***,* a foolhardy person who ran unnecessary risks that made him as good as dead already. Paul rebuts each of their allegations with insight into spiritual reality.\n\n
6:11	idm152651					 Paul’s impassioned plea reveals his inner feelings. • **our hearts are open to you . . . Open your hearts to us!** These sentiments are continued in *7:2* (see study notes on *6:14–7:1*; *7:2-4*).\n\n
6:14	idm152661					 The connection between *6:13* and *7:2* has led many scholars to conclude that *6:14–7:1* is an inserted fragment from another letter (perhaps the one mentioned in *1 Cor 5:9*). However, this section might just as well be a digression in Paul’s writing, a suitable challenge to the Corinthians to forsake their opposition to Paul and his message. Paul was anxious to see relationships restored; here, Paul draws a picture of believers in Christ forming a holy temple. Believers’ identity as the temple of God motivates the need for harmony among them as well as separation from the impurity of unbelieving attitudes and behaviors. Paul therefore draws the contrast between Christian and pagan morality with quotations from the Old Testament.\n\n
6:14	idm152671					 **Don’t team up with those who are unbelievers:** This instruction alludes to the Jewish prohibition of certain mixtures (*Lev 19:19*; *Deut 22:10*). Paul was probably referring to how the Corinthians had been involving themselves in idolatrous practices (see *1 Cor 8–10*; cp. *1 Cor 10:14-22*).\n\n
6:15	idm152682					 **the devil:** Greek Beliar. This Hebrew word means “worthless, good-for-nothing”; in the intertestamental period it came to be used as a name for Satan.\n\n
6:16	idm152690					 Believers together **are the temple of the living God***,* indwelt by the Holy Spirit and thus holy (*1 Cor 3:16*; *1 Pet 2:1-10*).\n\n
6:18	idm152700					 This quotation is from *2 Sam 7:14*, though Paul adds **and daughters** (cp. *Isa 43:6*).\n\n
7:1	idm152709					 Paul wanted the church to be a holy people, filled with God’s presence. • **because we fear God:** We should be reverent in the presence of a holy God (see *study note on 5:11*).\n\n
7:2	idm152717					 **Please open your hearts to us:** Paul picks up his plea from *6:11-13* (see *study note on 6:14–7:1*). Paul had a deep concern for the churches (*11:28*), expressed by seeking a close bond of fellowship. When he was misunderstood, he explained his actions, as he does here. • **We have not . . . taken advantage of anyone:** That is, by taking their money.\n\n
7:4	idm152728					 **All our troubles** might refer to Paul’s many hardships (*6:5*) or his problems with the Corinthians themselves. Either way, he was filled with joy because the church’s response had **greatly encouraged** him (as he explains in *7:5-16*).\n\n
7:5	idm152738					 Paul’s joy leads him to tell about his recent meeting with **Titus***,* whose **presence was a joy** when he joined Paul in Macedonia (see *study note on 2:14–7:4*; *Acts 20:1-2*). • Initially, Paul had no **rest** (this Greek word is used in *2 Cor 2:13*, where it is rendered “peace of mind”) but only **conflict***,*** battles***,* and **fear**. Paul was deeply discouraged, but he received encouragement from **God, who encourages those who are discouraged** (cp. *Ps 42:5-6*). Titus arrived from Corinth with the news that Paul’s letter (see *2 Cor 2:3-4*) had done its work (*7:8-16*). This was the chief cause of Paul’s **joy**.\n\n
7:8	idm152761					 Paul **was sorry at first** that he had sent his previous letter (see *2:3-4*). Now he was **not sorry***,* realizing that the **pain** had been worthwhile, for the severe letter had brought the church in Corinth to **repentance**. They had rebuked the offending person—perhaps too strongly (see *2:6-11*).\n\n
7:9	idm152774					 Two kinds of sorrow are mentioned: (1) **Worldly sorrow** that **lacks repentance** leads to **spiritual death** (e.g., see *Matt 27:3-6*; *Heb 12:16-17*). (2) Sorrow that **leads us away from sin** leads to **salvation***,* as it did when the church in Corinth responded positively to Paul’s rebuke.\n\n
7:13	idm152788					 The way the Corinthians had welcomed and obeyed **Titus** as Paul’s agent endeared the Corinthians to Titus and **delighted** Paul. The crisis at Corinth was over, and Paul had **complete confidence** that all was well.\n\n
7:14	idm152797					 All along Paul had been optimistic, despite his fears, about the outcome of Titus’s trip to Corinth.\n\n
8:1	idm152803					 Paul now turns his attention to the collection for the Jerusalem church (*8:4*; *9:1*). This relief fund was intended to aid the poverty-stricken saints in the holy city (*Acts 11:27-30*; *Rom 15:25-27*, *31*; *Gal 2:10*). Paul had earlier given instructions about this matter (*1 Cor 16:1-2*); now it was time to collect the funds (*2 Cor 8:6*). Paul hoped this gift from Gentile congregations to the Jewish church would cement relations between the two groups in the early Christian community.\n\n
8:1	idm152817					 **The churches in Macedonia** included the church in Philippi, which we know from Acts and Philippians was **being tested by many troubles** and was **very poor**. Yet they were generous in sending gifts to Paul and in supporting the collection (*8:4-5*; *Phil 1:5*; *2:25-30*; *4:15-20*).\n\n
8:6	idm152830					 **Titus** would start taking up the collection when he returned to Corinth carrying this letter from Paul in Macedonia.\n\n
8:7	idm152837					 This is the key verse in Paul’s exposition on Christian giving (*8:1–9:15*). The Corinthians had a reputation for spiritual gifts (*1 Cor 1:5-7*; *14:12*). Now, they must be leaders **in this gracious act of giving***,* which is a hallmark of true spirituality (cp. *1 Cor 13:1-13*). God had been lavish in his goodness to the Corinthians, so they should be generous to the Jewish believers in their need (*2 Cor 9:13*). This would be recognized as a sign of unity in Christ.\n\n
8:9	idm152850					 The model for generous giving is the **Lord** himself, who **was rich** in the Father’s presence (*John 17:5*, *24*) yet **became poor** by accepting a human existence and death on the cross (see *Phil 2:6-11*). By that self-giving sacrifice, **he could make** people **rich** with the blessings of salvation.\n\n
8:10	idm152864					 **What you started a year ago** was the collection of an offering for Jerusalem, prompted by *1 Cor 16:1-2*. So this letter is to be dated at least one year after 1 Corinthians.\n\n
8:15	idm152872					 Paul quotes from *Exod 16:18* to say that there is a mutual responsibility among Christians: Affluent believers (the Corinthians) should help poor believers (in Jerusalem) so that all may have enough.\n\n
8:18	idm152879					 Two other Christian men would travel with **Titus** to Corinth in order **to guard against any criticism** over the handling of the relief funds that they collected (*8:20-21*). Titus and his companions would ensure that the money was properly handled. The identity of the two companions is unknown.\n\n
8:23	idm152888					 **they bring honor to Christ:** Paul’s last phrase is even more expressive in Greek (literally *they are* *the glory of Christ*)—they are examples of Christians who reflect the Lord’s splendor (*3:1-18*).\n\n
9:1	idm152898					 Two motives reinforce the spirit of love in giving: (1) to emulate the Macedonians, who in their poverty had been forthcoming in their generosity (*9:2*); and (2) not to shame Paul or themselves, since he had boasted about the Corinthians’ generosity to the Macedonians (*9:3-5*). To ensure the timely gathering of the collection at Corinth, Paul would send the delegates (*8:16-24*) in advance to **make sure the gift you promised is ready**.\n\n
9:6	idm152908					 Paul turns to agriculture for an illustration of the benefits of generosity. **A farmer** who expects a rich harvest must sow many seeds.\n\n
9:7	idm152915					 It is the spirit of giving that counts, **“For God loves a person who gives cheerfully.”** Cheerfulness in giving is contrasted with giving **reluctantly** (literally *out of sorrow*) or **in response to pressure**.\n\n
9:8	idm152925					 **As the Scriptures say:** The quotation from *Ps 112:9* supports the assurance that God, who provides for all human needs, will reward generosity.\n\n
9:10	idm152933					 The Corinthians’ **generosity** would be matched by God’s generosity (*9:10-11*). It would also meet **the needs** of Jewish Christians (*9:12*), honor God (*9:13*), show believers in Jerusalem that their Gentile brothers and sisters were genuine believers (*9:13*), and result in the Jewish believers’ intercessory prayer and **affection** for the Gentile believers (*9:14*). Paul envisioned a united, worldwide Christian church, composed of believing Jews and Gentiles who are all one in Christ Jesus (*Gal 3:28*; *Eph 2:11-22*), which would become a powerful witness to the Lord’s work of reconciliation.\n\n
10:1	idm152949					 In this section, Paul defends his ministry as an apostle. • These chapters pose several problems arising from a distinct change of tone and style. Chapters *1–9* are full of joy stemming from the reconciliation of sinners with God and of the Corinthians with Paul. Yet from this point on, Paul is on the defensive. These chapters are full of harsh words, bitter recriminations, passionate irony, and rebuke. The remarkable break at *10:1* has inspired a number of explanations: (1) These chapters might be a separate letter, perhaps the “severe letter” sent earlier to Corinth (*2:3-4*; *7:8-9*). (2) It might be that, while the majority of the church members were obedient to the appeal for reconciliation, there was still a rebellious minority to whom Paul addressed these four chapters. (3) More likely, a new situation had arisen since Titus first brought back his glowing report of restored harmony (*7:5-16*). In this scenario, some anti-Paul missionaries had arrived in Corinth and launched a virulent campaign against the apostolic message of good news (see *11:4*, *13-15*). They claimed that Paul was no real apostle or even a true Christian (*10:7*) and that he had no right to come to Corinth with the gospel message since it was territory that belonged to them (*10:15-16*). They brought an alien message (*11:4*) and exercised a domineering spirit. In short, they were doing Satan’s work (*11:13-15*). Paul, concerned upon hearing of this new situation, reasserts his apostolic authority and engages in a form of writing that is distasteful to him (*11:1*, *16-17*; *12:1*) by boasting of his weaknesses and trials. Paul’s apostolic authority is real and powerful, yet it is conditioned and controlled by the love exhibited by the crucified Jesus (*10:1*; *13:4-10*).\n\n
10:1	idm152971					 Paul states his own clear intentions and sincerity by defending himself against the suspicion that he is acting **from human motives**.\n\n
10:1	idm152978					 **you think I am timid in person:** See *10:10*. Paul could write **bold** letters at a distance, but they mistook his personal **gentleness and kindness** as weakness. However, they forgot that he had the authority of Christ (*12:19*; *13:3-5*, *7*, *10*; *1 Cor 4:21*).\n\n
10:3	idm152993					 A military metaphor enforces Paul’s rebuttal: Paul’s weapons have divine power over spiritual **strongholds** (see *4:3-4*).\n\n
10:7	idm153001					 The rival teachers were evidently claiming to be Christ’s representatives in some superior way that excluded Paul because of his weakness. Here he defines having true **authority** as distinct from being a domineering authoritarian. His authority was to build up God’s people, not to demolish them (see *13:10*), yet he intended to deal firmly with these rivals when he came to Corinth (see *13:1*).\n\n
10:10	idm153010					 **Paul’s letters** are sometimes difficult and **demanding***,* as other Christians also found (cp. *2 Pet 3:16*). • **in person he is weak:** Paul had no domineering presence, bulldozing people into submission (cp. *2 Cor 1:24*; *1 Cor 2:1-5*). The earliest descriptions of Paul’s personal appearance (*Acts of Paul and Thecla*, around AD 200) depict him as “a man of small height, almost bald, with crooked legs, but with a good body and eyebrows meeting. His nose was hooked, full of grace, for sometimes he appeared like a man and sometimes had the face of an angel.” • **his speeches are worthless:** Unlike Apollos (*Acts 18:24*), Paul was not an eloquent preacher or captivating orator when he came to Corinth (*2 Cor 11:6*; *1 Cor 2:3-4*). His message, however, was charged with a power no human rhetoric could command, as it was given in the Holy Spirit.\n\n
10:12	idm153029					 Paul now charges his enemies with a set of false values, since they attached great importance to themselves.\n\n
10:13	idm153035					 Paul had not trespassed on the limits God set for his missionary service, **which includes our working with you**. So he justifies his integrity and authority, insisting that when he first came to Corinth (*Acts 18:1-17*) he did so in response to God’s call. Paul was determined not to enter **someone else’s territory** (see *Rom 15:20*), but he was **the first to travel all the way to Corinth with the Good News of Christ**. His more recent opponents visited the church much later (*2 Cor 11:4*), so their claim to Corinth as their territory was empty.\n\n
10:17	idm153047					 Paul quotes *Jer 9:24* to the effect that all missionaries are directed by the Lord. So boasting **doesn’t count for much.** Only as the Lord praises us for our service can success have any significance.\n\n
11:1	idm153055					 Paul finds it necessary, if distasteful, to justify his actions because of the close link he claims with the church (*11:2*) and because his enemies were enticing the Corinthian believers away from Christ.\n\n
11:1	idm153062					 Paul takes on an ironic tone in saying, **I hope you will put up with a little more of my foolishness**. He again asks with irony, **Please bear with me** (or *But indeed you are putting up with me*, a translation that makes the irony even more pointed).\n\n
11:2	idm153071					 The church is called to be **a pure bride to one husband—Christ**. This metaphor goes back to the Old Testament, where Israel is the bride of the Lord (*Isa 54:5*; *62:5*). Paul saw himself as the “best man” (the bridegroom’s close friend) who acted for the bridegroom (cp. *John 3:29*).\n\n
11:3	idm153081					 The false teachers were pulling the Corinthian believers away from **pure and undivided devotion to Christ**. In this they are doing the work of Satan, just as **the serpent** did in Eden (*11:14*; see *Gen 3:4*, *13*).\n\n
11:4	idm153092					 The false missionaries in Corinth evidently preached a **different Jesus***,* **a different kind of Spirit***,* and **a different kind of gospel than the one** the Corinthians had **believed**. It is difficult to know exactly what these false teachers preached; most likely, they promoted a powerful, dominant Christ and sidelined the suffering of the cross. They probably saw themselves as equally powerful preachers, exempt from hardship and trial. Paul’s message, by contrast, centered on Christ crucified (*13:4*), and Paul’s own sufferings were a mark of true apostleship (*12:1-12*). The nature of this difference is the heart of Paul’s defense of his apostleship in chs *10–13*.\n\n
11:5	idm153107					 These false teachers claimed authority as **“super apostles,”** and they despised Paul’s lack of sophisticated eloquence (*10:10*).\n\n
11:7	idm153115					 Paul was **preaching God’s Good News** . . . **without expecting anything in return**. Paul’s policy as a church planter (*1 Cor 9:3-14*) was to earn his living by his trade of tentmaking (*Acts 18:3*; *20:34*) rather than being supported by the new churches (*1 Thes 2:9*; *2 Thes 3:8-9*). His enemies in Corinth criticized him for this. In Greek thought, religious teachers could rightfully claim financial support; Paul’s refusal provided his enemies with an argument that his apostleship was counterfeit.\n\n
11:8	idm153128					 Paul had been **accepting** . . . **contributions** . . . **from Macedonia**—i.e., Philippi (*Phil 4:15-19*). Paul’s apparent inconsistency made the Corinthians suspicious of his motives or doubtful of his love toward them (*2 Cor 11:11*).\n\n
11:12	idm153139					 Paul’s motive in refusing to accept support from the Corinthians (*11:7-11*) was to show them what true Christian service is like in contrast to the ministry of **those who** were **looking for an opportunity to boast**.\n\n
11:13	idm153148					 Paul fiercely condemns the false teachers in Corinth (cp. *Gal 1:6-9*). Although the false teachers wanted to claim that their work was just like Paul’s (*2 Cor 11:12*), they were in fact **false apostles** and **deceitful workers** (cp. *Phil 3:2*). Just as Satan changed himself into **an angel of light** to deceive Eve (as described in the Jewish apocryphal book *The Life of Adam and Eve*), so **his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness**. Satan’s servants claim to be God’s servants, but their **deeds** are **wicked***,* and their **punishment** is sure (cp. *2 Cor 5:10*).\n\n
11:16	idm153167					 Paul plays the part of a boastful **fool** (see also *12:11-13*) so that he may present his true credentials as a suffering apostle. The intruders’ arrogant spirit impels Paul to adopt a style of writing that matches their behavior, all in irony.\n\n
11:19	idm153175					 The Corinthians were proud of their capacity to understand deep religious issues, and they valued teachers who made a pretense of learning. Paul came with a different agenda (*1 Cor 2:1-16*).\n\n
11:20	idm153182					 The Corinthian church had welcomed the intruders even when they exploited and insulted them. They even saw Paul’s refusal to exploit them as **too “weak.”**\n\n
11:21	idm153189					 Rather than boasting about his strengths and successes like the false teachers did, Paul boasts in weakness and defeat, pointing away from himself and toward God.\n\n
11:22	idm153195					 **Are they Hebrews? So am I:** A Jewish heritage was seen by Paul’s opponents as a qualification for ministry (see *Phil 3:5*). • **Are they Israelites? So am I:** An Israelite was a member of the covenant community by circumcision (cp. *John 1:47*; *Rom 9:4*). Paul had this badge also and was in fact a Pharisee, a most devoted follower of Torah (*Acts 26:4-5*; *Rom 11:1*; *Phil 3:5-6*). • **Are they descendants of Abraham?** This is yet another of Paul’s opponents’ claims to God’s favor based on ethnic identity. Elsewhere, Paul clarifies who can truly be called *Israelites* and *descendants of Abraham* (see *Rom 2:28-29*; *Gal 3:16*, *26-29*). Here, he ironically adopts the erroneous perspective of his opponents to beat them at their own game.\n\n
11:23	idm153215					 **I have served him far more!** Paul’s service to Christ had entailed Christlike sufferings and toils. Some of the difficulties in this litany are recorded in Acts.\n\n
11:23	idm153222					 **in prison more often:** E.g., see *Acts 16:22-23*. Clement of Rome says that Paul was imprisoned a total of seven times. • **thirty-nine lashes:** This punishment was prescribed in *Deut 25:1-3*. **The Jewish leaders** punished Paul as a renegade Jew, and he **faced death again and again**.\n\n
11:25	idm153234					 **Three times I was beaten with rods:** Paul suffered this Roman punishment at Philippi, though as a Roman citizen he should have been exempted (*Acts 16:22-24*, *37*). • **Once I was stoned:** At Lystra (*Acts 14:19*). • **Three times I was shipwrecked:** These events are otherwise unknown; Paul’s shipwreck on the voyage to Rome would come later (*Acts 27:1-44*).\n\n
11:26	idm153247					 Paul’s **many long journeys** are recorded in *Acts 13–28*. These trips involved facing **danger** and **enduring** hardship.\n\n
11:28	idm153257					 In addition to physical difficulties, Paul felt the **burden** of **concern** (or *anxiety*) **for all the churches**. No church gave Paul more cause for concern than Corinth.\n\n
11:30	idm153267					 **the things that show how weak I am:** Paul develops this theme in *12:1-10*.\n\n
11:32	idm153275					 As a final “boast” of his weakness, Paul tells the story of his escape from **Damascus** a few years after his conversion (see *Acts 9:23-25*; *Gal 1:15-18*). • **King Aretas** IV of Nabataea controlled Damascus only after AD 37, following the death of the emperor Tiberius (see Josephus, *Antiquities* 18.5.1-3); the mention of Aretas dates Paul’s escape from Damascus between AD 37 and the end of Aretas’s reign in AD 39 or 40.\n\n
12:1	idm153289					 Paul’s accusers at Corinth leveled the charge that Paul did not have ecstatic spiritual experiences. He was no mystic, they said, but a plain person with no impressive gift (see *10:10*). So even though Paul’s authority did not come from **visions and revelations from the Lord***,* he reveals his secret that he did, in fact, have such experiences.\n\n
12:1	idm153298					 **This boasting will do no good:** See *study note on 11:21b-29*.\n\n
12:2	idm153306					 **I was caught up** (literally *I know a man in Christ who was caught up*): In Greek, Paul demurely uses third person to speak of himself. • **The third heaven** is a Jewish expression for the immediate presence of God. • **fourteen years ago:** That is, about AD 43.\n\n
12:3	idm153317					 Paul wasn’t sure whether he was in a trance or actually taken to heaven. • **But I do know that I was caught up:** Literally *But I know such a man,* *that he was caught up;* see *study note on 12:2*.\n\n
12:5	idm153327					 Paul could **boast** about his **experience** (*12:2-4*), but it was no source of confidence in his ministry. He never makes mystical experience a proof of his apostolic authority—his **life** and his **message** must be the proof. He instead boasts about his **weaknesses** (*11:23-33*).\n\n
12:7	idm153340					 We do not know what the **thorn in** Paul’s **flesh** was (cp. *Num 33:55*; *Ezek 28:24*; *Hos 2:6*); we only know that its purpose was to **keep** him **from becoming proud***,* to prick the bubble of pride. • It was **a messenger from Satan**—that is, something or someone evil—so Paul prayed to the Lord **to take it away**. The Lord answered each petition the same way: **“My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness.”** Paul’s human weakness was an opportunity for **the power of Christ** to **work through** him by God’s grace. Paul accepted his suffering because Christ’s strength showed itself through his weakness.\n\n
12:11	idm153359					 Paul reviews his apostolic credentials; he continues to play the role of **a fool***,* making proud boasts because his detractors have forced him to do so (see *study note on 11:16-29*). Paul, too, has a commission as **an apostle***,* one sent by God himself, with all the **signs** to validate it.\n\n
12:11	idm153371					 **“super apostles”:** See *11:5*.\n\n
12:12	idm153379					 Included in Paul’s credentials was his ability to deal **patiently** with difficult people such as the Corinthians.\n\n
12:13	idm153386					 **The only thing I failed to do** refers to his not taking payment for his services (see *11:7-11*). • **Please forgive me for this wrong!** This request is ironic and tongue-in-cheek.\n\n
12:14	idm153395					 **the third time:** Paul’s first visit was his initial evangelism at Corinth (*Acts 18:1-18*); the second was the unscheduled “painful visit” (*2 Cor 2:1*). Paul contemplates what he hopes will be a happier visit, but there is still some suspicion and a need to clear the air. • **I will not be a burden:** Paul did not want their money but rather that they would fully accept his authority. That is why he would **gladly spend** himself for them rather than accept payment from them.\n\n
12:16	idm153406					 Some of the Corinthians **still** believed that Paul had deceived them **by trickery**. They might have insinuated that Paul was helping himself to the proceeds of the collection for the Jerusalem church (chs *8–9*). The answer to this charge is a reminder of the integrity of **Titus** and the **other brother** (see *8:18-24*). The integrity of Paul and his associates should debunk such false charges.\n\n
12:19	idm153418					 Paul is not simply offering a defense of his conduct and motives; he wants to assure his **dear friends** of his genuine love and Christian service for the well-being of the church.\n\n
12:20	idm153425					 Paul feared encountering renewed rebellion and resistance during his upcoming visit, with the Corinthians relapsed into their old ways. • **and you won’t like my response:** If Paul had to, he would deal sternly with flagrant sinners (cp. *1:23–2:17*; *1 Cor 4:21*).\n\n
12:21	idm153434					 Paul fears that **God will humble me in your presence**—a reprise of the previous visit (*2:1*), when the Corinthians had rebuffed and humiliated Paul. • The vices listed were among the Corinthians’ **old sins** (see *6:14–7:1*; *1 Corinthians Book Introduction*, “Setting”).\n\n
13:1	idm153445					 Announcing his intention to return to Corinth **the third time** (see *study note on 12:14-15*), Paul found confirmation of his plan in **the Scriptures**. The reason for this quotation is not clear, but perhaps, given the context of *Deut 19:15*, Paul wanted to **warn them** that every transgression (listed in *2 Cor 12:20-21*) would be judged on his arrival. The **two or three witnesses** against the Corinthian offenders were Paul’s letters or visits and the promise of his coming *the third time.*\n\n
13:3	idm153459					 **Christ speaks through me:** Paul represented Christ to the Corinthian congregation, and he would exercise **God’s power** in dealing with them. • Paul’s weakness was patterned on the humiliation of Christ, who **was crucified in weakness** (see *8:9*). Paul’s judgment on the sinners would be tempered by the constraint of Christ’s love (*5:14-21*). • **We, too, are weak:** Paul’s humanity was frail, yet he could draw on Christ’s strength (*12:10*).\n\n
13:5	idm153472					 The issue is clear cut: If they cannot recognize that **Jesus Christ** is living **among** them, they are the ones who **have failed the test of genuine faith** (literally *are disproved*). There is a play on words here: They were looking for “proof” of Paul’s apostolic authority, but Paul urges them, **Test yourselves** (or *Prove yourselves*). The lack of Christ’s presence would disprove their authenticity as Christians. But Paul himself has demonstrated that he has **not failed the test of apostolic authority** (literally *not been disproved*).\n\n
13:7	idm153486					 Whatever the problems Paul faced at Corinth, there is no doubt about his chief desire. He cherished the highest good for these people, that they would **become mature** and **strong**. Paul was always concerned to promote the welfare of his people, even when rebuking them.\n\n
13:7	idm153494					 **that you will not do what is wrong:** They would do wrong by embracing the false teachers who had appeared on the scene (*11:5*, *13-15*; see *study note on 10:1–13:13*). • **even if that makes it look like we have failed:** Paul’s motivation in ministry is to be faithful, not to appear successful (*1 Cor 4:2*). He patterned his service on Jesus Christ himself (*2 Cor 13:4*), who was outwardly weak and an apparent failure in dying on the cross, but who is now victorious as he lives by the mighty power of God.\n\n
13:9	idm153507					 **become mature:** This Greek word sometimes carries the idea of *repair* or *completion,* of restoring something to its proper condition, as in a return to good health (a related word is used in *13:11*, “grow to maturity”; *Mark 1:19*, “repairing”; *1 Thes 3:10*, “fill”; *Heb 13:21*, “equip”; *1 Pet 5:10*, “restore”).\n\n
13:10	idm153521					 Paul did not want **to deal severely** with the Corinthians by punishing the offenders (*12:21*). He wanted to exercise his apostolic **authority** in a positive way, but his ministry required him both to **strengthen** and to **tear** . . . **down** (cp. *Jer 1:10*). • **to strengthen you** (or *to build you up*): This is Paul’s favorite expression for a stable Christian community (see *Eph 4:12*), in which the Lord lives both in and among the believers (*2 Cor 13:5*).\n\n
13:11	idm153538					 The letter’s conclusion includes Paul’s final appeal (*13:11*), greetings (*13:12-13*), and a blessing (*13:14*).\n\n
13:11	idm153547					 **These last words** are Paul’s final instructions. • **Be joyful:** See also *Phil 3:1*; *4:4*. • **Grow to maturity:** See *study note on 2 Cor 13:9*—Paul’s encouragement might be that they aim for restoration. • **Encourage each other:** The need for encouragement has been very prominent in 2 Corinthians, beginning with *1:3-7*. • **Live in harmony:** Literally *Be of the same mind* (as in *Phil 2:1-4*).\n\n
13:12	idm153564					 **a sacred kiss:** The kiss was a common Jewish form of salutation, not only a sign of personal affection. Common in the New Testament church (*Rom 16:16*; *1 Cor 16:20*; *1 Thes 5:26*; *1 Pet 5:14*), it may have a significance in worship services in uniting fellow believers (the “kiss of peace”). The word for *sacred* (Greek hagiō) is the same word that is translated **God’s people** (literally *the saints*; Greek hagioi) in the next sentence. • **God’s people here** were the believers in the place from which Paul was writing in Macedonia.\n\n
13:14	idm153581					 Paul closes his letter with a prayer and blessing. He invokes the three persons of the Trinity, with **the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ** (see *8:9*) coming first. This is because we are always relying on Christ’s sacrificial love, which reconciles us to **God** the Father (*5:18-21*) and unites us through the **fellowship of the Holy Spirit** with all our fellow believers. • **The love of God** provides for our needs and graciously restores us to his family. • **The fellowship of the Holy Spirit** means our fellowship with the Spirit, who joins Christians together into a unity (*Eph 4:3*; *Phil 2:1*).\n\n
