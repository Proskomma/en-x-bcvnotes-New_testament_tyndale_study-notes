1:1	idm163176					 **Paul** usually begins with a short introduction followed by greetings and the invocation of **grace and peace**.\n\n
1:1	idm163184					 **Paul, a prisoner:** It is traditionally thought that Paul was writing from prison in Rome, but it is also possible that he was writing earlier from Ephesus, much closer to Philemon’s home in Colosse (see *Philemon Book Introduction*, “Date and Place of Writing”). • **Timothy** was one of Paul’s closest co-workers (see “*Timothy*” Profile). • **co-worker:** Philemon was active in ministry for Christ.\n\n
1:2	idm163195					 This is not a private letter to Philemon alone but is addressed also to his family and church. • **Apphia** was probably Philemon’s wife. • **soldier:** The servant of Christ is involved in a war and must be prepared to stand firm in the face of opposition (*Eph 6:10-17*). • **Archippus** was probably Philemon’s son (also mentioned in *Col 4:17*). • **the church that meets in your house:** The early Christians met together in private homes (see also *Rom 16:5*; *1 Cor 16:19*; *Col 4:15*).\n\n
1:3	idm163210					 **You** is plural, referring to all those mentioned in *1:2*. • **Grace and peace** represent traditional Greek and Hebrew greetings, respectively; they are now understood as gifts from God (cp. *Rom 5:1-2*).\n\n
1:4	idm163220					 In his letters, Paul usually thanks God for the faith and love of his readers and mentions his prayers for them (*Rom 1:8-12*; *1 Cor 1:4-9*; *2 Cor 1:3-11*; contrast *Gal 1:6-10*). Ancient Greek letters occasionally included a section of thanksgiving following the greeting.\n\n
1:5	idm163230					 It is by **faith** in Christ that we are saved, and it is by **love** for fellow Christians that we live out our salvation.\n\n
1:6	idm163238					 This verse can be translated in different ways. Paul is hinting that Philemon should be gracious toward Onesimus in light of God’s goodness to Philemon (cp. *1:10*, *17-19*).\n\n
1:8	idm163246					 The reason **why** Paul was **asking a favor** was Philemon’s reputation as a gracious, loving person (*1:5-7*). Paul **could demand it** by his authority as Christ’s apostle, but **love** leads Paul to request rather than demand. • **Paul, an old man:** Paul appeals to the respect due to older people as well as to his status as **a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus***,* which would only increase a fellow Christian’s respect.\n\n
1:10	idm163260					 **show kindness:** In the Roman world, runaway slaves could be treated harshly with whipping, branding, or even execution, at the owner’s discretion. • **Onesimus** was Paul’s spiritual **child** because he became a believer through Paul’s ministry.\n\n
1:11	idm163269					 **Onesimus** means “useful.” • **hasn’t been of much use** (literally *useless*) . . . **very useful:** This might be a play on words (cp. *1:20*). Onesimus was **now** serving others and proclaiming the Good News. At last he had become what his name means.\n\n
1:13	idm163281					 Paul hints at his desire that Philemon choose to free Onesimus to serve as Paul’s helper (also *1:21*). The Christian life is a free response to God’s grace (*Rom 12:1*; *Eph 4:1*; *Col 3:12-13*).\n\n
1:15	idm163291					 **you lost Onesimus** (literally *he went away*): This might be a euphemism for running away, in order not to mention Onesimus’s offense directly. • **so that you could have him back forever:** It is implied that God providentially arranged events to lead to Onesimus’s salvation.\n\n
1:16	idm163300					 Though Onesimus was still legally Philemon’s **slave***,* Philemon must think of him as **a beloved brother** and be committed to his well-being. • **both as a man and as a brother in the Lord:** Brotherhood in Christ must now transform their whole relationship in both the natural and spiritual realms.\n\n
1:18	idm163310					 Onesimus might have stolen some things from Philemon’s home or had a debt to pay off when he ran away.\n\n
1:19	idm163316					 Paul guarantees his promise with his signature. He typically dictated his letters to a secretary; on occasion, as here, he wrote something in his own hand. • your very soul: That is, his salvation. Philemon owed Paul much more than anything Onesimus might have owed him. Whether this means Philemon was converted directly or indirectly through Paul’s preaching is not clear (cp. *Col 1:7*).\n\n
1:20	idm163325					 **do me this favor:** Or *let me have this benefit;* Greek onaimēn (“favor, benefit”) might be a play on the name Onesimus, which can mean “beneficial” (cp. *1:11*).\n\n
1:21	idm163335					 **and even more:** Paul might be hinting that he would like to see Onesimus released (cp. *1:13-14*), or he might simply be expressing confidence in Philemon’s kindness.\n\n
1:22	idm163343					 Paul’s request for **a guest room** in anticipation of his visit reinforces his request that Philemon treat Onesimus kindly. At his coming, he would see how Onesimus had been treated.\n\n
1:23	idm163350					 Paul usually closes his letters with greetings from others and a benediction. Cp. *Col 4:7-18*; Paul’s letters to the Colossians and to Philemon were probably carried to Colosse at the same time by Tychicus and Onesimus.\n\n
1:23	idm163357					 **Epaphras** was a native of Colosse who first brought the Good News to Philemon and his family (*Col 1:7*; *4:12*).\n\n
1:24	idm163366					 These men are also mentioned at the end of Colossians (*Col 4:10*, *14*). • **co-workers:** They helped Paul spread the Good News. • **Mark:** See “*John Mark*” Profile. • **Aristarchus** was a faithful associate of Paul for many years (*Acts 19:29*; *20:4*; *27:2*). • **Demas** was a co-worker who later abandoned Paul (*2 Tim 4:10*). • **Luke:** See “*Luke*” Profile.\n\n
