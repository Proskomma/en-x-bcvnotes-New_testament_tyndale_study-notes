1:1	idm158444					 **Timothy** was one of Paul’s closest co-workers. So close was their relationship and so significant Timothy’s ministry that Paul included him as one of the senders of this letter as well as of 2 Corinthians, Philippians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, and Philemon.\n\n
1:2	idm158451					 **Colosse** was situated in the Lycus River valley in western Asia Minor, about 120 miles (193 kilometers) east of Ephesus and 10 miles (16 kilometers) southeast of Laodicea. Its location on an important Roman road meant that it was influenced by the social and religious currents of the time. • **brothers and sisters:** Greek adelphoi, a generic term commonly used to refer to members of the same family, both male and female.\n\n
1:3	idm158460					 This opening section begins with a thanksgiving, typical of New Testament letters. Paul thanks God for the Colossians’ progress in the faith and prays that they might understand it even better. With this prayer, Paul hints at his concern about the influence of false teachers.\n\n
1:4	idm158466					 **God’s people** (literally *holy ones,* or *saints*): In the New Testament, all Christians are *saints,* people who have been specially set apart by God as his own holy people (*3:12*).\n\n
1:5	idm158477					 The Colossian Christians’ **confident hope** gives them a secure foundation for their faith and love (*1:4*). • **What God has reserved** for believers has not yet been fully revealed, but it already exists **in heaven**.\n\n
1:6	idm158487					 **bearing fruit everywhere by changing lives:** The **Good News** is effective to change lives and bring about spiritual growth (cp. *1:10*).\n\n
1:7	idm158496					 **Epaphras** (see also *4:12-13*; *Phlm 1:23*) was probably converted when Paul ministered in Ephesus (see *Acts 19:10*) and then returned to Colosse to bring the **Good News** to his own town.\n\n
1:9	idm158507					 Paul prays that God would grant his readers deeper understanding of the Good News and its full expression in their lives. Spiritual growth yields a clearer and deeper comprehension of Christian truth and conduct that pleases the Lord, through which a believer will have the endurance and patience to stand firm against evil (*1:11*).\n\n
1:12	idm158514					 **always thanking the Father:** Humble gratitude to God for salvation is a powerful antidote to the lure of false teaching (see also *2:7*; *3:17*; *4:2*). • The **inheritance** is what God has promised his people (e.g., see *Deut 3:28*; *Ps 33:12*; *Ezek 44:28*). In the New Testament, *the inheritance* consists of salvation and final deliverance (see also *Eph 1:11*; *Titus 3:7*; *Heb 9:15*).\n\n
1:15	idm158532					 Paul presents Jesus as the supreme creator (*1:15-17*) and redeemer (*1:18-20*). The series of short statements, the exalted conceptions of Christ, and the parallelism in language and thought strongly suggest that these verses quote an early Christian hymn about Jesus that Paul applied to the situation of the Colossian Christians.\n\n
1:15	idm158540					 **visible image:** In the Greek translation of the Old Testament, eikōn (“image, representation”) is used to refer to human beings having been made in the image of God (*Gen 1:26-27*) and also to the wisdom figure in Jewish writings (see *Wisdom of Solomon* 7:25-26). The New Testament writers speak about **Christ** as God’s wisdom to help explain his significance (cp. *1 Cor 1:24*, *30*). • **He existed before anything was created and is supreme over all creation** (or *He is the firstborn of all creation*): This phrase figured prominently in early Christian debates about the nature of Christ. *Firstborn* does not mean he was created; it is a title, drawn from the Old Testament, indicating supremacy of rank and priority in time (see, e.g., *Ps 89:27*).\n\n
1:16	idm158557					 **Thrones, kingdoms, rulers, and authorities in the unseen world** refer to various spiritual powers. This line emphasizes Christ’s supremacy over these beings who were getting so much attention from the false teachers (see *2:18*). • **Everything was created through him and for him:** Christ is both the one through whom all things were created and the goal of all creation.\n\n
1:18	idm158566					 **head of the church:** The Greek word kephalē (head) usually has the sense of *authority over* or *chief* when Paul uses it as a metaphor (see also *2:10*, *19*; *1 Cor 11:3-10*; *Eph 4:15*; *5:23*). • **which is his body:** The metaphor of the church as Christ’s body expresses the essential unity of Christ and the church (see also *Col 1:24*; *2:19*; *3:15*; *Eph 1:23*; *2:16*; *4:4*, *12*; *5:23*, *30*). • **supreme over all who rise from the dead** (or *the firstborn from the dead*): See *study note on Col 1:15*.\n\n
1:19	idm158594					 **God in all his fullness** emphasizes that God has chosen to reveal himself fully in Jesus Christ. Seeing Jesus and understanding him therefore means seeing and understanding God (see *John 14:6-11*). The false teachers seemed to be saying that Christians needed to look to other spiritual beings to find out more about God (see *Col 1:16*, *20*). But Christ is sufficient for all our knowledge of God (cp. *2:8-9*).\n\n
1:20	idm158605					 Through Christ, God has **reconciled everything to himself***,* reestablishing his rule over all creation, including both the spiritual and the earthly realms.\n\n
1:21	idm158613					 Paul applies the truth of *1:15-20* to the Colossian Christians. As people who have been reconciled to God, they enjoy a new spiritual status and need to stand firm in the truth they have been taught.\n\n
1:21	idm158620					 The phrase **once far away from God** probably refers to their condition as Gentiles (see *Eph 2:12*).\n\n
1:22	idm158628					 The Colossians, like all believers, were **holy and blameless** in God’s sight not because of their own perfection but because they had been **reconciled** with God through Christ’s **death**.\n\n
1:23	idm158637					 **preached all over the world** (literally *preached to every creature under heaven*): The point of Paul’s hyperbole (exaggeration for emphasis) is that centers for preaching the Good News had been established in key cities throughout the Roman world (see also *1:6*).\n\n
1:24	idm158646					 Paul considers his own role in the widespread preaching of the Good News (*1:23*).\n\n
1:24	idm158653					 **I am participating in the sufferings of Christ** (literally *I am filling up what is lacking in the sufferings of Christ*): While the redemptive suffering of Christ is unique and completely finished, Christ still suffers through his people in a world hostile to the message of redemption. Christ and his church will continue to suffer until God’s purposes in this world are complete (see also *Mark 13:19-23*; *Rom 8:17-18*; *1 Thes 3:3*).\n\n
1:26	idm158664					 The concept of a **secret**, hidden at one time and then revealed, is based upon Jewish apocalyptic ideas. Jewish thinkers conceived of God’s entire plan as already existing in heaven, hidden until God should draw back the curtain and reveal it. The Good News, especially for the Gentiles, had been kept secret until it was revealed in Christ.\n\n
2:1	idm158671					 Paul introduces his concern to strengthen his relationship with the Colossians, whom he had not met, and to counter the heretical ideas which threatened their Christian community. • Laodicea was located 10 miles northwest of Colosse.\n\n
2:2	idm158677					 **God’s mysterious plan:** See *1:26*; **Christ himself** personifies this plan.\n\n
2:3	idm158686					 Paul builds on *1:15-20*: Christ alone is sufficient for our spiritual understanding.\n\n
2:6	idm158693					 In the face of the false teachers’ enticing arguments, Paul exhorts the Colossians to stand firm in their faith in Christ, for **in Christ lives all the fullness of God***,* and their spiritual experience is complete in him.\n\n
2:8	idm158701					 The Greek word philosophia referred to everything from the metaphysics of Plato to the religious teaching of cults. Paul does not condemn philosophy per se, but only **empty** philosophical speculation that stands opposed to the Good News. • **the spiritual powers of this world:** or *the spiritual principles of the world;* also in *2:20*): This phrase may refer to elementary teaching that is characteristic of this world (see *Heb 5:12*), or to spiritual beings who were thought to have a decisive influence on the course of events (see also *Col 2:15*, *20*; *Gal 4:3*).\n\n
2:11	idm158716					 **Christ performed a spiritual circumcision:** Spiritual conversion to Christ is the Christian counterpart to physical circumcision. • **the cutting away of your sinful nature** (literally *the cutting away of the body of the flesh*): Just as Jewish boys have the flesh of their foreskin cut off to mark their initiation into the people of God, so believers have metaphorical *flesh* (translated *sinful nature*) cut off when they come to Christ.\n\n
2:12	idm158727					 **you were buried with Christ when you were baptized:** As in a roughly parallel passage (*Rom 6:3-6*), Paul assumes a strong identity between believers and Christ. In God’s sight, we really were *with Christ* when he was buried and **raised**, so we experience the benefits of what Christ did for us. Paul can link that identification with Christ to baptism because water baptism was so closely related to conversion in the early church.\n\n
2:14	idm158737					 **the record of the charges against us:** The Greek phrase suggests an IOU that we have all signed. Since we are unable to pay what we owe, it stands *against us.* The law of God required obedience that people are unable to give, but God has forgiven our debt through the work of Christ (*2:13*).\n\n
2:15	idm158746					 **He shamed them publicly by his victory** (literally *he led [them] in triumphal procession*): The Roman army would celebrate a great victory with a triumphal procession. The victorious Roman general would lead the humiliated captives from his campaign into the conquered city. The image vividly captures the glorious victory that God, through the cross of Christ, has won over all hostile spiritual powers (see also *Eph 4:7-11*).\n\n
2:16	idm158755					 Paul repudiates the false teachers and their demands, explaining why their appeal comes from **human teachings** (see *2:8*). They advocated various rules of conduct that had no basis in Christ.\n\n
2:16	idm158763					 **what you eat or drink:** Religious teachings that prohibited certain kinds of food and drink were widespread in the ancient world. The Old Testament does not prohibit drinking alcohol, but many pious Jews who lived in pagan cultures did abstain (cp. *Dan 1:8-16*). • Many ancient religious groups, including the Jews, celebrated the **new moon** with various **ceremonies** (see *Num 10:10*; *Ps 81:3*; *Isa 1:13*). • Jewish **Sabbaths** were set forth in the law of Moses and celebrated by Jews as an essential part of their religion. Christians could continue to observe the Sabbath if they wanted to, but Paul asserts that Christians have liberty on this matter (see *Rom 14:5*) and that it is wrong for anyone to insist on Sabbath observance as a necessary expression of Christian piety.\n\n
2:17	idm158778					 The **reality** of Christ was anticipated by the Old Testament rituals, which Paul calls **shadows** (see also *Heb 10:1*).\n\n
2:18	idm158787					 **the worship of angels:** People in the first century were fascinated with spiritual beings. Some Jews believed that angels were present during their times of worship, and some might even have worshiped them. • The false teachers were evidently **saying** they had **had visions** that established certain rituals as requirements for the community.\n\n
2:20	idm158796					 **You have died with Christ:** Christ’s death on the cross marked his victory over the spiritual powers (*2:15*), so we who participate in his death have likewise been set **free from the** evil **spiritual powers of this world** (see *2:8*).\n\n
2:23	idm158807					 **they provide no help: **Not only are such rules rooted in the world rather than in Christ (*2:19*), they are also ineffective **in conquering a person’s evil desires**.\n\n
3:1	idm158816					 Paul summons the Colossians to a new way of thinking that results in a new lifestyle.\n\n
3:1	idm158822					 **set your sights on the realities of heaven:** Christians live on earth, but because they have been raised with Christ, their true being is oriented to the spiritual realm over which Christ rules. In contrast, the rules and regulations of the false teachers focused on the earthly realm (*2:22*). \n\n
3:3	idm158830					 **you died to this life:** See *2:20*. • What is now **hidden** will one day be **revealed** (cp. *1:26*). We cannot now see that Christ is enthroned at the right hand of God and that we have been raised to new life with Christ. But by faith in the Good News, we know that these things are true. When Christ returns in glory, his supremacy will be evident to all and our relationship to him will be a direct experience.\n\n
3:5	idm158841					 **So put to death:** Our death to this life (*3:3*) must be made real in the way that we live day by day. • **a greedy person is an idolater:** Greedy people pursue the objects of their greed—money, sex, power, possessions—in the place of God, with the hope of finding satisfaction in those things.\n\n
3:6	idm158850					 **coming:** Some manuscripts read *coming on all who disobey him.* In the Greek text, these words occur verbatim in *Eph 5:6*, so it is possible that an early scribe added them here, either intentionally or accidentally.\n\n
3:8	idm158859					 **get rid of** (literally *take off*): Taking off clothes is a metaphor for ridding our lives of practices that interfere with our walk with the Lord (see *Rom 13:12*; *Eph 4:22*, *25*; *Heb 12:1*; *Jas 1:21*; *1 Pet 2:1*).\n\n
3:9	idm158873					 **your old sinful nature . . . your new nature:** Paul contrasts old and new identities (see also *Rom 5:12-21*; *6:6*; *Eph 4:22-24*). Believers strip off their old life and put on Christ’s new life, allowing him to be Lord and to guide the way they live.\n\n
3:11	idm158883					 **barbaric, uncivilized:** Literally *Barbarian, Scythian.* The Greeks mocked people from other cultures for their inability to speak Greek well, claiming they could only say “bar bar” (hence the word *barbarian*). The Scythians were tribes that had settled on the north coast of the Black Sea and were widely viewed as fierce and crude (see Josephus, *Against Apion* 2.38). All such distinctions do not **matter** in our relationship with God through **Christ**.\n\n
3:12	idm158895					 Paul describes the nature of the new life of people who have been raised with Christ (*3:1*). Their virtues and activities contribute to the peace and strength of the Christian community.\n\n
3:15	idm158902					 Just as Christ is one, so there can be only **one body** of Christ (see *1:18*; *Eph 4:4-6*). Allegiance to Jesus as Lord must transcend differences and will result in **peace** (harmonious relationships).\n\n
3:16	idm158912					 **Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs** are songs of praise and worship (see *1 Cor 14:26*; *Eph 5:19*). The prototype is the book of Psalms.\n\n
3:17	idm158921					 **as a representative of the Lord Jesus** (literally *in the name of the Lord Jesus*): In the Bible, a person’s name represents that person. To do something *in the name* *of the Lord Jesus* is therefore to act in a way that is in harmony with his identity and under his authority.\n\n
3:18	idm158931					 This series of exhortations is called a *household code.* Paul gives instructions to wives (*3:18*), husbands (*3:19*), children (*3:20*), fathers (*3:21*), slaves (*3:22-25*), and masters (*4:1*). Such codes appear in Greco-Roman writers and elsewhere in the New Testament (see *Eph 5:22–6:9*; *1 Pet 2:18–3:7*).\n\n
3:18	idm158946					 To **submit** is to recognize one’s place under someone else in a social order. Such submission always implies that God is at the top and that his will is paramount (cp. *Acts 4:19-20*; *5:29*).\n\n
3:19	idm158955					 The exhortation to wives to submit to their **husbands** is immediately followed by a command to the husbands to **love** their **wives** (see also *Eph 5:25-30*; *1 Pet 3:7*).\n\n
3:22	idm158966					 **Slaves** have **earthly masters** whom they must obey. Slavery was central to the life and economy of the ancient world, and the New Testament never attacks the practice as such. However, Christian faith establishes relationships that change the nature of the social structure (see *Phlm 1:15-16*). • **and that the Master you are serving is Christ:** All Christians, both slave and free, serve a higher Master, whose will is paramount.\n\n
4:1	idm158976					 **Masters:** Christian slave owners had to recognize that they, too, were slaves bound to obey Jesus Christ, their Master **in heaven** who treats all people with dignity and grace.\n\n
4:2	idm158984					 New Testament letters often end with an exhortation to pray, along with requests for prayer.\n\n
4:2	idm158990					 **with an alert mind:** The Greek verb behind this phrase is used in the New Testament to portray the need for Christians to be watchful in light of Christ’s return (*Matt 24:42*; *25:13*; *Mark 13:35*, *37*; *1 Thes 5:6*; *Rev 3:3*; *16:15*).\n\n
4:3	idm159004					 **that God will give us many opportunities** (literally *that God might open for us a door*): An open door is a metaphor for an opportunity to proclaim the Good News (see also *Acts 14:27*; *1 Cor 16:9*; *2 Cor 2:12*). • **his mysterious plan concerning Christ:** See *Col 1:26-27*; *2:2*. • **That is why I am here in chains:** Paul’s dedication to preaching the Good News had led to his imprisonment (see *Colossians Book Introduction*, “Date and Occasion of Writing”).\n\n
4:5	idm159020					 **make the most of every opportunity** (literally *buy up the time*): Like people who are buying up a product offered at a good price, Christians are to “buy up” every opportunity God gives them to share the Good News and to serve others.\n\n
4:6	idm159028					 **attractive** (literally *seasoned with salt*): Salt is both a seasoning and a preservative (see *Matt 5:13*). Paul might be encouraging Christians to speak to unbelievers in words that are well chosen and winsome. The rabbis occasionally referred to wisdom as *salt,* so Paul might also be exhorting Christians to speak wisely.\n\n
4:7	idm159038					 Most New Testament letters end with a series of greetings and references to co-workers and travel plans, but this part of Colossians is longer than normal. Paul, being unable to travel, might have been seeking to ensure that the Colossians maintain connections with his co-workers. This would help them not to fall for the enticements of the false teachers.\n\n
4:7	idm159044					 **Tychicus** was from the province of Asia, where Colosse was located (*Acts 20:4*). He worked with Paul especially in that province (*Eph 6:21*; *2 Tim 4:12*). He was later sent to work with Titus in Crete (*Titus 3:12*). Tychicus probably carried this letter along with the letters known as Ephesians and Philemon.\n\n
4:9	idm159055					 **Onesimus** was the runaway slave whom Paul was sending back to his master Philemon (see the book of Philemon).\n\n
4:10	idm159062					 Of the six people named, five are also mentioned in *Phlm 1:23-24*.\n\n
4:10	idm159069					 **Aristarchus** was a common name, but he was probably the same man from Thessalonica (*Acts 19:29*; *20:4*) who accompanied Paul on his voyage to Rome (*Acts 27:2*). Acts does not suggest that *Aristarchus* was also under arrest, so perhaps he was **in prison with** Paul voluntarily, sharing his confinement in order to encourage him and assist him in ministry. • **Mark, Barnabas’s cousin,** had gone with Barnabas and Paul on their first missionary journey but had left them before the journey was finished (*Acts 13:13*). That desertion led to a split between Paul and Barnabas as the second journey was about to begin (*Acts 15:37-40*). Paul and Mark were apparently now reconciled (see also *2 Tim 4:11*; *Phlm 1:24*). • **As you were instructed before:** There is no other record of this communication.\n\n
4:11	idm159087					 **Jesus (the one we call Justus)** is mentioned only here in the New Testament. The surname *Justus* is included because *Jesus* (which means *the Lord saves*) was a common name among Jews in the first century.\n\n
4:13	idm159097					 **Laodicea and Hierapolis** were the two most important cities in the Lycus River valley. The fact that Epaphras prayed for the believers in Colosse and in these nearby cities suggests that he was the pioneering evangelist in all three cities.\n\n
4:14	idm159104					 **Luke, the beloved doctor,** is well known as the author of Acts and the Gospel bearing his name. This verse is the sole evidence for two facts about Luke: He was a doctor, and he was not a Jewish believer (see *Col 4:10-11*). • In contrast to the other people mentioned in this passage, no details are given about **Demas**. Perhaps Paul did not know him well. Demas later deserted Paul (*2 Tim 4:10*).\n\n
4:15	idm159114					 **Nympha and the church that meets in her house:** In the first two centuries of the Christian church, almost all believers met for worship in private homes. Nothing else is known of Nympha.\n\n
4:16	idm159121					 **you should read the letter I wrote to them:** Various attempts have been made over the years to identify the letter to the Laodiceans with a New Testament letter or fragment, but it is most likely that Paul’s letter to the Laodicean church has been lost.\n\n
4:17	idm159128					 **Archippus:** See also *Phlm 1:2*. We have no way of knowing more about **the ministry the Lord gave** him.\n\n
4:18	idm159137					 Here is my greeting in my own handwriting—Paul: Like most ancient letters, Colossians was probably dictated by Paul to a scribe, or *amanuensis,* who would have been trained to write neatly and compactly. As a way of authenticating the letter, Paul added his own handwritten greeting at the end (cp. Paul’s comment in *2 Thes 2:2*).\n\n
