1:1	idm52966					 Upon hearing about Jerusalem’s ruined condition, Nehemiah prayed for God’s grace (*1:1-11*) and asked the king to send him to Jerusalem (*2:1-8*). When he arrived, he challenged the people to rebuild the city’s wall (*2:11-20*).\n\n
1:1	idm52975					 **Artaxerxes** I reigned over Persia from 465 to 424 BC. • **The fortress of Susa** was the Persian king’s winter palace.\n\n
1:2	idm52984					 **Hanani** might have been one of Nehemiah’s blood **brothers***;* this word in Hebrew can also mean “fellow countryman” (e.g., *Deut 1:16*, “fellow Israelite”). • **the Jews who had returned:** See *Ezra 2:64-65*; *8:1-14*.\n\n
1:3	idm52997					 **The wall of Jerusalem has been torn down:** This probably refers to a recent setback in Jerusalem (see *Ezra 4:6-23*), not to the Babylonian conquest in 586 BC. • **disgrace:** Foreigners could gloat about the destroyed city, using it as evidence that Israel’s God was too weak to protect it (cp. *Joel 2:17*; *Mic 7:8-10*).\n\n
1:4	idm53009					 Nehemiah fervently **mourned, fasted, and prayed** for about four months (cp. *1:1*; *2:1*), deeply concerned for Jerusalem.\n\n
1:5	idm53018					 Nehemiah’s prayer includes praise (*1:5*), confession (*1:6-7*), remembrance of God’s promises (*1:8-9*), and petition (*1:10-11*). Nehemiah recognized that Israel’s current situation was not a failure of God’s **covenant of unfailing love**. Israel’s persistent sin had brought about the punishments entailed in the covenant.\n\n
1:6	idm53029					 **I confess that we have sinned:** Like Ezra (*Ezra 9:5-15*) and Daniel (*Dan 9:4-19*), Nehemiah identified with the sins of his people, made no excuses, and accepted both his individual responsibility and the responsibility of the larger covenant group that had sinned against God.\n\n
1:8	idm53038					 Nehemiah recalls God’s curse on sin and his promise of restoration (*Deut 4:25-31*; *30:1-5*). • **The place . . . for my name to be honored** was Jerusalem.\n\n
1:10	idm53047					 Nehemiah alludes to God’s long-standing covenant relationship with the Israelites: He had **rescued** them in the Exodus (*Deut 9:29*) and made them his **servants**.\n\n
1:11	idm53056					 **making the king favorable to me:** Nehemiah knew God could influence the king’s **heart** to **be kind** to Nehemiah. • As **cup-bearer** Nehemiah tasted the king’s wine to make sure it was not poisoned, which provided him daily access to King Artaxerxes.\n\n
2:1	idm53066					 **never . . . sad in his presence:** A servant was not to let his personal life interfere with serving the king.\n\n
2:2	idm53073					 Nehemiah **was terrified** because he had let his sadness show, and he did not know how the king would respond if he told him the reason for his sorrow (King Artaxerxes had previously ordered that Jerusalem not be rebuilt, *Ezra 4:21-22*). Nehemiah was not putting on an act; his deep mourning showed despite his best efforts to conceal it.\n\n
2:3	idm53081					 Nehemiah affirmed his loyalty with the customary **long live the king** (cp. *Dan 2:4*), yet he did not deny his sadness.\n\n
2:4	idm53089					 **With a prayer:** The king was subject to **the God of heaven***,* and Nehemiah needed God’s guidance and provision as he made his request.\n\n
2:5	idm53098					 **send me to Judah to rebuild the city:** Artaxerxes’ openness to this proposal seems surprising in light of Jerusalem’s history of rebellions against Persia (*Ezra 4:17-23*). The king might have viewed Nehemiah’s plan as a way to solidify his own control over a troubled area of his empire.\n\n
2:6	idm53106					 **How long will you be gone?** (see *5:14*): Nehemiah probably requested a short period of time initially, later asking for an extension.\n\n
2:8	idm53114					 **Temple fortress** might refer to the Tower of Hananel or the Tower of the Hundred. • **the gracious hand of God was on me:** Nehemiah knew that **the king granted these requests** because God was sovereignly guiding the king to do so.\n\n
2:9	idm53123					 Because Nehemiah was a government official, he had an armed escort of **officers and horsemen** for his trip to Jerusalem (cp. *Ezra 8:22*).\n\n
2:10	idm53131					 Some of the local, non-Jewish officials **were very displeased** because rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem would change the balance of political power in favor of the Jews. • **Sanballat** was the main leader of opposition to Nehemiah’s rebuilding efforts. • **the Horonite:** He was probably from Upper or Lower Horon (Beth-horon, *Josh 16:3*), approximately 12 miles (19 kilometers) northwest of Jerusalem. Sanballat’s name might indicate that he was a descendant of the Assyrian people imported by Sargon II after the fall of Samaria (*2 Kgs 17:24*). A document discovered in Egypt indicates that he eventually became governor of Samaria in 408 BC.\n\n
2:12	idm53143					 Nehemiah needed firsthand knowledge of the condition of the walls to present credible **plans** for their reconstruction and to rally the labor he would need. He conducted his survey secretly **after dark** to avoid detection by his opponents. His inspection covered only the southern part of the city.\n\n
2:13	idm53151					 **Jackal’s Well** might have been En-rogel, a water source located about 400 yards [365 meters] south of the city, or the pool of Siloam, which is filled by water flowing through Hezekiah’s meandering, serpentine tunnel. • The **Dung Gate** (called the “Gate of Broken Pots” in *Jer 19:2*) at the southern end of the western wall (see *Neh 3:13*) led to the Hinnom Valley, where inhabitants of the city threw their garbage.\n\n
2:14	idm53161					 The **King’s Pool** was either the pool of Siloam or another pool southeast of the city; both were created from the overflow of the Gihon Spring (see *2 Kgs 20:20*).\n\n
2:16	idm53169					 Nehemiah kept his inspection and rebuilding plans secret from both the Persian and **Jewish leaders** to prevent opposition from being organized.** But now** Nehemiah was effectively positioned to lead the rebuilding effort. • **what trouble we are in:** The broken walls brought **disgrace** on the city and reflected negatively on God; Jerusalem certainly did not look like the “city of the great King” (*Ps 48:2*).\n\n
2:18	idm53180					 Evidence of God’s clear involvement (*2:8*) is a strong motivator in any project. Nehemiah had God’s guidance, the king’s permission, the necessary letters to procure lumber, and a plan to lead the project. So the people enthusiastically agreed to begin working.\n\n
2:19	idm53187					 Nehemiah’s enemies immediately **scoffed** and tried to stop progress. These opponents were dangerous because of their potential ability to discourage the people and undermine Nehemiah’s credibility. • **Are you rebelling against the king?** This serious charge could bring death (see also *Ezra 4:6-23*).\n\n
2:20	idm53196					 The title **God of heaven** communicated to Persian audiences that Israel’s true God was not a minor local deity. Nehemiah remained focused on obeying his sovereign by building the walls.\n\n
3:1	idm53203					 This summary of the people who rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem moves in a circle around the city, starting at the northeast corner and moving west, then south, east, and north.\n\n
3:1	idm53209					 The rebuilding of the walls and gates around the northern section of the city was divided into eight work groups.\n\n
3:1	idm53215					 **Eliashib the high priest***,* the grandson of Jeshua (*12:10*), led the priests in working on the northern wall around the Temple. • **The Sheep Gate** was where the people brought in their sheep on their way to sacrifice at the Temple. • **The Tower of the Hundred** and **the Tower of Hananel** were two major military towers along the northern wall (*12:39*; *Jer 31:38*; *Zech 14:10*).\n\n
3:3	idm53230					 At the **Fish Gate***,* people sold fish from the Sea of Galilee and the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n
3:4	idm53238					 **Meremoth:** See *Ezra 8:33*. • **Meshullam** had given his daughter in marriage to a son of Tobiah (*Neh 6:18*; see also *10:20*).\n\n
3:5	idm53249					 The **leaders** of **Tekoa** might have been influenced by Geshem (*2:19*), who controlled the area south of Tekoa.\n\n
3:6	idm53258					 These verses describe work done on the walls and gates on the western side of Jerusalem. Even people from outside the city and people having wealth or more delicate occupations participated.\n\n
3:6	idm53264					 **The Old City Gate:** The oldest part of Jerusalem sat on an eastern hill that ran north to the Temple Mount.\n\n
3:7	idm53271					 **Gibeon** and **Mizpah** were about six miles (10 kilometers) north of Jerusalem.\n\n
3:8	idm53279					 The **Broad Wall** was located in the newer, western section of the city.\n\n
3:9	idm53286					 Nehemiah wisely assigned people to work near their homes both to motivate them to do good work and to save them traveling time.\n\n
3:11	idm53292					 The **Tower of the Ovens** on the western wall of the city might have been a place to bake bread or to burnish pottery (*Jer 19:1-2*).\n\n
3:13	idm53300					 **Zanoah** was a village about thirteen miles (21 kilometers) southwest of Jerusalem.\n\n
3:14	idm53307					 These verses focus on the reconstruction of the southern tip of the city where the Hinnom Valley and Kidron Valley meet.\n\n
3:14	idm53313					 The **Beth-hakkerem district** might have been about two miles (3.2 kilometers) south of Jerusalem (at modern Ramat Rachel) or five miles (8 kilometers) west (at modern Ain Karem).\n\n
3:15	idm53320					 The **Mizpah district** was about six miles (10 kilometers) north of Jerusalem. • The **king’s garden** was a lush area east of the pool of Siloam near where the Kidron and Hinnom Valleys meet, possibly at the King’s Pool (*2:14*).\n\n
3:16	idm53329					 These verses describe the building of the new eastern wall.\n\n
3:16	idm53335					 The **district of Beth-zur** was located just north of Hebron. • The **tombs of David’s family** might refer to where King David was buried (*1 Kgs 2:10*; *11:43*; *2 Chr 21:20*; *Acts 2:29*), and the **House of the Warriors** might have been a tomb for David’s mighty men (*2 Sam 23:8-39*).\n\n
3:24	idm53349					 The **angle and the corner** refers to an unidentified turn in the wall.\n\n
3:25	idm53356					 The **tower that projects up from the king’s upper house** and **the court of the guard** might refer to a royal complex on the **hill of Ophel***,* just south of the Temple area.\n\n
3:28	idm53366					 This final group of workers connected the repairs to the **Sheep Gate**, where the work had started (*3:1*). • **Horse Gate:** See also *2 Chr 23:15*; *Jer 31:40*. • **East Gate:** See also *1 Chr 26:14*, *17*; *2 Chr 31:14*; *Ezek 10:19*; *40:21-22*.\n\n
4:2	idm53383					 The Persians had stationed **Samarian army officers** in Jerusalem to keep peace. • **poor, feeble Jews:** Sanballat’s mockery had an element of truth: The Jews were not rich, powerful, or many in number. However, Sanballat failed to realize the strength of the God whom the Jews served. • **Do they think . . . by just offering a few sacrifices?** Sanballat might have been mocking a sudden increase in sacrifices at the Temple as the Israelites dedicated their work to the Lord. • **rubbish . . . charred:** When fire destroyed Jerusalem (586 BC), it heated the stones, causing some to crack and crumble. The people used these stones to restore the walls.\n\n
4:4	idm53394					 Nehemiah prayed intensely for God to stop those who opposed God’s will. Nehemiah’s practice was to cry out to God in times of need (*2:4*; *5:19*; *6:14*; *13:14*, *22*, *29*, *31*).\n\n
4:5	idm53407					 **Do not ignore their guilt:** See also “*Prayers for Vengeance*” Theme Note.\n\n
4:6	idm53415					 **half its height:** Perhaps 10–12 feet (3.0–3.7 meters) tall, since some scholars speculate that the original wall was 20–24 feet (6.0–7.3 meters) high.\n\n
4:7	idm53422					 Israel’s enemies from the north (**Sanballat**), the south (**Arabs**), the east (**Ammonites**), and the west (**Ashdodites**) were enraged by the speed and success of Jerusalem’s reconstruction, which threatened these opponents’ political power in the region.\n\n
4:9	idm53432					 **we prayed . . . and guarded:** This wise approach to the threat involved both relying on God and doing what was needed.\n\n
4:11	idm53439					 The relentless psychological attack of Israel’s **enemies** was having a negative effect on morale.\n\n
4:12	idm53446					 **They will come from all directions and attack us!** Jews from the surrounding areas might have been exhorting the people working in Jerusalem to return to their villages to avoid being killed in an attack.\n\n
4:13	idm53453					 Nehemiah countered by positioning **armed guards** near the most vulnerable **parts of the wall**. He also made sure opponents outside the wall could see the forces ready to defend the city.\n\n
4:14	idm53461					 The strongest motivation for hope was Israel’s **great and glorious** God, who had delivered his people from mighty nations before (cp. *2 Chr 32:7-8*; see *Exod 14:13-14*; *Deut 8:1-3*; *20:3*; *Josh 10:25*). Another motivation was to protect their own families and properties.\n\n
4:15	idm53473					 Nehemiah gave the credit to **God** (see also *2:20*; *6:16*), who **had frustrated them** through the prayers of the people, the 24-hour patrol, the open display of force, and the confidence in God’s protection.\n\n
4:18	idm53483					 Through the **trumpeter***,* Nehemiah could **sound the alarm** to direct workers to any portion of the wall that might be attacked.\n\n
4:20	idm53492					 **our God will fight for us!** Drawing on Israel’s ancient holy war tradition (*Exod 14:14*; *Deut 1:30*; *20:4*; *Josh 10:14*; *23:10*), Nehemiah encouraged the people that victory was certain if they trusted in the Lord.\n\n
4:23	idm53504					 Nehemiah and the other leaders were not elitists who relaxed while others toiled.\n\n
5:1	idm53510					 Although severe financial problems threatened to derail the wall’s completion (*5:1-5*), Nehemiah worked out a solution (*5:6-13*).\n\n
5:2	idm53518					 Some farmers had diverted their efforts from raising crops to building the wall, leaving their **large families** in need of **food to survive**. Someone had to feed their families, or they would have to stop work on the wall and go home to work in their fields.\n\n
5:3	idm53526					 Some small landowners had **mortgaged** everything to survive. The **famine** made the problem worse because grain was scarce and the price of food naturally increased.\n\n
5:4	idm53534					 **to pay our taxes:** Despite the famine, the Persians did not cancel the onerous royal tribute due at harvest time.\n\n
5:5	idm53541					 **we must sell our children into slavery:** See *Exod 21:1-11*. These families were desperate to survive.\n\n
5:6	idm53549					 Nehemiah was **very angry***,* but he controlled himself, thought it over, and then **spoke out** in order to resolve the conflict rather than make it worse (see *Jas 1:19-20*).\n\n
5:9	idm53559					 **walk in the fear of our God:** See *Lev 25:35-43*. • **avoid being mocked:** See also *Neh 1:3*; *2:19*; *4:1-3*.\n\n
5:10	idm53571					 **I myself . . . have been lending:** Nehemiah and his associates were evidently making loans without burdening people. Nehemiah’s example was the solution: to give financial help without pushing people further into debt by **charging interest** (see *Deut 15:7-11*).\n\n
5:11	idm53580					 Nehemiah demanded that the rich lenders **restore their fields** and **repay the interest** (literally *the hundredth part*), which they should not have collected (see also *Exod 22:25*; *Lev 25:35-37*). The literal *hundredth part* suggests that the interest was one percent per month, lower than the twenty percent annual rate found in some documents of that time, or the sixty percent annual rate charged at Elephantine in Egypt. But even a relatively low rate of interest violated God’s covenant.\n\n
5:12	idm53592					 **made the nobles and officials swear:** Both God and the community would hold them accountable.\n\n
5:14	idm53599					 This section describes Nehemiah’s consistent policy of servant leadership and personal generosity.\n\n
5:14	idm53605					 This is the first mention of Nehemiah’s status as **governor***,* a position not mentioned when the king first sent Nehemiah to Jerusalem. • Persia’s government officials usually **drew** an **official food allowance** from the local population, but Nehemiah and his associates instead purchased food out of their regular pay.\n\n
5:15	idm53615					 **The former governors** were probably Nehemiah’s immediate predecessors, not Sheshbazzar (*Ezra 1:8*, about ninety years earlier) or Zerubbabel (*Hag 1:1*, about eighty years earlier).\n\n
5:19	idm53624					 Nehemiah’s prayer for God to **remember** and **bless** him was a sign of his dependence on God.\n\n
6:1	idm53632					 With the financial crisis solved (ch *5*), the narrative returns to how the enemies of rebuilding tried to intimidate or eliminate Nehemiah.\n\n
6:2	idm53639					 The **plain of Ono***,* located near Lod (*Ezra 2:33*), was probably a neutral site west of Jerusalem, where Nehemiah would have been unprotected.\n\n
6:6	idm53648					 **planning to rebel . . . you plan to be their king:** Those who had opposed the restoration of the Temple had used similar tactics (see *Ezra 4*). • At times in Israel’s history, **prophets** did play a role in establishing a new king (cp. *1 Sam 9:16*; *2 Kgs 9*).\n\n
6:11	idm53659					 A good leader would not **run from danger** but would stand as an example to his people.\n\n
6:15	idm53666					 **just fifty-two days:** Everyone realized that **the help of our God** was what made such success possible (see also *1:11*; *2:8*, *18*, *20*; *4:15*, *20*).\n\n
7:1	idm53680					 **the wall was finished:** The actual dedication of the wall is reported in *12:27-34*. • The **Levites** usually assisted with caring for the Temple area, including guarding its gates.\n\n
7:2	idm53689					 **a faithful man who feared God:** Hanani displayed two leadership characteristics favored by Nehemiah and God (see also *5:9*, *15*; *Dan 6:4*; *Luke 16:10-12*; *1 Pet 5:12*).\n\n
7:3	idm53701					 The **gatekeepers** were apparently supposed to close the gates during the time in the afternoon when people were resting and were not prepared to defend the city from attack. Elsewhere, similar language refers to the portion of the day when the sun is the hottest and people retreat inside (*Gen 18:1*; *2 Sam 4:5*).\n\n
7:4	idm53710					 Most people lived in the country near their fields, so **the population** of Jerusalem **was small**. Apparently, a **registration** would encourage more people to settle in and near Jerusalem (*7:73*).\n\n
7:6	idm53720					 **Jewish exiles . . . returned to Jerusalem and the other towns:** These lists were not complete (the individual numbers do not add up to the total number in *7:66*), but they were the best records available to verify who truly was a Jew.\n\n
7:7	idm53728					 **Their leaders:** Sheshbazzar (see *Ezra 1:8*) is omitted here and in *Ezra 2:2*, suggesting that both lists were developed after the people had settled in their towns and after Sheshbazzar had died.\n\n
7:8	idm53737					 **the family of:** This list is similar to that in *Ezra 2:3-35*, with some differences in names and the number of people in each family. People were listed by family (*Neh 7:8-25*) and by the town where they settled (*7:26-38*). Most of the towns were north of Jerusalem.\n\n
7:39	idm53747					 Nehemiah wanted to be sure that only legitimate **priests** and **Levites** served in God’s Temple.\n\n
7:60	idm53755					 The **descendants of Solomon’s servants** apparently assisted the Levites by carrying wood or sweeping the floor (cp. *Ezra 2:55-58*). They might have been Gibeonites (*Josh 9:23-27*; *1 Chr 9:35-44*) or war captives (*Num 31:30-47*).\n\n
7:61	idm53766					 **they could not prove that they . . . were descendants of Israel:** They had no genealogical records.\n\n
7:65	idm53773					 **Urim and Thummim . . . sacred lots:** See study notes on *Exod 28:30*; *Lev 8:8*.\n\n
7:66	idm53782					 The total number **42,360** agrees with *Ezra 2:64*, but the numbers for the families listed total only 31,089. The individual numbers for each family might not include young children, or the list might simply be incomplete.\n\n
7:70	idm53790					 **Some of the family leaders gave gifts** as their forefathers had done when sacred buildings were built (*Exod 25:2-7*; *35:4-9*; *2 Kgs 12:1-21*). This money supplemented gifts by Israelites who stayed in Babylon (*Ezra 1:6*) and by the Persian kings (*Ezra 6:8*).\n\n
7:73	idm53802					 This section, perhaps originally a part of Ezra’s personal memoirs, describes how Ezra’s teaching of God’s law brought renewal of the people’s commitment to serve God and follow his instructions. Spiritual revival accompanied the civic work of Ezra and Nehemiah.\n\n
7:73	idm53808					 **their own towns throughout Israel:** Each family settled in the land that had been inhabited by their ancestors before the Exile.\n\n
8:1	idm53815					 The **Water Gate** was located toward the middle of the eastern wall of Jerusalem, south of the Temple and east of the palace ruins (*3:26*; *12:37*). There was plenty of open space so no one would be excluded.\n\n
8:2	idm53824					 **on October 8:** The people came together on this day to celebrate the Festival of Trumpets (*Lev 23:24-25*), which marked the beginning of a new year in the postexilic calendar.\n\n
8:3	idm53832					 The timeframe **from early morning until noon** provided about six hours for reading and interpreting (*8:7-8*). • **understand** (see also *8:2*, *8*, *12*): This was not just a ritual reading of the law. It included explanations, insight, and application.\n\n
8:4	idm53844					 These thirteen people were apparently community leaders. Some might have helped Ezra roll the scroll as he read.\n\n
8:5	idm53850					 The people **all rose to their feet** out of respect for God’s word (*Job 29:8*). Apparently, they stood the whole time Ezra was reading.\n\n
8:6	idm53858					 **Ezra praised the** Lord**:** See also *1:5*; *9:32*; *Deut 10:17*; *Jer 32:18*; *Dan 9:4*. • **Amen!** A statement of agreement (see *Neh 5:13*). Lifting hands (*Ps 28:2*) and bowing in humble worship were signs of reverence for God and submission to his word.\n\n
8:7	idm53875					 The **Levites** always had the role of teaching people God’s word (*Deut 33:10*; *Mal 2:5-6*). In this case, they probably **explained the meaning** of the Hebrew Scriptures to smaller groups of people in Aramaic. Most of the people spoke Aramaic, the language of Babylon, rather than Hebrew as their first language. Jewish leaders eventually translated large portions of the Hebrew Bible into Aramaic, allowing people to hear and study the Bible in a language they understood.\n\n
8:9	idm53885					 **Ezra the priest and scribe:** See *study note on Ezra 7:6*. • **Don’t mourn or weep . . . today is a sacred day:** God touched the people’s hearts, prompting them to regret their failures to keep God’s laws. While weeping is an appropriate response to sin (see *Ezek 9:4*; *Luke 6:21*), Ezra and Nehemiah encouraged the people to rejoice at what God had done. Because this New Year’s festival was to be a time of joy (*Num 29:1-6*), weeping would have destroyed the spirit of the day.\n\n
8:10	idm53897					 **Rich foods** such as meat were eaten only on a special occasion. • **Sweet drinks** referred to unfermented juice, in contrast to the vinegar of the common laborer (see *Ruth 2:14*). • It is right to **share** with those who have need (see *Deut 15:11*; *Job 29:16*; *Prov 31:20*; *Matt 6:2-3*; *Acts 4:34-35*).\n\n
8:15	idm53912					 **make shelters in which they would live during the festival:** The Festival of Shelters commemorated that the people of Israel had lived in tents during their wilderness journey (*Lev 23:33-43*; see also *Num 29:12-39*; *Deut 16:13-15*).\n\n
8:16	idm53922					 **The Ephraim Gate** might have been located on the north side of Jerusalem, facing toward the territory of the tribe of Ephraim (see *12:39*).\n\n
8:17	idm53930					 **since the days of Joshua:** Although Israel had observed this festival on numerous occasions (*1 Kgs 8:2*; *2 Kgs 23:22*; *2 Chr 7:8-10*; *30:26*; *35:18*; *Ezra 3:4*), this was an exceptional celebration.\n\n
8:18	idm53943					 **Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God:** The law was to be read every seven years at the Festival of Shelters (*Deut 31:10-12*). It reminded the people of the covenant stipulations and of God’s past acts of grace.\n\n
9:2	idm53951					 **Those of Israelite descent separated themselves from all foreigners as they confessed their own sins:** This sentence might allude to the problem of intermarriage with foreigners, as narrated in *Ezra 9–10*.\n\n
9:3	idm53959					 **They confessed their sins** after hearing God’s word (cp. *8:1-9*, *13-14*, *18*).\n\n
9:5	idm53969					 This long prayer confesses the nation’s sins and praises God for his compassion throughout history (cp. *Pss 105–106*; *135–136*). It prompted listeners to confess their own unfaithfulness and to call on God to be compassionate and forgive their sins.\n\n
9:5	idm53977					 The Levites’ prayer praised God for his **glorious** reputation, his sole divinity, his creation of the universe, his providential care for life on **earth,** and his worship by **angels.** Putting the focus on God brought Israel’s present circumstances into proper perspective.\n\n
9:7	idm53986					 God’s actions with **Abram**—calling him (*Gen 12:1-3*; *15:7*), giving him a new name and identity (*Gen 17:5*), making a covenant with him (*Gen 15:6-21*; *17:4-5*), and fulfilling his promises of land and descendants (*Gen 15:18-21*)—demonstrated God’s faithfulness and inspired confidence about what God would do in the future.\n\n
9:9	idm53999					 God had paid attention to his people’s **misery** under foreign domination (*Exod 2:23-25*; *3:7*; *14:10-14*), which was analogous to their present situation (*Neh 9:32-37*).\n\n
9:10	idm54010					 **You have a glorious reputation:** In the Exodus, God had demonstrated his character with plagues, parting the sea, and defeating the arrogant Egyptian army (*Exod 15:5*, *9-10*, *19*).\n\n
9:12	idm54020					 This prayer reminded the people of God’s miraculous direction of Israel in the wilderness (*Exod 13:21-22*), his personal appearance at **Mount Sinai** to reveal his covenant laws through Moses (see *Exod 19–20*), and his faithfulness in providing **bread . . . and water** (see *Exod 16:4*; *17:1-6*). Despite all of that, Israel’s **ancestors** had been **proud and stubborn** and **refused to obey** (see *Exod 32*; *Num 14:4*). Yet in his grace, God remained faithful and had compassion (see *Exod 34:6*) and provided his Spirit to direct and teach them (cp. *Exod 33:2*; *Num 11:17*).\n\n
9:24	idm54040					 **You subdued whole nations:** See *Josh 6–12*.\n\n
9:25	idm54048					 Cp. *Deut 6:10-11*; *8:6-10*. • **they were full and grew fat:** Prosperity proved to include spiritual danger (see *Deut 8:11-20*).\n\n
9:26	idm54058					 The prayer recounts the pattern in the book of Judges (see *Judg 2:11-23*).\n\n
9:28	idm54065					 The people did not learn from mistakes made in the period of the judges (*9:26-27*), and the same pattern of disobedience emerged during the subsequent monarchy (cp. *2 Kgs 17*). Despite the nation’s persistent disobedience (*Neh 9:29*), God was persistent in his **love***,* patience, compassion, and guidance through the **Spirit** and **through the prophets**.\n\n
9:32	idm54078					 **And now:** The prayer moves to the current situation, petitioning **the great . . . God**—who has **unfailing love**—for continued love and mercy to his people in their present difficult situation (*9:32*). The leaders recognized God’s justice in punishing them for their sins (*9:33-35*), and they lamented their enslavement under the Persians (*9:36-37*).\n\n
9:38	idm54090					 **The people***,* embracing the prayer, renewed their dedication to God and his word. They signed their names to indicate their commitment (*9:38–10:27*) and took an oath to live by the covenant (*10:28-39*).\n\n
9:38	idm54100					 **making a solemn promise . . . putting it in writing:** These actions indicate a serious vow of faithfulness to the covenant. The **sealed document** had legal standing.\n\n
10:1	idm54108					 The eighty-four names included **the governor: Nehemiah** (*10:1*), and a group of **priests** (*10:2-8*; cp. *12:1-7*), **Levites** (*10:9-13*; cp. *9:4-5*; *12:8-9*), and **leaders** (*10:14-27*; cp. *3:4-31*).\n\n
10:28	idm54126					 **separated themselves from the pagan people:** See *9:2*; cp. *Ezra 9–10*.\n\n
10:29	idm54135					 **swore a curse on themselves if they failed to obey the Law:** Cp. *Lev 26:14-35*; *Deut 28:15-62*.\n\n
10:30	idm54144					 Although the community had committed itself broadly to all the instructions in the law of Moses, some specific issues were being addressed in this commitment. These issues related to maintaining the purity of the community and worship at the Temple.\n\n
10:30	idm54150					 Cp. *Ezra 9–10*.\n\n
10:31	idm54157					 Ceasing trade on the Sabbath was necessary for covenant faithfulness (cp. *13:15-22*; see *Exod 16:29*; *20:8-11*; *31:15*; *Num 15:32-36*; *Amos 8:5*). • **Every seventh year:** See *Exod 23:10-11*; *Lev 25:2-7*; *Deut 15:1-3*.\n\n
10:33	idm54173					 **Bread of the Presence:** See *Lev 24:5-9*; *Num 28:1-8*. • **everything necessary:** With the money from the annual tax, priests could purchase the animals for daily sacrifices and maintain the **Temple** complex (cp. *2 Kgs 12:11-12*; see also *Exod 30:11-16*).\n\n
10:34	idm54186					 Because the fire **on the altar** burned continually (*Lev 6:12*), a good deal of wood was used. The Gibeonites provided it at an earlier time (*Josh 9:27*), but now it was a joint responsibility.\n\n
10:35	idm54195					 Offerings from the community provided food for **the priests** and **Levites***,* who had no allocations of agricultural land and no means of providing for themselves. These provisions came from **the first part of every harvest** (see *Exod 23:19*; *34:26*; *Num 18:12-13*; *Deut 26:1-11*), the redemption money of five shekels paid for the **oldest sons** and the **firstborn** of all the **herds and flocks** (see *Exod 13:13*; *34:20*; *Num 18:15-17*), as well as **a tenth of everything** (see *Num 18:21-24*; *Deut 14:22-29*).\n\n
10:37	idm54218					 The **Levites** collected the tithes **in all . . . rural towns** and sent a tenth of that collection to the Temple in Jerusalem (see *Num 18:25-32*).\n\n
11:1	idm54227					 The narrative returns to the issue of repopulating the secure city of Jerusalem (see *7:1-5*). The list of names roughly parallels the list in *1 Chr 9:2-17*.\n\n
11:1	idm54235					 **Sacred lots** were probably the Urim and Thummim (*10:34*; *Josh 7:14*, *16-18*; *14:2*).\n\n
11:4	idm54246					 **Perez** was one of Judah’s sons (*Gen 38:29*).\n\n
11:16	idm54254					 **The work outside the Temple** probably included collecting tithes from people and caring for the tithes in storehouses (*10:37-39*; see also *1 Chr 26:29*).\n\n
11:17	idm54263					 **a descendant of Asaph:** David had chosen Asaph and his sons to provide music for the Temple worship (*1 Chr 25:1-8*). Asaph’s descendants took up this role again when the new Temple was built.\n\n
11:21	idm54271					 **The hill of Ophel** was high ground just south of the Temple (*3:26*). It provided an ideal location to house those who worked in the Temple.\n\n
11:24	idm54279					 The **royal adviser** informed the king of events in Jerusalem and notified Jewish officials of the king’s **public administration** of Persian policies.\n\n
11:30	idm54287					 **all the way from Beersheba . . . to the valley of Hinnom:** Earlier descriptions of places where people settled concentrated on areas north of Jerusalem (ch *3*; *11:31-36*); this list (*11:25-30*) reflects progressive expansion of places where Jewish people lived as they occupied many of their preexilic towns, both north and south of Jerusalem.\n\n
12:1	idm54297					 These lists of priests and Levites include a list of those who originally returned from exile with Zerubabbel (*12:1-9*), a chronological list of high priests (*12:10-11*), and the priests and Levites who served at the time of Joiakim, the high priest at the time of Nehemiah and Ezra (*12:12-26*).\n\n
12:1	idm54306					 **priests and Levites who returned with Zerubabbel . . . and Jeshua:** See *Ezra 1:1-5*. Only those who could prove their priestly lineage could serve at the Temple, so it was important to maintain an accurate genealogical record of these families.\n\n
12:7	idm54314					 **leaders of the priests:** Cp. *Ezra 2:36-39*. • **Jeshua** was the high priest in Jerusalem when the people returned from captivity shortly after 538 BC (*Ezra 2:2*; *3:2*, *8*; *4:3*). He was still serving in 520 BC when Haggai and Zechariah encouraged the people to finish building the Temple (*Ezra 5:1*; *Hag 1:1*; *Zech 3:1*).\n\n
12:8	idm54332					 **Their associates . . . stood opposite:** To provide antiphonal singing (*12:24*; *Ezra 3:1-11*).\n\n
12:10	idm54341					 **Joiakim** probably served in the early years of Ezra’s service. • **Eliashib** and **Joiada** served during Nehemiah’s time (*3:1*; *13:4*, *28*). • **Johanan:** An Aramaic papyrus document from a Jewish colony that settled in Elephantine, Egypt (about 410 BC) and Josephus (*Antiquities* 11.5.4, AD 93) both mention Johanan serving after Nehemiah’s time.\n\n
12:12	idm54357					 This list was probably compiled **when Joiakim was high priest** (*12:12*) to verify the legitimacy of the priests and Levites who were in office. Except for the omission of Hattush (see *12:2*), this list contains the same names as *12:1-7*.\n\n
12:27	idm54367					 **The dedication of the new wall** probably happened shortly after its completion (*6:15-19*). This account probably came from Nehemiah’s personal memoirs.\n\n
12:27	idm54375					 Since few **Levites** had returned to live in Jerusalem (see *Ezra 2:40-42*; *8:15-19*), all those **throughout the land** were recruited to create two impressive choirs and orchestras. • **Netophathites** were from near Bethlehem (*1 Chr 2:54*). • **Beth-gilgal** was near Jericho. • **Geba** and **Azmaveth** were in the territory of Benjamin.\n\n
12:30	idm54390					 The dedication ceremony required that **the priests and Levites** be **purified** and ready to enter the Temple area (see *Exod 19:10*; *Num 8:5-7*).\n\n
12:31	idm54400					 This impressive march **proceeded southward along the top of the wall to the Dung Gate** at the southern end of the city (*3:13-14*). Then the procession continued north on the wall along the east side of the city, past the ruins of **the house of David** and up to the **Water Gate** (*3:26*; *8:1*) near the Temple.\n\n
12:35	idm54412					 Long, slender, metal **trumpets** were played for festive, joyous occasions (*1 Chr 13:8*; *15:23*; *16:6*, *42*; *Ezra 3:10*) by the descendants **of Asaph.**\n\n
12:38	idm54425					 **The second choir . . . went northward,** up the western wall past the **Broad Wall** (*3:8*), the **Old City Gate** (*3:6*), and the **Fish Gate** (*3:3*), then across the northern side of the wall until it came to the **Sheep Gate** (*3:1*) on the northeast corner of the Temple. • The **Guard Gate** might be the Inspection Gate (*3:31*).\n\n
12:43	idm54442					 This community celebration included everyone. God was the true source of their **great joy** because his power had enabled them to accomplish the huge task of rebuilding the walls. *Psalm 147* might have been written for this occasion.\n\n
12:44	idm54450					 **On that day***,* the day of the dedication of the wall (*12:44*; *13:1*), **men were appointed** to take care of the tithes and gifts given for the physical needs of the priests and Levites. Their duties were **to collect** the gifts of the people for the priests and Levites (*10:32-39*; see also *Exod 30:11-16*; *38:25-26*), to perform **the service of their God** (probably sacrifices; see *Lev 1–5*), and to oversee **the service of purification** of those people who were unclean. They also purified pans, knives, and clothing used in Temple worship as described in *Lev 11–15* (see also *1 Chr 23:28*).\n\n
12:46	idm54470					 **David** had given instructions for ordering the music at the Temple (*1 Chr 23–26*), and he had put **Asaph***,* along with Heman and Jeduthun, in charge of the music (*1 Chr 25:2-5*).\n\n
12:47	idm54481					 From the time of the first returnees to Jerusalem **in the days of Zerubbabel** in 538 BC (*Ezra 3:1*) until the time of **Nehemiah** around 445 BC, Israelites brought food for those working at the Temple. Most of the **Levites** lived in cities around the country; they collected the tithe and brought a tenth of what they received to the Temple in Jerusalem to support its ministry (see *Neh 10:38-39*).\n\n
13:1	idm54494					 On the **same day** the Temple workers were appointed (*12:44*), the text from *Deut 23:3-6* was read. It said that **no Ammonite or Moabite should ever be permitted to enter the assembly of God.** Nehemiah later discovered (*Neh 13:4-14*) that these teachings were no longer being observed.\n\n
13:4	idm54505					 **Eliashib the priest** (see *12:10*, *22*; *13:28*) had stopped following the practice of excluding the Ammonites and Moabites (*13:1*), and the people quit giving their tithes to the Levites (*13:10-12*). Now, Nehemiah corrected these problems.\n\n
13:4	idm54517					 **Eliashib**’s family intermarried with the families of Sanballat (*13:28*) and **Tobiah**. Both of these men were enemies of the Jewish community (*2:10*, *19*; *4:1*). Tobiah’s use of the storeroom meant there was less room to store tithes and gifts for the Temple workers (cp. *10:39*; *13:10-12*; *2 Chr 31:11*) and less space for supplies needed to conduct regular worship at the Temple (*Lev 2*).\n\n
13:6	idm54533					 Nehemiah had returned to Persia after twelve years of service in Jerusalem (445–433 BC). The text does not say how long he stayed there, but it was probably no longer than a year or two. When he arrived back in Jerusalem, he found Tobiah living in the Temple storeroom (*13:1-5*).\n\n
13:8	idm54541					 **I became very upset. . . . I demanded:** When people rejected God’s instructions, Nehemiah refused to be silent. • Everything associated with the Temple had to be **purified** and consecrated to God. The clothes that the priests and Levites wore (*Exod 29*), the priests themselves (*Lev 8–9*), the Temple building and altars (*Lev 16:15-33*), and all the holy things (*1 Chr 23:28*) were purified (cp. *2 Chr 29:5*, *15-19*).\n\n
13:10	idm54555					 With Tobiah using the storeroom, there had been no place to store tithes to feed the Levites and Temple singers (*Num 18:21-24*; see *Neh 12:44*, *47*). They had to farm outside of Jerusalem (*12:28-29*) to support themselves and could not serve in the Temple.\n\n
13:13	idm54565					 **These men had an excellent reputation:** Cp. *Acts 6:1-6*.\n\n
13:14	idm54573					 Because he stood up for God, Nehemiah asked God to **remember** his deeds and not abandon him in his time of need. Perhaps he experienced opposition from those he had corrected. See similar refrains in *13:22*, *29*, *31*.\n\n
13:15	idm54583					 Nehemiah instituted two additional reforms to restore proper Sabbath observance (*13:15-22*) and proper marriage practices (*13:23-31*). These two sections have similar structures: Nehemiah discovered a problem, corrected the problem, and asked God for his blessing.\n\n
13:15	idm54591					 Normal work was to cease **on the Sabbath** in order to keep it holy (*Exod 20:8-11*; *31:14-17*; *35:2-3*; *Jer 17:19-27*).\n\n
13:19	idm54602					 The Sabbath began at sunset on **Friday evening** and lasted until sunset on Saturday evening.\n\n
13:22	idm54609					 **Have compassion on me:** Nehemiah’s prayer implies that he felt the pressure of this unpopular decision. He knew that God’s **unfailing love***,* not his own popularity, would sustain him.\n\n
13:23	idm54618					 The earlier marriage reforms (*9:2*; *10:28*; *Ezra 9:1–10:44*) had not lasted. The children’s inability to speak Hebrew (**the language of Judah**) was disastrous because they could not read or understand the Scriptures.\n\n
13:25	idm54628					 When Nehemiah **called down curses on them***,* it was because the parents avoided Hebrew and did not teach their children the language of the Hebrew Bible. A curse called on God to remove his blessing on people. • **I beat some of them and pulled out their hair:** Apparently, some of the men did not accept Nehemiah’s rebuke at first, so he **made them swear in the name of God** not to intermarry with pagans.\n\n
13:26	idm54638					 **King Solomon** had led the nation **into sin by his foreign wives** (*1 Kgs 11*). If intermarriage with pagans was allowed to continue, the same apostasy would overtake the community. Nehemiah would not let that happen.\n\n
13:28	idm54647					 Even the family of **the high priest***,* who were supposed to be Israel’s spiritual leaders, had participated in the sin of intermarriage with unbelieving foreigners (cp. *Lev 21:14*). Nehemiah **banished** the offender, stripping him of status and removing his rights in the Jewish community.\n\n
13:29	idm54657					 **Remember them, O my God:** Many would probably resent Nehemiah’s aggressive attack on intermarriage in the family of the high priest. So he prayed for God’s judgment to fall on these spiritual leaders who **defiled the priesthood**.\n\n
13:30	idm54665					 These final verses summarize Nehemiah’s reform. The emphasis on **making certain** and making **sure** shows that Nehemiah checked to see that the people did what they agreed to. He held people accountable for their commitments and did not allow for half-hearted reform.\n\n
