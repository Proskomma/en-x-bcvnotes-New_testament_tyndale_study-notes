1:1	idm74681					 **Solomon** is the foremost authority on Israelite wisdom (see *1 Kgs 3:1-28*; *4:32*). Many **proverbs** are ascribed to Solomon, but he did not write all of them (see *Prov 22:17*; *24:23*; *25:1*; *30:1*; *31:1*).\n\n
1:2	idm74696					 This prologue explains the purpose of the book and identifies the different readers to whom it is addressed.\n\n
1:2	idm74702					 **Wisdom** is practical knowledge that involves ethical choices. Words such as *right, just,* and *fair* are associated with biblical wisdom. Gaining wisdom involves **discipline***,* an active, intentional training of energy toward wisdom and away from folly. The book of Proverbs encourages us to resist our natural sinful tendencies toward wrong behavior.\n\n
1:4	idm74713					 The **simple** are like empty containers. Wisdom and folly compete to fill their minds and hearts (see *9:1-18*).\n\n
1:6	idm74721					 Proverbs help the wise person to understand **riddles**. Here the Hebrew word (*khidoth*) indicates enigmas or paradoxes—difficult sayings that require interpretation (cp. *Judg 14:14*).\n\n
1:7	idm74730					 **Fear of the** Lord recognizes total dependence on God for everything, including knowledge and wisdom (*9:10*). It is not just a mental attitude but involves service, love, and obeying God’s laws (see *Deut 10:12-13*). Fear of the Lord is the basis of all **knowledge**. How can we understand life without knowing the most fundamental truth about it—that it is God’s creation?\n\n
1:8	idm74741					 **My child** (Literally *My son*): Like other wisdom literature of the ancient Near East, much of chs *1–9* is a **father**’s (and occasionally, a **mother’s**) instruction to a son. Because the son is being trained to follow in his father’s profession, much of the teaching concerns the son’s occupation. The NLT usually translates the term as *child,* since the lessons are applicable to both sons and daughters.\n\n
1:8	idm74753					 There are two paths (*1:15*) in the book of Proverbs: a wise, just way and a foolish, evil way. The parents represent the wise way and encourage their child to follow it.\n\n
1:9	idm74760					 **crown you . . . chain of honor:** Ornaments often represent wisdom and its rewards (see also *3:22*; *4:9*). This imagery inspires readers to pursue wisdom with diligence.\n\n
1:10	idm74769					 The father warns his child not to join a gang of **sinners** in their plan to pounce on the **innocent***,* for their evil actions will rebound on themselves (see *28:10*; *Pss 9:15*; *35:8*). The evil way is a path of violence and robbery.\n\n
1:12	idm74781					 **like the grave:** Hebrew *like Sheol.* In the Old Testament, Sheol is the abode of the dead. It is not necessarily associated with punishment.\n\n
1:17	idm74789					 Birds will not go into an obvious **trap***,* but **greedy** people will. By resorting to violence and robbery, they will be violently robbed of **life**. They might be killed in the attempt or executed when caught. Even if sinners prosper until the end of their lives, they will find judgment in death, while the righteous will be in God’s presence (see *Ps 1*).\n\n
1:20	idm74800					 The author personifies wisdom as a woman (the Hebrew noun translated wisdom, *khokmah**,* is grammatically feminine) and encourages his son to embrace her (see *3:18*; *8:1–9:6*).\n\n
1:22	idm74810					 Three main words in Proverbs describe those who lack God’s wisdom. **Simpletons** (Hebrew *pethim*) have not hardened themselves against God’s wisdom and are most open to correction (see *1:4*). **Fools** (Hebrew *kesilim*) have heard God’s wisdom but resist it. **Mockers** (Hebrew *latsonim*) not only resist wisdom but even ridicule it.\n\n
1:23	idm74823					 Wisdom invites all three groups (*1:22*) to **come** so she can make them **wise**. An intimate relationship with Wisdom means entering an intimate relationship with God, the foundation of true knowledge (*1:7*; see *Job 28*).\n\n
1:24	idm74834					 **You ignored my advice**—i.e., the call of God himself (see *Ps 14*). God calls to us through creation (*Ps 8*; *Rom 1:18-20*) and Scripture (*2 Tim 3:16-17*; *2 Pet 1:20-21*).\n\n
1:28	idm74846					 **I will not answer:** If a person has not sought wisdom before calamity strikes, it is often too late to learn.\n\n
1:29	idm74853					 **they hated knowledge:** There is no middle ground in the language of Proverbs. One either loves and embraces Wisdom or hates and rejects her.\n\n
1:31	idm74860					 Evil people suffer the consequences of their own actions (see *1:15-19*); God will ensure that sinners receive their proper punishment (see *Matt 25:44-46*; *Heb 10:29*; *2 Pet 2:9*).\n\n
1:33	idm74870					 Truly wise people are **untroubled by fear**. They know that God is in control, and wisdom guides them in dealing with every situation.\n\n
2:1	idm74877					 The father urges his son to seek wisdom. It will protect him from evil men and from the dangers of promiscuous women. The son must seek wisdom, while understanding that it is a gift from God.\n\n
2:1	idm74883					 To **treasure my commands** means to give attention to them and obey them; they allow us to live to the fullest.\n\n
2:2	idm74890					 **wisdom . . . insight . . . understanding:** All three words point toward skills needed to navigate life’s difficulties.\n\n
2:4	idm74897					 Searching for **silver** or **hidden treasures** would be undertaken with urgency, excitement, and anticipation of reward (cp. *Matt 13:44*; *Luke 15:8-10*).\n\n
2:5	idm74907					 The quest for true wisdom leads to God. Wisdom is impossible without fear of the Lord (*1:7*).\n\n
2:6	idm74914					 **The** Lord** grants wisdom** to those who learn it from the Scriptures, which come **from his mouth** (*2 Tim 3:16*; *2 Pet 1:20-21*). It is impossible to become wise through empirical observation alone.\n\n
2:7	idm74926					 Here, **common sense** is intuitive understanding built through listening to God’s words and observing his world. God **is a shield** who **guards** and **protects** those who live in relationship with him.\n\n
2:10	idm74936					 **Wisdom will enter your heart,** becoming an integral part of life. Rather than occasionally doing wise things, the wise person consistently makes wise choices. • **Knowledge** brings **joy** because it helps people live successfully.\n\n
2:12	idm74945					 Wisdom discerns when **words are twisted** to represent what is wrong as being right. The **right way** leads to life, the **wrong** way to death (*1:10-19*; *2:18-19*; *5:5-6*; *9:1-6*, *13-18*). • **dark paths:** In the New Testament, darkness represents the realm of evil, while light represents the realm of God’s goodness (*Matt 4:16*; *5:14-16*; *John 1:14*; *Rom 2:19*).\n\n
2:16	idm74964					 Wisdom keeps a young man from an **immoral woman***,* helping him to resist her flattering, **seductive words**. Wisdom includes emotional maturity, restraint, and the ability to assess the purpose of someone’s speech.\n\n
2:17	idm74973					 By pursuing another man, an immoral woman has **abandoned her husband**. Her marriage **covenant . . . before God** included vows of faithfulness (cp. *Mal 2:14-16*).\n\n
2:18	idm74982					 **leads . . . to** **the grave:** Adultery betrays a fundamental covenant with one’s spouse and with God (see also *Gen 39:2-9*; *Mal 2:14*).\n\n
2:20	idm74992					 Those who make wise choices **will live in the land***;* those who do not will be evicted. God gave the land of Israel to his people, but they could only stay in it if they followed God’s commands (*Deut 28:9-11*, *64-68*). Because they broke his law, they were expelled (in 586 BC; see *2 Kgs 25:1-30*; *2 Chr 36:15-21*).\n\n
3:1	idm75005					 The Lord blesses those who trust him and seek his will. His correction benefits those who follow him.\n\n
3:1	idm75011					 To **store** God’s **commands in your heart** means not just memorizing them but making them an integral part of life and acting on them.\n\n
3:2	idm75019					 Those who obey God’s laws are more likely to **live many years;** wickedness generally has negative physical and psychological consequences. However, evil people sometimes outlive righteous people (*Eccl 7:15-18*).\n\n
3:3	idm75027					 **Loyalty and kindness** reflect the intimate and wholehearted commitment of God’s covenant relationship with his people (see *Deut 6:8-9*). • **Write them:** For a parallel command, see *Prov 7:3*.\n\n
3:5	idm75037					 On the path of wisdom, God himself guides us by the wisdom embodied in his word.\n\n
3:8	idm75043					 **Healing** and **strength** mean enjoying physical vitality as God’s reward for following wisdom’s way.\n\n
3:9	idm75051					 God receives **honor** and blesses his people when they recognize him as the source of all they have and when they give him the **best part of everything** they **produce** (*Gen 4:3-5*; *18:6*; *Num 18:12*, *29*).\n\n
3:11	idm75064					 **The** Lord**’s discipline** can take the form of hardships, disappointments, and frustrations (see *Heb 12:4-6*). Like a good **father***,* God’s purpose is to make us wise, good, and happy.\n\n
3:13	idm75076					 **Wisdom** and **understanding** provide skill for living and handling life’s problems.\n\n
3:14	idm75084					 **Wisdom** is worth more than **precious** metals and jewels. It leads to relationship with God, the ultimate joy-giver (see *2:1-8*).\n\n
3:18	idm75093					 The **tree of life** alludes to the original tree in the Garden of Eden (*Gen 2:9*).\n\n
3:19	idm75101					 God’s **wisdom** created harmony in the universe. Having wisdom means living in conformity with principles embedded in creation.\n\n
3:21	idm75108					 This passage enumerates the benefits of **common sense** and **discernment***,* which are fruits of wisdom.\n\n
3:27	idm75117					 A wise person is a kind and helpful **neighbor**. Proverbs strongly emphasizes helping the financially needy (*11:24*; *28:27*; *29:7*, *14*).\n\n
3:29	idm75128					 Because we have frequent contact with **those who live nearby***,* we must not take advantage of them.\n\n
3:30	idm75136					 While it is impossible to avoid all conflict, we are not to **pick a fight**.\n\n
3:31	idm75143					 The **violent** will ultimately be punished for their ways (*1:18-32*), even if they seem to have an enviable position in the world (*11:16*). The wise will not **envy** them, because they are **detestable to the** Lord. God’s **friendship** is of far greater benefit than anything the violent achieve.\n\n
4:1	idm75156					 Discourses in chs *1–9* often begin with the call to **listen** (cp. *1:8*, *23*; *2:1*; *4:20-21*; *5:1-2*; *6:20-23*; *7:1-3*). • **when your father corrects you:** The children have reason to listen, because they have made mistakes.\n\n
4:2	idm75172					 Wise people navigate life’s difficulties successfully because they have heeded **good guidance.**\n\n
4:3	idm75179					 **my father’s son . . . my mother’s only child:** In Proverbs, both parents give instruction in wisdom. This involvement of both parents is unique among the traditions of the ancient Near East.\n\n
4:4	idm75186					 **my commands:** The words that describe the father’s teaching are used elsewhere in Scripture for God’s law. Fathers represent God to their children; the instruction of wise fathers conforms to God’s law.\n\n
4:5	idm75193					 In the Old Testament, to **forget** means more than not to remember; it is failure to obey.\n\n
4:6	idm75200					 **she:** In Proverbs, **wisdom** is sometimes personified as a woman (see *1:20-33*; *8:1–9:6*).\n\n
4:7	idm75210					 **Wisdom** often, though not always, brings relational and material prosperity.\n\n
4:9	idm75217					 **A lovely wreath** and a **beautiful crown** represent wisdom’s rewards (see also *1:9* and *3:22*).\n\n
4:10	idm75227					 The father again lays two paths before his children, encouraging them to avoid evil with its horrible consequences and to embrace good with its promise of blessing.\n\n
4:10	idm75233					 Not every wise person lives longer than every evil person, but obedience and wise living make **a long, good life** much more likely (see also *5:1-14*, *21-23*; *23:29-35*; cp. *Eccl 2:12-17*).\n\n
4:11	idm75244					 **Wisdom’s . . . paths** are **straight** (nondeceptive), while those of a fool are crooked (*2:15*). • **When you walk . . . run:** The wise reach their goals more quickly and efficiently.\n\n
4:16	idm75254					 The wicked stay up at night to plan evil (*Ps 36:4*; *Mic 2:1*).\n\n
4:17	idm75262					 To **eat . . . wickedness** and **drink . . . violence** means that those attributes are at the very center of someone’s life. Just as we eat and drink to stay alive, evil people sustain themselves by committing evil acts.\n\n
4:18	idm75270					 **Light** stands for wisdom and righteousness, and **darkness** stands for foolishness and wickedness (see *Eccl 2:12-14*). Light brings actions into the open; darkness hides them. Righteous people have nothing to hide, while the wicked try to hide what they do and end up **stumbling over** obstacles in the dark (see *Matt 4:16*; *5:14-16*; *John 1:14*; *Rom 2:19*).\n\n
4:20	idm75284					 The wise walk the path of life with eyes straight ahead.\n\n
4:20	idm75290					 **pay attention:** See also *1:8*, *23*; *2:1*; *5:1-2*; *7:1-3*; *8:1*. The child is to let these teachings transform his personality, represented by his **heart.** A lifelong commitment to follow wisdom requires a change of heart.\n\n
4:22	idm75304					 **Life** and **healing** are rewards for following the wise instructions of the father (see *4:10*).\n\n
4:23	idm75313					 In the Old Testament, the **heart** represents the center of emotions, thinking, and reasoning (e.g., *Gen 6:5*; *Deut 4:29*; *Ps 131:1*). The heart is crucial in the battle between wisdom and foolishness, between righteousness and evil (see *Matt 5:8*; *13:15*; *John 12:40*; *Rom 6:17*).\n\n
4:24	idm75327					 Because a person’s words originate in the heart, Proverbs teaches extensively about speech. One of the most basic lessons is to avoid **perverse** or **corrupt** speech, later defined as lies, slander, gossip, and rumor (*6:12*; *17:4*; *18:8*).\n\n
5:1	idm75338					 These instructions on embracing one’s wife and avoiding immoral women were originally addressed to young men just beginning their professional careers (see also *2:16-22*; *7:1-27*). This topic is also popular in ancient Egyptian wisdom writing.\n\n
5:1	idm75346					 Paying **attention** to instruction results in **discernment**—the ability to tell a right action from a wrong one. These instructions are vitally important when dealing with an immoral woman.\n\n
5:3	idm75354					 The **lips** of the immoral woman seem sweet and enticing but are actually bitter and deadly. Sexual activity often begins with a kiss, and flattering words can entice.\n\n
5:5	idm75361					 A relationship with an immoral woman leads **to death,** as does a relationship with the woman named Folly (see *9:13-18*).\n\n
5:9	idm75369					 An illicit relationship can be tempting, but it eventually brings shame. If the woman is a prostitute, the young man will have to pay her and thus lose income. If the woman is another man’s wife, he might have to pay her husband (see *Lev 20:10*).\n\n
5:11	idm75376					 Some sexually transmitted diseases were well known in the ancient Near East. *Leviticus 15:1-15* describes what is probably gonorrhea; other texts from Mesopotamia describe “the disease of intercourse” and the “disease of Ishtar” (goddess of love) with the physical symptoms of venereal diseases.\n\n
5:15	idm75383					 To **drink** from one’s own **well** (see also *Song 4:12*, *15*) is to enjoy sexual relations within marriage. Rather than expend sexual energy on immoral women, a man should cultivate a healthy sexual relationship with his wife. Sex is not to be shared with **strangers**. This honors marriage (*Gen 2:22-25*) and keeps the seventh commandment (*Exod 20:14* and *Deut 5:18*).\n\n
5:19	idm75397					 **deer:** cp. *Song 4:5*.\n\n
5:21	idm75405					 Even if a man keeps an illicit relationship secret from his family and society, nothing is hidden from **the** Lord. Adultery is a sin against God (*Gen 39:8-9*).\n\n
5:22	idm75414					 Habitual sins are like **ropes that catch and hold** people.\n\n
5:23	idm75421					 **He will die:** Young men must exercise **self-control** because death can result from acting on sexual desire for what is forbidden.\n\n
6:1	idm75429					 To secure the **debt** of another person is to guarantee it with one’s own possessions. Whether to earn a **friend’s** goodwill or to turn a profit from **a stranger** (cp. *Exod 22:25*; *Lev 25:36-37*; *Deut 23:19-20*), the risk is too great to take; it could lead to financial ruin. This message is repeated in *Prov 11:15*; *17:18*; *20:16*; *22:26*; *27:13*.\n\n
6:3	idm75446					 **save yourself:** The danger of ruin is so great that escaping the situation is almost a matter of life and death, as highlighted by the images of animals caught in a trap.\n\n
6:6	idm75453					 Lazy people sleep rather than make necessary provisions (see also *24:33-34*). They are the opposite of self-motivated and industrious **ants**. • **Extra sleep . . . more slumber** sarcastically expresses a lazy person’s ambition.\n\n
6:10	idm75462					 *//*  The result of laziness is **poverty**. It will come suddenly and ruthlessly, **like a bandit** or **an armed robber**.\n\n
6:12	idm75474					 **eye . . . foot . . . fingers . . . hearts:** The different parts of a worthless person’s body describe overall character, not just an occasional foolish act.\n\n
6:13	idm75481					 **wink . . . nudge . . . wiggle:** These behaviors were signals used while trying to deceive the innocent.\n\n
6:15	idm75488					 Even if wicked people seem to prosper, they will **suddenly** be punished.\n\n
6:16	idm75495					 The first line gives a number followed by a second line that increases that number by one. This device (called *number parallelism*) introduces a list of items and often, as here, draws attention to the climactic final item (see also *30:15-23*).\n\n
6:19	idm75503					 A **false witness** perverts the truth in court or in everyday conversation.\n\n
6:20	idm75510					 This passage emphasizes the life-threatening risk of sleeping with another man’s wife (see also *1:8*, *23*; *2:16-22*; *5:1-23*; *7:1-27*).\n\n
6:24	idm75521					 The **immoral woman** uses **smooth** talk and physical **beauty** to appeal to the vanity of young men.\n\n
6:26	idm75530					 Sleeping with a **prostitute** has consequences, and **sleeping with another man’s wife** can **cost you your life**. Her husband will seek revenge (*6:34-35*), and God is watching in judgment.\n\n
6:27	idm75540					 **walk on hot coals:** Of course **his feet** will **blister**. The consequences are horrible.\n\n
6:30	idm75549					 **Seven times** is probably a way of saying *a great amount* since the law never stipulated such high repayment (see *Exod 22:1*, *4*, *9*).\n\n
6:32	idm75560					 A thief might be punished severely even if he had a reason for his actions, but his punishment is nothing compared to an adulterer’s, who has no excuse for his crime. A **jealous husband** will seek the full punishment provided by law, which is death (*Deut 22:22*).\n\n
7:1	idm75568					 This is the last of four sections in chs *1–9* that warn against the dangers of promiscuous women (see also *2:16-22*; *5:1-23*; *6:20-35*).\n\n
7:2	idm75578					 **as you guard your own eyes:** That is, with great care.\n\n
7:3	idm75585					 The Old Testament uses the phrase **tie . . . on your fingers as a reminder** for something that needs to be remembered, most notably God’s commands (*Deut 6:8*; *11:18*). • The NLT’s **write them deep within your heart** reflects the Hebrew idiom *write them on the tablet of your heart* (see also *Prov 3:3*). Only obedience that comes from the heart will last.\n\n
7:4	idm75597					 In Hebrew, **sister** is a term of endearment that expresses intimacy (see *Song 4:9-10*).\n\n
7:5	idm75605					 Loving wisdom will leave no room for a **promiscuous woman***,* whose arsenal includes **flattery** that appeals to a young man’s vanity.\n\n
7:6	idm75614					 The young man’s father tells a story to illustrate his teaching about immoral women.\n\n
7:6	idm75620					 **Naive young men***,* not yet set in their ways, are still open to correction. With each foolish act, they move closer to becoming fools.\n\n
7:9	idm75628					 Foolish actions are often associated with **darkness** (see *4:18-19*; *Eccl 2:13-14*).\n\n
7:10	idm75637					 The woman, **seductively dressed***,* looks good on the outside but inside is full of trouble.\n\n
7:12	idm75645					 Prostitutes commonly solicited business in public areas such as **markets** and at **every corner** of busy **streets** (e.g., *Gen 38:13-16*).\n\n
7:14	idm75655					 The immoral woman’s observance of religious ritual makes her look good on the surface, but her immoral behavior reveals a corrupt heart.\n\n
7:16	idm75661					 Her emphasis on her **bed** and exotic perfumes (**myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon**) is explicitly sexual (cp. *Song 4:13-14*).\n\n
7:18	idm75670					 **let’s drink our fill of love:** cp. *Song 5:1*.\n\n
7:21	idm75678					 The naive young man’s foolish actions might **cost him his life** (see *5:11*; *6:32-35*).\n\n
7:24	idm75687					 The father reasserts the point of his lesson: While an adulteress might look good and a relationship with her is enticing, harm or even death will result.\n\n
8:1	idm75693					 The first part of Proverbs climaxes when the son encounters two women. Both invite the young man, and the reader with him, into an intimate relationship. The young man and the reader must decide between the woman named Wisdom, personifying the true wisdom of God (*8:1–9:6*), and the woman named Folly (*9:13-18*), representing the wisdom of the world (*1 Cor 1:18–2:16*). Both women’s houses are on “the heights overlooking the city” (*Prov 9:3*, *14*), suggesting ancient temples; the choice is thus between the true God and false gods.\n\n
8:1	idm75704					 **Wisdom calls out** openly and publicly, appealing to all and offering them her gift of wisdom. Like a prophet, she wants all to respond to her words.\n\n
8:2	idm75711					 The **hilltop** and **crossroads** provide maximum public access to all who pass by.\n\n
8:3	idm75719					 In ancient Near Eastern cities, the city **gates** had built-in chambers for conducting legal proceedings and business transactions. It was an appropriate place for Wisdom to make her appeal to the most people.\n\n
8:6	idm75726					 Wisdom is associated with **truth***,* **understanding***,* and **knowledge***,* which are **right***,*** wholesome***,*** plain***,* and **clear.** Wisdom detests **deception***,* which is **devious** and **crooked** (cp. *1:2-7*; *6:16-19*).\n\n
8:10	idm75751					 **Choose:** An ethical choice must be made between seeking money or valuables and seeking wisdom, which is far more valuable.\n\n
8:12	idm75758					 **Good judgment, knowledge, and discernment** are only available to those who have **Wisdom**.\n\n
8:13	idm75766					 Those who choose wisdom, i.e., those who **fear the** Lord (see *1:7*; *9:10*), will not speak in ways that harm others or bend the truth.\n\n
8:15	idm75776					 The best **rulers** choose wisdom to guide them (e.g., *1 Kgs 3:16-28*).\n\n
8:22	idm75784					 **formed me from the beginning . . . I was appointed in ages past:** God’s wisdom has always existed. His wisdom is here personified, but wisdom itself is not a person. Wisdom does not exist outside of God; wisdom is an expression of his character and nature. Unlike pagan gods, God needs no outside counselor to give him instructions (see *Isa 40:13-14*). Jesus is the apex of God’s wisdom (see *Col 1:15-17*; *2:3*).\n\n
8:27	idm75794					 God used his wisdom to establish the created order, so wisdom can tell us how the world works and testifies to God’s greatness.\n\n
8:30	idm75800					 **architect:** God’s wisdom guided the shaping of creation, bringing order out of chaos.\n\n
8:32	idm75807					 Wisdom offers great rewards to those who **listen to** and **follow** wisdom.\n\n
8:35	idm75815					 **Life** is the ultimate reward for the wise, while rejecting wisdom results in **death**. These verses point to eternal life and death (see *Luke 23:43*; *1 Cor 15*).\n\n
9:1	idm75825					 The invitation to join **Wisdom** for a lavish meal is met by a competing invitation in *9:13-18*.\n\n
9:1	idm75833					 The number **seven** can denote grandeur or fullness, so the seven **columns** represent the grandeur of Wisdom’s **house***,* the place where it dwells.\n\n
9:2	idm75843					 In the ancient Near East, **a great banquet** would accompany a marriage, a military victory, or the making of a treaty. Wisdom’s celebration marks the beginning of a committed relationship with the hearer.\n\n
9:3	idm75850					 Throughout the ancient Near East, temples were built on **the heights overlooking the city**. A commitment to wisdom involves a commitment to the Lord (contrast *9:14*).\n\n
9:4	idm75858					 Wisdom makes her appeal especially to the **simple** and **those who lack good judgment** because they have not yet decided between wisdom and folly. See *9:16*, where Folly mimics and then perverts Wisdom’s words.\n\n
9:6	idm75867					 Wisdom gives people the ability to navigate life successfully.\n\n
9:7	idm75873					 These verses seem to create an awkward break between the invitations of Wisdom and Folly, but perhaps the purpose is to caution that, in contrast with inviting the simple (*9:4*), inviting **mockers** and **the wicked** is futile at best. Such people have already chosen their path and respond to Wisdom’s advice with violence. By contrast, **the wise** appreciate corrective advice; they welcome it and benefit from it.\n\n
9:10	idm75883					 **Fear of the** Lord**:** See *study note on 1:7*.\n\n
9:13	idm75893					 The woman named Folly also invites the **simple** and **those who lack good judgment** to join her for the banquet she has prepared. Her invitation and advice are antithetical to Wisdom’s (*9:1-6*).\n\n
9:13	idm75902					 **The woman named Folly is brash:** Fools talk boldly and without shame but have nothing intelligent to say.\n\n
9:14	idm75909					 **On the heights overlooking the city** was the traditional location for a temple. Folly personifies false gods and goddesses that compete for the affection and loyalty of God’s people (contrast *9:2-3*).\n\n
9:17	idm75917					 Like Wisdom, Folly has prepared a banquet for her guests (cp. *9:2-5*). However, this meal is dishonest and perverse.\n\n
9:18	idm75924					 Folly’s dinner **guests** end up **in the depths of the grave***,* in contrast to the reward for Wisdom’s *guests* (see *9:6*).\n\n
10:1	idm75935					 This long section is called **The proverbs of Solomon**. It consists mostly of brief bits of advice and observation. These sayings make heavy use of *antithetical parallelism* to contrast wisdom and righteousness with folly and wickedness. The arrangement of these proverbs appears to be essentially random, as in Egyptian and Mesopotamian wisdom literature. Some proverbs are repeated (see *6:10-11* and *24:33-34*; *14:12* and *16:25*; *18:8* and *26:22*; *19:24* and *26:15*; *20:16* and *27:13*; *21:9* and *25:24*; *22:3* and *27:12*). Sometimes a group of proverbs shares a similar theme (e.g., *16:1-11*).\n\n
10:1	idm75958					 The **joy** or **grief** of godly parents reflects the degree of their child’s obedience to principles of wisdom.\n\n
10:2	idm75966					 **Tainted wealth . . . right living:** The book of Proverbs promotes good behavior over having money (see also *11:18*; *13:11*, *22*).\n\n
10:3	idm75976					 This proverb can be misused if outward results are regarded as a barometer of godliness. Job’s three friends, for example, wrongly reasoned that Job must have sinned to earn his suffering (see *Job 22:6-11*).\n\n
10:4	idm75983					 **Lazy people** are foolish, while **hard workers** are wise (see also *10:26*; *26:13-16*).\n\n
10:7	idm75993					 **the name of a wicked person rots away:** In ancient Israel, as is still true today in the Middle East, honor and shame were powerful motivators.\n\n
10:9	idm76000					 **Paths** are a metaphor for life (see *1:15*).\n\n
10:10	idm76008					 To **wink at wrong** suggests approving of bad behavior rather than confronting it. • **but a bold reproof promotes peace:** The NLT translators assume that the original text is reflected in the Greek version. The second line in the Hebrew text may have been copied by mistake from *10:8*.\n\n
10:11	idm76017					 As a **fountain** provides water that sustains life, **the words of the godly** give life to those who hear them. In contrast, the **violent intentions** concealed in **the words of the wicked** bring death (see also *10:6*; *Jas 3:1-12*).\n\n
10:13	idm76029					 **beaten with a rod:** People **lacking sense** will bring harm upon themselves through what they say. Concerning physical discipline, see *23:13-14*.\n\n
10:15	idm76038					 Although **wealth** can be a **fortress** against trouble, money can also create trouble (*13:8*) and can provide false security (*18:10-11*).\n\n
10:17	idm76048					 Wise people are not afraid to have their thinking or behavior corrected—they **accept discipline** as an opportunity to grow in wisdom.\n\n
10:19	idm76055					 Those who talk **too much** show their ignorance and get in trouble (see also *10:17*; *13:3*; *17:28*).\n\n
10:20	idm76065					 **Words** are an expression of the **heart**.\n\n
10:25	idm76073					 **The wicked** might enjoy the material blessings of life, but only temporarily, in contrast with **the godly**. Jesus also expressed this reality (*Matt 7:24-27*).\n\n
10:30	idm76082					 This proverb connects with God’s covenant promises to Israel (see *Deut 28:1-14*, *63-68*). Such connections are rare in the book of Proverbs.\n\n
11:1	idm76090					 Here, honest practices are applied to the business world (see also *16:11*; *20:10*, *23*; *Lev 19:35-37*; *Deut 25:13-15*; *Ezek 45:10*; *Hos 12:7-8*; *Mic 6:11*). • **Scales** were often made of two metal bowls suspended from a crossbar. The unit of currency, the *shekel,* comes from the verb meaning “to weigh” (see *Amos 8:5-6*).\n\n
11:2	idm76107					 **Pride** is dishonest self-promotion, whereas **humility** is an honest assessment of one’s strengths and weaknesses.\n\n
11:4	idm76115					 **Right living***,* which flows from wisdom, is more important than **riches**. Nothing is wrong with *riches* (*10:15*, *22*; *14:24*) that are gained properly (cp. *13:11*; *21:6*; *22:16*).\n\n
11:10	idm76131					 Our actions, whether **godly** or **wicked***,* affect **the whole city** (cp. *Eccl 8:9-13*).\n\n
11:13	idm76142					 This perspective on **a gossip** is repeated in *20:19*.\n\n
11:14	idm76150					 The future of an entire **nation** depends on wisdom.\n\n
11:15	idm76157					 This message is repeated in *6:1-5*; *17:18*; *20:16*; *22:26*; *27:13*.\n\n
11:16	idm76168					 **Respect** is the great and lasting reward of being **gracious***,* while **wealth** is the lesser and temporary prize of being **ruthless** (see also *10:2*; *11:18*).\n\n
11:21	idm76181					 **Godly** behavior has positive consequences for the next generation.\n\n
11:22	idm76188					 **Discretion** is the ability to tell right from wrong, the beautiful from the ugly, and good taste from bad taste.\n\n
11:23	idm76195					 **The wicked** might prosper and **the godly** might suffer in the short term, but the future will right this imbalance.\n\n
11:24	idm76203					 **Generous** people who **give freely** to others **will prosper***,* but those who **hoard** their money will lose it (see *28:27*; *2 Cor 9:6-9*).\n\n
11:28	idm76216					 **Money** can be a blessing from God, but it is uncertain. **The godly** trust in God and **flourish** (see *Ps 1*).\n\n
11:31	idm76226					 The implied answer is that **wicked sinners** will be punished on earth.\n\n
12:4	idm76233					 Elsewhere in Proverbs a **crown** symbolizes wealth (*14:24*), long life (*16:31*), and grandchildren (*17:6*). • **cancer** (literally *rot*): A **disgraceful** wife is a deep and life-threatening problem.\n\n
12:7	idm76246					 **The wicked** might prosper momentarily, but they do not last. **The family of the godly stands firm** for generations.\n\n
12:8	idm76254					 To be **sensible** means to act only after reflecting on the consequences. A **warped mind** acts on impulse.\n\n
12:9	idm76262					 Reality is more important than appearance.\n\n
12:11	idm76268					 This proverb is repeated but with a different conclusion in *28:19*.\n\n
12:12	idm76275					 The instability of **thieves** can produce violent behavior at any moment. By contrast, **the godly are well rooted:** Their relationships are stable even under duress.\n\n
12:15	idm76283					 **Fools** fail to realize what **the wise** know—that listening is the way to learn.\n\n
12:16	idm76291					 Keeping a level head allows a **wise person** to think clearly and avoid reactions that could cause a fight.\n\n
12:17	idm76298					 The message of this proverb is repeated in *14:5*.\n\n
13:1	idm76305					 **A wise child accepts a parent’s discipline:** Gaining wisdom requires *discipline* and **correction**.\n\n
13:3	idm76314					 Having **control** of the **tongue** demonstrates wisdom (see *Jas 3:1-12*).\n\n
13:7	idm76323					 Appearances do not always reflect reality.\n\n
13:8	idm76329					 Money can be a blessing or a curse (see *3:9-10*; *21:6*).\n\n
13:9	idm76337					 **snuffed out:** Cp. *20:20*; *24:20*.\n\n
13:17	idm76346					 Oral messages were the primary form of communication, so an **unreliable messenger** delivering the wrong message could incite all kinds of **trouble**.\n\n
13:20	idm76354					 We are influenced by those we **associate with**.\n\n
13:23	idm76361					 Hard work does not always bring prosperity (cp. *10:4-6*; *12:11*; *13:4*) because **injustice** occurs in the world.\n\n
13:24	idm76371					 Punishment is sometimes necessary to motivate instruction. **Discipline** is a product of **love**, whereas refusal to discipline one’s child is a sign of laziness (see also *19:18*; *23:13-14*; *29:17*).\n\n
14:1	idm76382					 Building or tearing down the **home** is a metaphor for strengthening or weakening one’s family.\n\n
14:2	idm76389					 The **path** is a metaphor for life and conduct (see *2:13*, *20*; *3:6*; *4:11*; *6:23*). • **fear the** Lord**:** See *1:7*.\n\n
14:3	idm76405					 A **fool’s** word can be used against him.\n\n
14:4	idm76412					 It’s easy to keep a **stable . . . clean** if it is empty, but a farmer without an **ox** has no **harvest.**\n\n
14:5	idm76421					 **Honest** speech and **lies** both flow from deep within a person’s character. Cp. *12:17*.\n\n
14:9	idm76430					 **The godly acknowledge** their mistakes and sins, leading to change and **reconciliation.** Fools defend themselves by making **fun of guilt.**\n\n
14:10	idm76439					 No one can fully understand the emotions of another (cp. *Ps 103:14*; *Isa 63:9*; *Nah 1:7*; *Rom 8:27*). **Bitterness** and **joy** are at opposite ends of the emotional spectrum; this poetic device of referring to polar opposites (*merism*) covers the whole range in between.\n\n
14:11	idm76452					 Although a **house** is typically more stable than a **tent***,* wickedness destroys and tears down, while godliness builds up (*14:1*).\n\n
14:12	idm76462					 *//*  The right choice is not always the one that **seems right** on the surface (see *Matt 7:13-14*).\n\n
14:13	idm76473					 A person’s outward demeanor might not reflect what is in the **heart.**\n\n
14:14	idm76480					 **Backsliders** foolishly act against what they know to be good and right and wise.\n\n
14:17	idm76487					 **Short-tempered people** do not anticipate consequences before expressing anger. **Schemers** reflect, but they, too, are **hated** because of the evil that they do.\n\n
14:18	idm76496					 **are clothed with foolishness:** One’s true nature and heart attitude will eventually show in one’s demeanor.\n\n
14:20	idm76503					 This proverb might commend moderation, having neither too little nor too much (*30:7-9*).\n\n
14:21	idm76510					 **blessed are those who help the poor:** See also *3:27-28*; *11:24*; *28:27*; *29:7*, *14*.\n\n
14:24	idm76522					 This proverb states a general principle, even though **fools** sometimes have **wealth** (*10:2*; *11:18*), and poverty is not always the result of **foolishness** (cp. *13:23*; *16:8*).\n\n
14:28	idm76535					 The well-being and growth of the people, not wealth or military victory, are the true signs of a **king’s** success.\n\n
14:29	idm76542					 Wise people can **control** their emotions and express them appropriately.\n\n
14:30	idm76549					 **A peaceful heart** has resolved its inner tensions. Freedom from **jealousy** is beneficial to physical health.\n\n
14:31	idm76557					 Wise people help **the poor** (cp. *11:24-26*; *28:27*; see *Lev 19:9-10*; *Deut 15:11*; *24:10-15*; *Isa 3:14-15*; *Jer 2:34*; see also *Jas 2:1-13*). • **insult their Maker:** See also *Prov 17:5*.\n\n
14:32	idm76574					 Proverbs infrequently hints at life after death. Some scholars think this verse refers to God’s granting courage to face death with dignity and serenity.\n\n
14:34	idm76580					 A great **nation** is not defined by wealth, power, or military victories (*14:28*) but by **godliness**.\n\n
15:1	idm76589					 Moderating emotions and suiting them to the context helps others listen to what we say without reacting.\n\n
15:2	idm76595					 A **wise** teacher presents lessons in an attractive way. Crude belching describes the ugly teaching of a **fool**.\n\n
15:3	idm76603					 Knowing that **thethe eyes of the** Lord** is watching everywhere** is motivation for wise behavior.\n\n
15:5	idm76612					 Wisdom requires learning from **correction**.\n\n
15:6	idm76619					 God blesses the **godly** with wealth (*10:22*; cp. *10:15* and *14:24*). **The wicked** may also gain wealth, but it will bring **trouble** rather than blessing (*11:4*, *18*; *13:11*; *21:6*; *22:16*).\n\n
15:8	idm76636					 God looks beyond the outward actions of **sacrifice** and **prayers** to see if they reflect the heart’s attitude (see also *21:27*; *Ps 40:6-8*; *Mic 6:6-8*).\n\n
15:11	idm76647					 **Death and Destruction** (Hebrew *Sheol and Abaddon*) personify the destiny of the dead. *Sheol* is the abode of the dead; *Abaddon* is a synonym for Sheol that has an added implication of punishment. • God knows all **secrets** (see *Ps 139:1-12*).\n\n
15:12	idm76659					 **Mockers** cannot become **wise** because they keep criticism at a distance (cp. *10:17*; *13:1*, *10*).\n\n
15:13	idm76670					 What people feel affects how they present themselves (cp. *15:30*).\n\n
15:14	idm76677					 Whether we enjoy **knowledge** or **trash** reveals whether we are on the path of wisdom or of folly.\n\n
15:15	idm76685					 Personality affects our outlook on life.\n\n
15:16	idm76691					 A healthy **fear for the** Lord counteracts **inner turmoil** and brings inner peace. • **Better to have little:** See also *16:8*.\n\n
15:17	idm76702					 This **better than** proverb shows the relative value of wealth. A substantial meal (**steak**) is good, but **love** is better.\n\n
15:18	idm76711					 Controlling one’s anger is a sign of wisdom (see also *Jas 1:19-20*).\n\n
15:19	idm76718					 A **lazy person** can find all kinds of obstacles (e.g., a path **blocked with briers**) to avoid work (see *10:4*, *26*; *12:11*, *14*; *13:4*; *14:4*).\n\n
15:22	idm76732					 An individual might not think of all the angles of a problem; a wise person invites **advice** from **many advisers**.\n\n
15:24	idm76740					 A wise person avoids death by choosing **the path of life**.\n\n
15:25	idm76747					 The **proud** think that they are self-sufficient. **Widows** in the ancient Near East were just the opposite—completely vulnerable and without means of support or protection.\n\n
15:29	idm76755					 The heart behind **prayers** determines whether God hears them.\n\n
15:30	idm76762					 Just as how we feel affects our demeanor (see *15:13*), what we experience (such as another person’s **cheerful look** or **good news**) can affect how we feel.\n\n
15:33	idm76771					 **Fear of the** Lord fosters **humility** because proper regard for God counteracts our delusions of self-sufficiency.\n\n
16:1	idm76780					 **Our own plans** will come to fruition only if God allows (see also *16:9*, *33*; *Jas 4:13-16*).\n\n
16:2	idm76790					 God’s moral evaluation is what counts (see *Gen 8:21*; *1 Sam 13:14*; *16:6-7*; *Luke 16:15*). This proverb is repeated almost verbatim in *Prov 21:2*.\n\n
16:3	idm76801					 God must affirm our **plans** (*16:1*), so it makes sense to ask his help in accomplishing our goals (see *Jas 4:13-16*).\n\n
16:4	idm76810					 **The wicked** will have trouble in this life and in death. Nothing is outside of God’s control (see also *Rom 9:10-24*; *2 Pet 2:9*).\n\n
16:5	idm76819					 God **detests the proud***,* who refuse to commit their ways to the Lord (*16:3*) and mistakenly believe that they can accomplish their plans on their own (*16:1*).\n\n
16:6	idm76829					 God’s **unfailing love and faithfulness** are foundational in his covenant relationship with Israel (see *Exod 15:13*; *34:6-7*; *Num 14:18-19*; *Deut 7:9-11*).\n\n
16:8	idm76840					 **Better to have little:** See also *15:16*.\n\n
16:10	idm76848					 This series of sayings reflects on **the king***,* who represents God’s power on earth.\n\n
16:10	idm76856					 **Divine wisdom** refers to divinely inspired guidance that helps the king make judgments (e.g., *1 Kgs 3:28*; see also *Ps 72:2*).\n\n
16:11	idm76865					 The message of this proverb is stated four times in the collection (cp. *11:1*; *20:10*, *23*).\n\n
16:12	idm76874					 These proverbs presuppose a wise, godly **king** (see *Isa 9:6-7*). Many of Israel’s kings loved wrongdoing and hated truth (e.g., Ahab in *1 Kgs 21*).\n\n
16:14	idm76883					 The **king** is powerful, so people are wise to avoid his **anger** and gain his **favor**.\n\n
16:16	idm76892					 **Wisdom** and **good judgment** may lead to wealth, but wealth cannot buy wisdom.\n\n
16:18	idm76900					 The **pride** of those who resist God and stubbornly rely on their own strength (*16:5*) is self-destructive and foolish because, apart from God’s help, no one has the resources required for life.\n\n
16:25	idm76908					 This proverb repeats *14:12*.\n\n
16:27	idm76915					 **Scoundrels***,* **a troublemaker***,* and **violent people** all disrupt relationships, creating **trouble** with their **harmful** actions.\n\n
16:31	idm76928					 **Godly** people grow in wisdom as they grow older, so their **gray hair is a crown** (cp. *4:9*; *12:4*; *17:6*).\n\n
16:32	idm76939					 Patience and **self-control** are far more valuable than brute force.\n\n
16:33	idm76946					 **We may throw the dice:** These dice were not for gambling but were a means commissioned by God to determine his will (*Exod 28:30*; see also *Josh 14:2*; *1 Sam 10:17-27*; *14:40-43*).\n\n
17:2	idm76957					 Wisdom is so much more important than privilege that if children act like fools, a **wise servant** will rise to prominence over the household.\n\n
17:3	idm76964					 The Lord’s refining **fire** (see *Ps 66:10*; *Jer 9:7*; *Mal 3:2-3*) separates what is precious from the impurities in a person’s **heart** (cp. *Prov 16:2*; *21:2*; *27:21*).\n\n
17:4	idm76978					 Lies (*6:16-19*; *14:5*, *25*; *25:18*), **gossip** (*11:13*; *18:8*), and **slander** (*10:18*) distort reality for malicious purposes.\n\n
17:5	idm76993					 To make fun of what God created is to mock God.\n\n
17:6	idm76999					 Only those who have been blessed with a long life live to become grandparents, and the continuation of the family line is a sign of God’s blessing (see *Gen 12:1-3*). • **parents:** Literally *fathers.* This proverb applies to both fathers and mothers.\n\n
17:9	idm77008					 Maintaining a good relationship with another person means forgiving rather than dwelling on faults.\n\n
17:10	idm77014					 The wise will listen to a mild **rebuke** and act on good advice. Even harsh correction (**a hundred lashes**) will not change a fool.\n\n
17:11	idm77022					 **Rebellion** flows from the inner character of **evil people** who defy the punishment that will follow.\n\n
17:12	idm77030					 This saying cautions those who try to teach fools. **A fool caught in foolishness** will react with anger and violence.\n\n
17:14	idm77037					 **opening a floodgate:** Once a quarrel starts, it is very difficult to stop it; **a dispute** should be avoided if at all possible (see *10:12*; *15:18*; *16:28*; *20:3*; *22:10*; *26:21*).\n\n
17:18	idm77051					 The essence of this message is repeated in *6:1-5*; *11:15*; *20:16*; *22:26*; *27:13*.\n\n
17:19	idm77062					 **high walls:** Foolish confidence in the ability to win a fight emboldens people to engage in disastrous arguments.\n\n
17:24	idm77069					 Wisdom is not a natural quality but must be pursued. **Sensible people** persistently cultivate wisdom, but **a fool’s eyes** cannot stay focused.\n\n
17:25	idm77077					 **Foolish children:** This proverb is equally true of sons and daughters.\n\n
18:4	idm77084					 Words flow from one’s character as water bubbles up from the earth (see also *10:20*; *12:23*; *16:23*; cp. *Jas 3:10-12*).\n\n
18:8	idm77094					 *//*  **Rumors** may be delicious to hear and repeat, but they are deadly.\n\n
18:10	idm77104					 In a troubled world, only **the** Lord can save. The rich might believe **their wealth** is **a strong defense***,* but the power of money is limited (*11:4*; *13:8*).\n\n
18:12	idm77117					 **Haughtiness** cultivates pride. It leads to failure because it does not allow for change in the face of criticism. **Humility** learns from others and leads to the **honor** of success.\n\n
18:14	idm77126					 A spiritual or emotional problem (**a crushed spirit**) can be more trying than a physical one (**sick body**).\n\n
18:16	idm77134					 See “*Bribes*” Theme Note.\n\n
18:17	idm77141					 It is important to hear both sides of a dispute. Only fools jump to conclusions and rush to judgment; the wise take time to discern.\n\n
18:18	idm77147					 **Flipping a coin** (literally *Casting lots*): Casting lots was a valid way of seeking God’s will (*Num 27:21*; *Josh 18:6-10*). The Lord determined how the lots would fall (*Prov 16:33*).\n\n
18:21	idm77158					 **Life** and **death***:* The wise speak thoughtfully (*10:19*; *11:12*; *12:23*) because they know that what we say has **consequences** (*13:3*; *14:3*).\n\n
18:23	idm77173					 God will punish the powerful who disparage **the poor***;* wise people care for the needy (*11:24*; *28:27*; *29:7*, *14*).\n\n
18:24	idm77185					 Some people who present themselves as **“friends”** are not. The wise see beyond pretense, discerning **a real friend** from false friends by how they act in adverse circumstances.\n\n
19:1	idm77193					 It is **better to be . . . honest***,* though **poor***,* because wealth gained by **dishonest** means is short-lived (*10:2*) and will not preserve one from harm (*11:4*; see also *15:16-17*; *16:8*, *16*; *17:1*; *22:1*; *28:6*).\n\n
19:2	idm77212					 Rushing into things without understanding is dangerous.\n\n
19:3	idm77218					 Rather than acknowledge wrong choices and actions, fools blame **the** Lord.\n\n
19:5	idm77226					 God will make sure that liars are punished (see *12:17*, *19*; *14:5*, *25*; *19:9*).\n\n
19:8	idm77237					 It is in our self-interest **to acquire wisdom** because **understanding** helps us **prosper**.\n\n
19:9	idm77246					 The reference to a **false witness** (see also *19:5*) reminds us of the ninth commandment (*Exod 20:16*).\n\n
19:12	idm77255					 A **lion’s roar** is a frightening prelude to life-threatening violence (cp. *20:2*). **Dew on the grass** is soothing and contributes to growth (see *16:14-15*).\n\n
19:13	idm77265					 No choice for a son is more important than a good wife (cp. *31:10-31*); a poor choice brings agony (see *10:1*; *11:22*; *12:4*; *21:9*, *19*; *25:24*; *27:15-17*). The wise man will look to **the** Lord to **give an understanding wife**.\n\n
19:16	idm77282					 Keeping God’s **commandments** (i.e., the law of Moses) protects one’s **life** (see *Deut 28:15-68*).\n\n
19:18	idm77291					 Growing in wisdom requires **discipline** for everyone, including **children** (see *10:17*; *13:1*, *10*; *15:31-32*; *17:10*). The temporary grief that accompanies discipline is worth the protection from **ruin**.\n\n
19:24	idm77305					 *//*  This proverb is a humorous comment on the foolishness of being **lazy** (see also *10:4-6*, *26*; *12:11*, *27*; *13:4*; *15:19*; *18:9*).\n\n
19:25	idm77322					 **A mocker** is beyond help (see study notes on *1:22*; *21:11*). A leader should still **punish** him because **the simpleminded will learn a lesson**.\n\n
19:26	idm77333					 See *Exod 20:12*; *21:15*, *17*.\n\n
20:1	idm77342					 Too much **alcohol** clouds a person’s judgment. The Old Testament is not against drinking **wine** in moderation (*3:10*; *9:5*; *Ps 104:14-15*), but it adamantly opposes excessive drinking (*Prov 21:17*; *23:29-35*; *31:4-5*).\n\n
20:2	idm77356					 Queen Esther was willing to **rouse** the king’s **anger** and **risk** her **life** (*Esth 7*).\n\n
20:6	idm77367					 True **friends** are **reliable** even in difficulties.\n\n
20:8	idm77375					 The **king** should be the epitome of wisdom and justice.\n\n
20:9	idm77382					 Wise people recognize their own weaknesses. Pride prohibits people from seeing their faults (*6:17-18*; *11:2*; *13:10*; *15:33*; *16:18*; *18:12*; see also *1 Jn 1:8-10*).\n\n
20:10	idm77395					 **False weights and unequal measures:** Merchants, for example, should not cheat their customers by using false weights to weigh out grain (cp. *11:1*; *16:11*; *20:23*).\n\n
20:12	idm77405					 The ability to observe and learn from experience is a divine gift.\n\n
20:13	idm77411					 Laziness generally leads to **poverty** (see *10:4-6*, *26*; *12:11*; *13:4*; *14:4*; *15:19*; *18:9*; *19:15*, *24*; *20:4*).\n\n
20:14	idm77428					 Sellers must see past a buyer’s words to avoid being cheated.\n\n
20:16	idm77434					 *//*  A wise lender gets **security** or **a deposit** on a loan. A **stranger** was an Israelite unknown to a lender, who required security. Proverbs warns the wise to avoid borrowing altogether (see *6:1-2*). • The message of this proverb is repeated in *6:1-5*; *11:15*; *17:18*; *22:26*.\n\n
20:19	idm77451					 This perspective on the **gossip** is repeated in *11:13*.\n\n
20:21	idm77459					 An **inheritance** gained **early in life** is likely to be spent long before death, leaving nothing to live on.\n\n
20:22	idm77467					 See also *Rom 12:17-21*.\n\n
20:23	idm77474					 The message of this proverb is presented in three other proverbs (cp. *11:1*; *16:11*; *20:10*).\n\n
20:24	idm77483					 God’s role in guiding **our steps** is clear (see *16:1*, *9*, *33*). We do not need to **understand** why things happen, but we should not lose hope, for God is in control.\n\n
20:25	idm77494					 **Counting the cost** is particularly important when making a **promise to God** (see *Judg 11:29-40*; *Eccl 5:4-6*).\n\n
20:26	idm77504					 A **king** represents God on earth, so he should support the godly and punish **the wicked**.\n\n
20:27	idm77512					 **The** Lord**’s light penetrates the human spirit:** God sees deep into people’s hearts (see *16:2*).\n\n
20:28	idm77522					 God’s **unfailing love** and **faithfulness** are closely connected to his covenant with his people (see *Exod 34:5-7*; *Deut 7:7-9*). The king represents God on earth, so God will **protect** him (see *2 Sam 7*).\n\n
20:30	idm77534					 **Physical punishment cleanses away evil:** See *13:24*; *22:15*; *23:13-14*.\n\n
21:1	idm77544					 A **king** was the most powerful individual in an ancient nation, and it seemed that he could do as he pleased. However, God directs the **heart** of the king.\n\n
21:2	idm77552					 This proverb is repeated almost verbatim in *16:2*.\n\n
21:3	idm77559					 God is not **pleased** with worship unless godly actions flow from a godly heart (see *Ps 40:6-8*; *Mic 6:6-8*).\n\n
21:4	idm77568					 Demeanor (**eyes**), character (**heart**), and **actions** are all significant. God hates pride (see *6:17-18*; *11:2*; *13:10*; *15:33*; *16:18*; *18:12*).\n\n
21:8	idm77583					 The **crooked path** of foolishness ends with death; the **straight road** of wisdom leads to life.\n\n
21:9	idm77591					 *//*  A marriage that looks good on the outside (**in a lovely home**) is unrewarding if it is filled with quarrels (see also *21:19*; *25:24*; *27:15-17*; cp. *11:22*; *12:4b*).\n\n
21:10	idm77606					 **Evil people** do not just act evil; they are evil. No appeal will persuade them to act otherwise.\n\n
21:11	idm77613					 The **simpleminded** learn by seeing **a mocker** punished (see *1:22*; *19:25*). **The wise** do not need the threat of punishment because they already desire wisdom.\n\n
21:12	idm77624					 **The Righteous One:** God sees what **the wicked** do in the privacy of their **homes** and will punish them for their sins. Alternatively, *the Righteous One* might refer to the insight of any righteous individual.\n\n
21:15	idm77634					 God is just, so he will reward the innocent and punish the wicked. No wonder **the godly** love justice while the wicked fear it.\n\n
21:16	idm77641					 Those who have **common sense** can avoid life’s dangers.\n\n
21:17	idm77648					 The expenses of **wine and luxury** prevent people from amassing their resources—they spend rather than save.\n\n
21:18	idm77655					 **The wicked** will fall prey to the traps they set for others (*26:27*; see also *11:8*).\n\n
21:19	idm77664					 **It’s better to live alone:** Cp. *21:9*; *25:24*.\n\n
21:20	idm77673					 See also *3:9-10*, *15-16*; *10:15*, *16*, *22*; *14:24*.\n\n
21:21	idm77685					 **Righteousness** and **unfailing love** are character traits associated with Israel’s covenant with God (see *Exod 34:5-7*; *Deut 7:9-11*). The covenant promised **life** and **honor** to those who obeyed God’s law (*Deut 28:1-14*).\n\n
21:22	idm77698					 A **wise** military strategist can devise ways to defeat stronger forces. This makes wisdom superior to raw power (cp. *Eccl 7:12*; *9:13-18*).\n\n
21:24	idm77707					 **Mockers:** See *1:25-27*; *9:7-9*. Also see *study note on 1:22*.\n\n
21:26	idm77717					 Generosity is a trait of **the godly**, while stinginess is characteristic of fools (*29:7*, *14*). Paradoxically, the more you give, the more you get (*11:24*).\n\n
21:30	idm77727					 **Human wisdom** is impotent if it stands **against the** Lord (see *16:1*, *3*, *9*, *33*). Similarly, military power (represented by **the horse**) is impotent without the Lord’s blessing.\n\n
22:1	idm77741					 A wise person will never compromise his reputation in pursuit of money.\n\n
22:2	idm77747					 Remembering that **the** Lord** made them both** helps prevent the exploitation of the **poor**. \n\n
22:3	idm77757					 *//*  The theme of taking **precautions** is found in several proverbs (*14:8*, *15*; *21:29*).\n\n
22:4	idm77770					 **Fear of the** Lord (see *1:7*; *9:10*) goes hand in hand with **humility.** A humble person knows that he is not the center of the universe. Humility is more valuable than wealth (*16:19*; see also *11:2*; *15:33*; *18:12*).\n\n
22:5	idm77785					 Living by deceit is dangerous; **corrupt people** never know when their treachery will be discovered or backfire.\n\n
22:7	idm77792					 This is a warning against being a **borrower***;* other proverbs warn against guaranteeing others’ debts (*6:1-2*; *20:16*).\n\n
22:11	idm77802					 Even a wicked ruler wants advisers who have a **pure heart**—i.e., who are completely loyal—and who can communicate with **gracious speech.**\n\n
22:12	idm77810					 This proverb reminds the wise (**those with knowledge**) that **the** Lord is in control.\n\n
22:13	idm77819					 Of the many proverbs on laziness (*10:4-6*, *26*; *12:11*; *13:4*; *14:4*; *15:19*; *18:9*; *19:15*, *24*; *20:4*, *13*; *21:25*; *26:13*), this is among the funniest. Lazy people will come up with any outlandish excuse for not working.\n\n
22:14	idm77838					 **An immoral woman**, using flattery and seduction, tries to **trap** a young man to commit sin.\n\n
22:15	idm77846					 Wisdom is learned, not inherited or innate. It takes **discipline** to change **foolishness** into wisdom.\n\n
22:16	idm77854					 **A person . . . gets ahead** by hard work, not by exploiting the poor or bribing **the rich** (cp. *22:29*).\n\n
22:17	idm77863					 This section is ascribed to a group called **the wise**. Who they were is unknown. There is a reference to **thirty sayings** (*22:20*), and the wisdom sayings that follow can be divided into thirty sections that are similar to an Egyptian composition called the *Instruction of Amenemope,* which is also divided into thirty chapters.\n\n
22:17	idm77873					 As with the prologue that opens the book of Proverbs (*1:2-7*) and the introductions to the individual discourses (see *1:8-9*; *2:1-11*), this section begins with an encouragement to **listen**. This wisdom is more than good practical advice—its purpose is to inspire **trust in the** Lord.\n\n
22:20	idm77885					 **thirty sayings:** Early scribes noticed that the Hebrew word for *thirty* has been written in an unusual form (*shlshwm*) rather than the usual form (*shlyshym*). All the early translations of the Old Testament (e.g., Greek Septuagint, Latin Vulgate, Syriac Peshitta) read it as **thirty**. Nonetheless, some prefer to translate the word as *excellent sayings.*\n\n
22:22	idm77897					 Saying 1: God defends the weak, including the **poor**. Those who are well off are responsible to be generous to the poor (*11:24-26*; *21:13*; *22:9*, *16*; *28:27*).\n\n
22:24	idm77909					 Saying 2: An **angry . . . hot-tempered** person is unable to control his emotions and expresses his anger at inappropriate times.\n\n
22:26	idm77916					 Saying 3: The message of this proverb is repeated in *6:1-5*; *11:15*; *17:18*; *20:16*; *27:13*.\n\n
22:28	idm77927					 Saying 4: Property was marked by stones set up as **boundary markers;** it was a great offense to move these ancient markers of real estate (see also *23:10*; *Deut 19:14*).\n\n
22:29	idm77936					 Saying 5: Those who hone their skills and work hard will have the best jobs and work for the best people.\n\n
23:1	idm77942					 Saying 6: Many proverbs address young men in government service. A ruler’s rich fare might tempt a novice to overindulge through lack of self-control. But he will be vulnerable when sated.\n\n
23:4	idm77948					 Saying 7: Riches can be God’s blessing (*3:9-10*, *15-16*; *10:22*), but there are other things in life that are more important.\n\n
23:6	idm77957					 Saying 8: Proverbs puts a high premium on generosity (*11:24-26*; *21:13*; *22:9*).\n\n
23:9	idm77966					 Saying 9: **Fools** ignore **advice** (cp. *9:7-12*; *10:18*), so the wise do not **waste** their **breath** (see *Matt 7:6*).\n\n
23:10	idm77979					 Saying 10: The wise avoid unfair business practices and illegitimate gains (see *22:28*), knowing that the Lord will judge wrongdoing. • **Redeemer:** The NLT is probably correct in capitalizing the word *Redeemer* and identifying him with God, although a human redeemer might be intended.\n\n
23:12	idm77988					 Saying 11: **listen carefully:** Learning is the way to improve (see *10:17*; *13:1*, *10*; *15:24*, *31-32*; *17:10*; *19:24*).\n\n
23:13	idm78002					 Saying 12: See *19:18*; *29:17*.\n\n
23:15	idm78010					 Saying 13: A wise parent **will rejoice** in a wise child (see *10:1*).\n\n
23:17	idm78018					 Saying 14: Sometimes **sinners** prosper, but the wise will see that **to fear the** Lord is what ultimately rewards (see *1:7*).\n\n
23:19	idm78028					 Saying 15: Discipline is necessary for living a wise and balanced life. Overindulgence in drink (**drunkards***,* see also *23:29-35*), food (**gluttons***,* see also *23:1-3*), or **sleep** (see also *10:5*; *19:15*) results in **poverty**.\n\n
23:22	idm78044					 Saying 16: This saying is an exhortation to pursue the wisdom that a godly **father** and **mother** provide. Unlike other ancient Near East wisdom texts, Proverbs attributes wisdom to both father and mother (*1:8*; *6:20*).\n\n
23:26	idm78054					 Saying 17: Falling for a **promiscuous woman** is a **trap***,* not a source of benefit. Proverbs repeatedly emphasizes avoiding sexual relations outside of marriage (see ch *5*; *6:20-35*; *7:1-27*).\n\n
23:29	idm78066					 Saying 18: This extended saying portrays the foolishness of the person who overindulges in alcohol (see *20:1*).\n\n
24:1	idm78073					 Saying 19: See *1:8-19*.\n\n
24:3	idm78080					 Saying 20: See *14:11*.\n\n
24:5	idm78087					 Saying 21: See *21:22*.\n\n
24:7	idm78094					 Saying 22: Rulers should be wise (see *8:5-6*).\n\n
24:8	idm78101					 Saying 23: Fools are alienated from the community because of their evil actions.\n\n
24:10	idm78107					 Saying 24: A wise person has self-control and strength **under pressure** (e.g., *Dan 1:8-16*; *3:1-18*).\n\n
24:11	idm78116					 Saying 25: The wise do what they can to prevent injustice and suffering (e.g., *Job 29:12-17*).\n\n
24:13	idm78123					 Saying 26: Both **honey** and **wisdom** are sweet. Wisdom improves the **soul***,* enhancing opportunities for the **future**.\n\n
24:15	idm78134					 Saying 27: Those who are godly will not allow a setback to keep them down. • **Seven times** is symbolic for “many times.”\n\n
24:17	idm78141					 Saying 28: This saying leads to Jesus’ call to love our **enemies** (*Matt 5:43-48*).\n\n
24:19	idm78149					 Saying 29: **Don’t envy** the apparent prosperity of **the wicked** (see *24:1-2*), because their success is fleeting. • **snuffed out:** Cp. *13:9*; *20:20*.\n\n
24:21	idm78161					 Saying 30: **The king** is associated with **the** Lord*,* reflecting his power and sovereignty on the earth (see *1 Sam 12*; *Ps 2*).\n\n
24:23	idm78173					 This addendum to the thirty sayings **of the wise** (*22:17–24:22*) includes five **further sayings**.\n\n
24:23	idm78182					 Saying 1: Truthfulness in rendering **judgment** is a hallmark of wisdom (see *6:19*; *12:17*; *19:28*; *24:28-29*; *25:18*).\n\n
24:26	idm78194					 Saying 2: A true friend does not cover up problems but honestly points out areas for improvement. A wise person welcomes the correction of a friend.\n\n
24:27	idm78200					 Saying 3: A wise person establishes a source of income before spending money on himself.\n\n
24:28	idm78206					 Saying 4: The truth should not be bent, not even for revenge (see *6:19*; *12:17*; *14:25*; *19:28*; *24:23-24*; *25:18*).\n\n
24:30	idm78218					 Saying 5: Laziness and love for **sleep** lead to **poverty** (see *10:4-5*, *26*; *12:11*; *13:4*; *15:19*; *18:9*; *19:15*, *24*; *20:4*, *13*).\n\n
24:33	idm78236					 This proverb repeats *6:10-11*.\n\n
25:1	idm78243					 During the reign of **King Hezekiah** (728–686 BC), wise men (**advisers**) collected these **proverbs of Solomon** and added them to the collection.\n\n
25:2	idm78253					 This warning reminds young men entering royal service that some things cannot be understood, including the king’s sometimes mysterious reasoning (e.g., *2 Sam 11:14-25*; *24:3*).\n\n
25:4	idm78261					 As **silver** is ready for use once it is refined of impurities, **the king’s court** can do **justice** when **wicked** people are removed. A little bit of evil can spoil much good (*Eccl 10:1*).\n\n
25:6	idm78272					 To gain **an audience with the king***,* a wise person will practice humility instead of pride (cp. *Matt 20:20-28*).\n\n
25:7	idm78281					 Rash actions often result in shame.\n\n
25:9	idm78287					 See *11:13*; *20:19*.\n\n
25:11	idm78295					 **Timely advice** and **valid criticism** are precious, beautiful, and rare (see also *15:23*; *26:7*, *9*), and should be welcomed (see *10:17*; *13:1*, *10*; *15:24*, *31-32*; *17:10*).\n\n
25:13	idm78312					 **Snow** would be a welcome relief in Israel’s hot, dry summers (cp. *26:1*); **trustworthy messengers** refresh **their employer** by enabling him or her to plan for the future.\n\n
25:14	idm78322					 In Israel, **rain** is rare. When rain does not follow the appearance of storm **clouds***,* it is like the disappointment caused by someone who gives empty **promises**. Cp. Jude’s description of false teachers (*Jude 1:12*).\n\n
25:16	idm78333					 **Honey** in moderation is tasty and healthy (*24:13-14*); **too much** will cause vomiting. This principle can be applied to other areas of life; for example, it is good to **visit your neighbors***,* but not **too often**.\n\n
25:18	idm78345					 Lying can have deadly consequences (see *6:16-19*; *14:5*, *25*).\n\n
25:21	idm78354					 Contrary to expectation, compassion toward an enemy is more effective than anger (see *Rom 12:20*).\n\n
25:24	idm78361					 This proverb repeats *21:9*.\n\n
25:26	idm78368					 A **spring** or **fountain** that yields fresh water gives life. When **godly** people allow **the wicked** to dominate them, what was life-giving becomes deadly.\n\n
25:27	idm78378					 The wise have self-control and cannot easily be dominated.\n\n
26:1	idm78384					 It is not fitting to give **honor** to **fools**.\n\n
26:2	idm78392					 Curses and blessings can have real effect (see *Gen 27:1-41*; *48:8-9*, *15-20*; *Num 6:23-27*), but an **undeserved curse** has no effect.\n\n
26:3	idm78403					 A **fool** is like a dumb animal that can only be guided by brute force (see *10:13*; *14:3*).\n\n
26:4	idm78412					 Proverbs are often context sensitive. Whether or not to **answer the foolish arguments of fools** depends on what kind of fool and what kind of situation.\n\n
26:7	idm78419					 A **fool** might know a **proverb** but not be able to use it correctly. Cp. *26:9*.\n\n
26:9	idm78428					 A **proverb** misapplied by **a fool** might actually cause harm. Cp. *26:7*.\n\n
26:10	idm78437					 **A fool or a bystander** might easily be lazy (see *10:4-6*) or incompetent (see *26:6-7*). **An employer** should beware!\n\n
26:11	idm78447					 Even when **foolishness** brings terrible consequences, **a fool** persists in it (*17:10*; see also *2 Pet 2:22*).\n\n
26:12	idm78457					 **Fools** have **hope** because they might recognize their folly and seek advice. However, those **who think they are wise** will remain ignorant.\n\n
26:13	idm78466					 **The lazy person:** See *6:6-11*; *10:4-5*; *15:19*; *22:13*.\n\n
26:15	idm78477					 This proverb repeats *19:24*.\n\n
26:17	idm78484					 The wise avoid getting involved in other people’s arguments (cp. *26:21*).\n\n
26:18	idm78491					 Lies are extremely dangerous because they lead people to act on false information. Liars cannot cover up later by claiming that they were **only joking** (see *6:16-19*; *14:5*, *25*; *25:18*).\n\n
26:20	idm78502					 A **gossip** and a **quarrelsome person** are both like fuel to the **fire** of trouble and discord.\n\n
26:22	idm78511					 This proverb repeats *18:8*.\n\n
26:23	idm78518					 People sometimes hide evil attitudes and wicked intentions through flattery. In the end, the true **hatred** of smooth talkers will **be exposed**.\n\n
26:27	idm78526					 People usually receive the bad consequences they intend for others (see *1:17-19*).\n\n
27:1	idm78533					 We should plan (*24:27*), but our plans succeed only when God so wills (*16:1*, *3*, *33*; *Jas 4:13-16*). Only fools think that they control the future.\n\n
27:2	idm78544					 The Hebrew word translated **praise** comes from the same root as “brag” in *27:1*. Bragging (self-praise) is foolish.\n\n
27:3	idm78552					 Fools cause **heavy . . . resentment** by their foolish words and actions.\n\n
27:4	idm78559					 **Anger** can be dangerous but can be countered with a gentle answer (*15:1*). **Jealousy** is harder to resolve (*6:34-35*).\n\n
27:5	idm78569					 A **rebuke** improves life by correcting harmful behavior (*13:1*; *14:6*). **Hidden***,* unexpressed **love** has no value.\n\n
27:6	idm78581					 **Wounds from a . . . friend** are from a loving rebuke (*27:5*). They are **better than** flattery (**many kisses**) from an enemy who intends to harm rather than help.\n\n
27:7	idm78591					 Even the best teaching (**honey**) will be refused if offered at the wrong time. The key to real learning is the receptivity of the student.\n\n
27:8	idm78598					 **A person who** forsakes his family and **strays from home** will more likely find trouble than whatever he was seeking (e.g., *Luke 15:11-16*).\n\n
27:9	idm78607					 Nothing is more encouraging than **heartfelt counsel** from an intimate **friend** (see also *27:6*).\n\n
27:10	idm78616					 In a crisis, one might need immediate assistance, so it is important to have friends close by and neighbors who can help.\n\n
27:11	idm78622					 Fairly or not, parents are evaluated by their children’s public behavior.\n\n
27:12	idm78628					 This proverb repeats *22:3*.\n\n
27:13	idm78635					 This proverb repeats *20:16*.\n\n
27:14	idm78642					 It is important to speak appropriately for the circumstances (cp. *15:23*).\n\n
27:15	idm78649					 **A quarrelsome wife:** Cp. *19:13*; *21:9*, *19*; *25:24*.\n\n
27:17	idm78660					 **iron sharpens iron:** Wisdom comes from interaction, often critical, with a good **friend** (see *27:6*, *9*).\n\n
27:18	idm78670					 An employer values loyal **workers** who **protect their employer’s interests**. Wise employers give their workers incentives to be loyal, such as allowing them to **eat the fruit** (see *Deut 25:4*; *1 Cor 9:7-10*; *1 Tim 5:17-18*).\n\n
27:20	idm78682					 **Death and Destruction:** See *study note on 15:11*. • **Human desire is never satisfied** by money, power, or pleasure.\n\n
27:21	idm78691					 **A person** who avoids conceit in response to praise demonstrates **purity** of character (cp. *17:3*).\n\n
27:22	idm78700					 **Foolishness** is deeply ingrained in the character of a fool.\n\n
27:23	idm78707					 Agricultural property can provide food and clothing from generation to generation; these resources require continuous labor and attention or, like **riches***,* they disappear.\n\n
28:1	idm78715					 **The wicked** experience God’s curse for breaking his covenant (see *Lev 26:14-17*, *36-37*).\n\n
28:2	idm78724					 **Wise . . . leaders** rule justly and effectively (*8:15-16*).\n\n
28:4	idm78732					 Without **law***,* chaos results and the wicked flourish.\n\n
28:5	idm78740					 **Evil people** seek gain by breaking the law. **Justice** ensures that they are punished and the righteous are rewarded.\n\n
28:6	idm78748					 Virtue is more valuable than material wealth. This proverb is repeated with a slightly different conclusion in *19:1*.\n\n
28:7	idm78755					 **their parents:** This proverb applies to both fathers and mothers.\n\n
28:8	idm78762					 The law prohibited charging needy Israelites interest on loans (*Exod 22:25*; *Lev 25:36*; *Deut 23:19*). The rich were instructed to lend generously to the poor (*Prov 3:27-28*; *11:24*; *28:27*; *29:7*, *14*).\n\n
28:9	idm78776					 **A person who ignores the law** shows no fear of the Lord (*1:7*), the lawgiver. That person’s prayers are hypocritical—why should God listen to them?\n\n
28:12	idm78784					 **When the wicked take charge:** See also *28:28*.\n\n
28:13	idm78792					 The wise admit their mistakes and sins and pursue correction (see *Ps 32:1-5*).\n\n
28:15	idm78799					 A **wicked ruler** will not help the **poor** because his rule is not just. Like a **roaring lion or an attacking bear***,* he destroys their lives.\n\n
28:17	idm78809					 **tormented conscience:** See *1 Sam 25:31*; *Rom 2:15*; *13:5*; cp. *Heb 10:22*. • **Don’t protect him!** Murder is such a serious offense that a fine could not replace the death penalty (see *Num 35:32*).\n\n
28:19	idm78822					 This proverb is repeated but with a different conclusion in *12:11*.\n\n
28:20	idm78829					 **quick riches:** Wealth must be earned ethically, or it will cause harm and will not last (see *13:11*, cp. *10:2*; *11:18*; *13:22*; *21:6*).\n\n
28:21	idm78841					 Rendering a wrong verdict based on a bribe is evil (*17:23*; *22:16*).\n\n
28:23	idm78849					 The wise desire **honest criticism** of their faults so they can improve (*10:17*; *13:1*, *10*; *15:24*, *31-32*).\n\n
28:24	idm78861					 Callous children who exploit their parents are wicked (see *Exod 20:12*).\n\n
28:25	idm78868					 Those who are greedy fight to control circumstances so as to gain riches. **Trusting the** Lord allows the wise to face life calmly and, ironically, to experience **prosperity**.\n\n
28:26	idm78877					 The one who **walks in wisdom** listens to the advice of others; **those who trust their own insight** show themselves **foolish**.\n\n
28:28	idm78886					 **When the wicked take charge:** See also *28:12*.\n\n
29:3	idm78894					 A man’s **wisdom** affects his parents (*10:1*; *15:20*; *17:21*). • **Prostitutes** cost money and a man’s **wealth** is rapidly **wasted** on them.\n\n
29:4	idm78907					 A **just king** looks out for the rights of others; a ruler who accepts **bribes** uses his office for personal gain (see also *17:23*; *22:16*; *28:21*).\n\n
29:5	idm78918					 Flattery is usually **a trap** to taking advantage of someone (*7:21-22*; *26:23*).\n\n
29:11	idm78927					 **Wise** people learn to control their emotions; they remain calm even under stress.\n\n
29:13	idm78934					 **The oppressor** should be motivated to treat **the poor** more humanely because God created them **both** (see also *3:27*; *11:24*; *28:27*; *29:7*).\n\n
29:15	idm78947					 **Wisdom** is not instinctive—it must be taught.\n\n
29:18	idm78954					 The wise **accept divine guidance** from God’s law, the guide to his will.\n\n
29:19	idm78961					 In some instances of **discipline***,* tangible consequences might need to accompany instructions.\n\n
29:23	idm78969					 See *6:17-18*; *11:2*; *13:10*; *15:33*; *16:18-19*; *18:12*; *19:20*; *22:4*.\n\n
29:24	idm78983					 **You are sworn to tell the truth:** See *Lev 5:1*.\n\n
29:25	idm78991					 **Fearing people is a dangerous trap:** See *1:7*; *Luke 12:4-5*.\n\n
30:1	idm79000					 This superscription probably refers to the whole of ch *30*. • **Agur son of Jakeh:** Apart from this reference, Agur and Jakeh are unknown. If “from Massa” is the correct reading, then Agur was a non-Israelite (the tribe of Massa is known from Assyrian texts).\n\n
30:1	idm79008					 Agur expresses his ignorance (cp. *Ps 73:22*, where the psalmist calls himself a *senseless animal*). The first step toward wisdom is acknowledging what we do not know.\n\n
30:4	idm79016					 In contrast to Agur’s ignorance and powerlessness stands the strength and wisdom of **God** (cp. *Ps 18:30*). This is good news to Agur, who understands that God is **a shield to all who come to him for protection**.\n\n
30:7	idm79025					 Agur requests **two favors** from God: that God will help him not to **lie** (cp. *6:16-19*; *14:5*, *25*; *25:18*; *26:18-19*) and that he not be given too much or too little. It is not sinful to be rich (*3:9-10*, *15-16*; *10:15*, *22*) or poor (*3:27*; *11:24*; *28:27*; *29:7*, *14*), but Agur wisely wanted to avoid the pitfalls of both.\n\n
30:11	idm79047					 These verses summarize the character traits that wise people despise. Fools dishonor their parents (*10:1*; *20:20*; *Exod 20:12*; *Deut 5:16*), deceive themselves (*Prov 8:7*), think they are **pure** when they are **filthy** (*20:9*), are proud (*6:17-18*; *11:2*; *13:10*; *15:33*; *16:18*; *18:12*; *19:20*; *29:23*), wound others with their words (**teeth like swords***,* see *25:18*), and harm the poor (*3:27*; *11:24*; *28:27*; *29:7*, *14*).\n\n
30:15	idm79077					 The number parallelism (**three . . . no, four**) is a device for presenting a list of poetic examples. This list shows powers that are insatiable and often dangerous. See also *30:18-19*, *21-23*, *29-31*. • The **grave**, which stands for death itself, never seems to have enough—people keep dying (*27:20*). • **barren womb:** Women who are unable to have children often long to have them, like Sarah until she gave birth to Isaac, Rebekah until the birth of Esau and Jacob, and Hannah until the birth of Samuel. • The **thirsty desert** and a **fire** consume anything in their path.\n\n
30:17	idm79092					 People who are callous toward their parents will meet a violent end (see *10:1*; *19:26*; *28:24*; *29:3*; *30:11*).\n\n
30:18	idm79103					 The writer stands amazed at how one thing moves on another.\n\n
30:20	idm79109					 The writer expresses horror at sex outside of marriage.\n\n
30:21	idm79115					 This proverb lists **four** things that **make the earth tremble** because they overturn the order of things. • **who prospers** (literally *who is full of bread*): In the ancient Near East as in much of the non-industrialized world today, having adequate food (bread) was a sign of prosperity.\n\n
30:24	idm79125					 Another example of number parallelism. Here, small, insignificant animals are surprisingly powerful and resourceful.\n\n
31:1	idm79131					 **Lemuel,** like Agur, might have been from Massa (see *study note on 30:1*). Lemuel’s mother’s teaching encourages him to control his lusts (particularly for women and alcohol) so that he might reign justly. • Apart from this passage, Lemuel is unknown.\n\n
31:2	idm79139					 The admonition not to **waste** energy on lust for **women** echoes earlier warnings (ch *5*; *6:20-35*; *7:1-27*).\n\n
31:4	idm79150					 Too much **wine** numbs the senses. A king needs his wits about him and should not overindulge in **alcohol**.\n\n
31:8	idm79158					 Rather than opening his mouth to drink wine (*31:4-7*), the king should **speak up** on behalf of the defenseless.\n\n
31:10	idm79166					 Proverbs ends with a powerful poem celebrating the virtuous wife. The poem’s acrostic arrangement gives an impression of completeness and provides the student with an aid for learning.\n\n
31:10	idm79172					 No one can **find a virtuous and capable wife** without God’s help (*18:22*). Such a woman, like wisdom, is **more precious than rubies** (cp. *3:15*).\n\n
31:13	idm79182					 This wife works to provide food and clothing for her family.\n\n
31:16	idm79188					 An excellent wife is engaged in commercial enterprises outside her home.\n\n
31:19	idm79194					 A virtuous wife is generous to the poor, another characteristic of wise people (*11:24-26*; *21:13*; *22:9*, *16*, *22-23*; *28:27*).\n\n
31:22	idm79206					 A capable wife’s industriousness enables her husband to distinguish himself among community leaders. In ancient Israel, **civic leaders** met at the **city gates** to conduct trials and make decisions.\n\n
31:25	idm79214					 The noble wife’s character exemplifies wisdom. She is coolheaded as she faces future uncertainties. She gives advice in a winsome way.\n\n
31:28	idm79220					 Those most important to the woman testify to her character, abilities, and achievements.\n\n
31:30	idm79226					 The book concludes where it began, by affirming the ultimate importance of the fear of **the** Lord (see *1:7*). A woman’s character is more important than her physical **beauty**.\n\n
