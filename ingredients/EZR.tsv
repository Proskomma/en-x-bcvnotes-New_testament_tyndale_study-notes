1:1	idm51759					 The first three verses of Ezra appear almost verbatim in *2 Chr 36:22-23*, suggesting continuity between the books.\n\n
1:1	idm51766					 **King Cyrus** II reigned over **Persia** from 559 to 530 BC. Cyrus and his Persian forces defeated the city of Babylon in October, 539 BC, just as Daniel had predicted (*Dan 5*). • **the prophecy . . . through Jeremiah:** God had promised to return his people after seventy years in exile (*Jer 25:11-12*; *29:10*). • God’s power over the **heart** and mind of this pagan king moved him to enact the decree that follows (see also *Isa 13:17*; *41:2*, *25*; *Jer 50:9*). God is sovereign, even when rulers and nations do not recognize his authority (*Isa 10:5*, *12-14*).\n\n
1:2	idm51787					 Though Cyrus speaks of **the** Lord**, the God of heaven,** Cyrus actually was a Zoroastrian. His proclamation, written in Hebrew, was probably political propaganda to gain Jewish support for his rule. In a similar statement to the Babylonians, Cyrus claimed to worship their chief god, Marduk. However, his words here do reflect that God had **appointed** him **to build him a Temple at Jerusalem** (see *Isa 44:28*; *45:1*, *13*). He might have learned of such prophecies from Daniel, who served in his court as a high government official (Cyrus is apparently referred to by his Median name, Darius, in *Dan 6:1-28*; *9:1*). God had long planned to raise up Cyrus and give him a vision to restore worship at Jerusalem (*Isa 44:28*; *45:13*; *48:14-15*).\n\n
1:3	idm51806					 **Any of you who are his people may go:** The Assyrians and Babylonians had ruled their empires by deporting people and spreading them out in cities throughout their empires. The Persians, by contrast, returned exiled people to their homelands, expecting the returned people to be thankful, obey the Persians, and pay their taxes.\n\n
1:4	idm51813					 Cyrus was probably not urging Babylonian **neighbors** of the **Jewish remnant** to help the Hebrews. Rather, he was encouraging Jews who had decided to stay in Babylon to help their countrymen who were returning to Jerusalem.\n\n
1:5	idm51821					 As he had done with the heart of Cyrus (*1:1*), **God stirred the hearts** of Israel’s leaders. • Very few **priests** and **Levites** actually responded (see *2:36-42*). Most of the people who did respond were from two tribes, **Judah** and **Benjamin**. Persian documents show that many Jews stayed in Babylon, where they had homes, businesses, and relatives. A dangerous four-month trip back to the desolate city of Jerusalem, now inhabited by foreigners, was not an inviting choice compared to their comfortable life in Babylon. It was much easier to give **many valuable gifts** and **voluntary offerings** to those who did return.\n\n
1:7	idm51836					 Many **articles . . . from the** Lord**’s Temple** had been taken to Babylon (see *2 Chr 36:7*; *Dan 1:2*). By putting these items in his pagan temple, **Nebuchadnezzar** had attempted to show his god’s power over the Hebrew God. However, God had promised the return of all the stolen items (see *Jer 27:16-22*). The items from the Temple were holy utensils, acceptable to God for worship and very valuable to the returning worshipers.\n\n
1:8	idm51849					 **Sheshbazzar** was the Persian-appointed governor of Judah who laid the foundation of the Temple (*5:14-16*). Some believe that Zerubbabel (*3:2*, *8*) was the same person with a new name (cp. *Dan 1:7*). However, both names are Babylonian, so it is more likely that these two leaders worked together on the Temple foundation and that Zerubbabel later took over as governor when Sheshbazzar died.\n\n
1:9	idm51860					 **5,400 articles of gold and silver:** The numbers listed total only 2,499 items. A parallel account, in the apocryphal book *1 Esdras* 2:13-15, lists 5,469 items, while a list in the Jewish historian Josephus’s *Antiquities* 11.15 lists 5,220 objects. Ezra’s shortened list illustrates the kind of items included but does not include every item. Keeping track of consecrated utensils reduced the possibility of confusing these sacred items with the pagan utensils used in the worship of other gods.\n\n
2:1	idm51869					 This chapter is the first of Ezra’s major digressions from the main story line. The returning exiles needed to keep track of who the true Jews were so that the community could maintain its identity (by knowing whom they could marry) and theological purity (by knowing who could worship at the Temple). This list is not an initial list (cp. *Neh 7:6-73*) of all the Jews who returned to Jerusalem but a slightly later list (after Sheshbazzar had died) of people who had settled in their towns.\n\n
2:2	idm51876					 **Jeshua** (a variant spelling of *Joshua*), son of Jehozadak (*3:2*, *8*), from the line of Aaron, was the high priest (*Hag 1:1*; *Zech 3:1*). The **Nehemiah** mentioned here is not the person who later built the walls of Jerusalem, nor is this **Mordecai** the famous relative of Esther.\n\n
2:3	idm51890					 **The family of:** In the ancient Near East, an individual’s identity was closely connected to the question, “Who are your father and your family?” Ultimately, the priests were identified as the sons of Aaron. If this link could not be verified, they were barred from service (*2:61-62*). Others were identified by a well-known elder in their group.\n\n
2:21	idm51898					 **The people of . . . The citizens of:** Some of the returnees were identified by their towns of origin. Apparently, not all knew their genealogical histories or had large families with renowned leaders. Most of the cities mentioned were concentrated in a relatively small area in the vicinity of Jerusalem.\n\n
2:36	idm51905					 **the priests . . . the Levites:** Only seventy-four Levites returned to Jerusalem—a very low number. Ezra later worked hard to get thirty-eight more to come with him (see *study note on 8:18*).\n\n
2:41	idm51913					 The **singers** played instruments and sang for worship at the Temple (*1 Chr 25:1-31*; *Pss 73–83*) while the **gatekeepers** regulated the Temple gates and storehouses (*1 Chr 9:26-27*; *2 Chr 23:19*; *Neh 12:25*). • **Asaph** was one of the three Levites David had appointed to conduct music at the Temple (*1 Chr 16:5*, *7*), and he wrote a collection of psalms (*Pss 50*, *73–83*). His **family** carried on his work (*1 Chr 25:1-7*).\n\n
2:43	idm51933					 The **Temple servants** were probably descendants of the Gibeonites (*Josh 9:23-27*). They assisted the Levites (*8:20*) by carrying water and wood and by sweeping floors.\n\n
2:55	idm51942					 The **descendants** of the **servants of King Solomon** are connected with the Temple servants (*2:43-54*). Their names might indicate their responsibilities: e.g., **Hassophereth** (“the scribe”) probably kept inventories, and **Pokereth-hazzebaim** (“gazelle-hunter”) likely hunted game.\n\n
2:59	idm51953					 Some returnees believed in Israel’s God but had no genealogical records to **prove** that they were Israelites. Without this information, the other Israelites did not know whether to treat them as brothers and intermarry with them or to treat them as outsiders. The genealogies in *1 Chr 1–9* illustrate how carefully many family histories were kept.\n\n
2:61	idm51961					 **were not found:** The lack of a genealogy was problematic for three families (*2:61-62*). They were excluded from priestly privileges or responsibilities until the high priest received divine direction through the use of the **Urim and Thummim** to determine the will of God (see *Exod 28:30*; *Num 27:21*). Although using the *Urim and Thummim* resembled throwing dice or drawing straws, when done by the priest, the result was a divine decision rather than blind chance.\n\n
2:64	idm51973					 **42,360 people:** This number, which does not match the total of individuals (28,774) listed in *2:3-42*, might include children. • The large number of **servants** and animals shows that some of the Jews who returned were wealthy.\n\n
2:68	idm51982					 As when the Tabernacle was built (*Exod 25:2-7*; *35:4-9*) and the Temple was renovated (*2 Kgs 12:1-21*), the people gave **voluntary offerings** to finance this effort. These funds supplemented the provincial grant by Darius (*Ezra 6:8*) and gifts from Israelites who stayed in Babylon (*1:6*). Each **gave as much as he could** based on his resources.\n\n
2:69	idm51995					 Each of the **gold coins** (Hebrew *darics*) was worth a month’s wages for a professional soldier. • **6,250 pounds** (Hebrew *5,000 minas*): Each mina weighed 20 ounces and was equal to 60 shekels of silver; each shekel was worth an average worker’s monthly wages.\n\n
3:1	idm52005					 After resettling in various towns in Judah, the community turned to restoring the worship of God at Jerusalem. They quickly rebuilt the altar and began regular sacrifices in time to celebrate the Jewish festivals (*3:4*), and then they began the more difficult task of rebuilding the Temple itself (*3:8*). Soon they faced opposition from local foreigners (*4:1-5*).\n\n
3:1	idm52014					 Festivals **in early autumn** (literally *in the seventh month*) included the Festival of Trumpets (see *Lev 23:23-25*), the Day of Atonement (see *Lev 16*), and the Festival of Shelters (see *Lev 23:34-36*).\n\n
3:2	idm52025					 **Jeshua** (*Hag 1:1*; *Zech 3:1*) was the high priest (*Neh 12:1*). However, Ezra never used this title (*Ezra 2:2*; *3:2*; *4:3*; *5:2*), which suggests that the title was given after the Temple was completed (*6:15*). • **Zerubbabel** served as the Persian-appointed governor of Judah (*Hag 1:1*), most likely after the death of Sheshbazzar (see *study note on Ezra 1:8*). He was the grandson of King Jehoiachin of Judah (*1 Chr 3:17*).\n\n
3:3	idm52044					 The **local residents** were foreigners resettled from abroad by the Assyrian king Esarhaddon (680–669 BC) after the people of the northern kingdom of Israel were exiled in 722 BC (*2 Kgs 17:24-40*). Some had moved into the Jerusalem area during Judah’s seventy-year exile. A pagan altar might have been erected on the site, and it needed to be torn down before the new one, dedicated to the Lord, could be built. • **at its old site** (Literally *on its foundations*): It was important to place the altar at the exact sacred spot where Solomon’s altar had been to connect with the authentic worship carried on before the Exile. • Daily **morning and evening** sacrifices (see *Exod 29:38-42*; *Num 28:3-8*) dedicated the day to God.\n\n
3:4	idm52059					 The seven-day **Festival of Shelters . . . prescribed in the Law** (*Lev 23:33-36*; *Num 29:12-38*; *Deut 16:13-16*) reminded the people of God’s guidance and care during the forty years the nation spent in tents during the wilderness journey from Egypt to the Promised Land. This festival was especially significant to those who had just experienced a similar journey from a foreign land, living in tents as they walked to the Promised Land.\n\n
3:5	idm52069					 The catalog of sacrifices, offered even before the Temple’s foundation was laid, showed the people’s enthusiasm for faithfully worshiping God at every opportunity. They did everything exactly as they were instructed in the law. • The **new moon celebrations** took place on the first day of every Hebrew month; the sacrifices and blowing of trumpets reminded the people of God’s covenant with them (*Num 10:10*; *28:11-15*). • **Voluntary offerings** were such gifts as money for building the Temple (*Exod 35:29*; *36:3*). The Hebrew term can also refer to peace offerings of meat or bread that were eaten to celebrate fellowship with God (*Lev 7:11-21*).\n\n
3:7	idm52082					 **Tyre and Sidon:** Few tall and straight trees grew in the dry climate of Judah, and those that had grown in Israel had already been cut down. Therefore, skilled laborers were hired in countries that had tall trees (see also *1 Chr 22:1-5*; *2 Chr 2:7-16*).\n\n
3:8	idm52091					 In **midspring,** the dry season was beginning and workers would not have to contend with mud. • The **second year after they arrived** was probably 536 BC. The delay in rebuilding reflects the time it took to get wood from Lebanon to Jerusalem. • **The work force was made up of everyone:** This showed the spirit of unity among the returned exiles. Putting **the Levites . . . in charge** ensured that the work was done according to God’s specifications.\n\n
3:10	idm52102					 The music at this dedication ceremony sounded similar to the singing when Solomon first brought the Ark into the Temple (*2 Chr 5:12-13*). Both events caused the worshipers to give**sing** **praise and thanks . . . to the** Lord for his faithful covenant love and goodness. • **as King David had prescribed:** See *1 Chr 25:1-7*.\n\n
3:12	idm52114					 Those who **wept aloud** either were disappointed that the foundation of the Temple wasn’t as wonderful as the old one had been (cp. *Hag 2:3*) or were deeply moved with joy at seeing the Temple of the Lord restored.\n\n
4:1	idm52122					 **Judah and Benjamin:** Most of the exiles who had returned were from these two tribes of Israel (*1:5*).\n\n
4:2	idm52130					 **King Esarhaddon of Assyria** (680–669 BC) had deported the people of Israel to foreign lands and had relocated other conquered peoples to the land of Israel during the reign of King Manasseh in Judah. These foreigners had learned about the Lord when they entered the land of Israel but had also continued to worship their old gods (*2 Kgs 17:27-34*, *40-41*).\n\n
4:3	idm52140					 The key political, religious, and tribal leaders spoke with a unified voice against the foreigners’ proposal, which would have opened the door for their idolatrous beliefs. The Jews did not want to make the same mistake as their ancestors, who were sent into exile as a result of worshiping the false gods of the Canaanites. • **as King Cyrus of Persia commanded us:** See *1:2-4*.\n\n
4:4	idm52148					 Realizing that they would have no way to influence an established Jewish community (*4:1-3*), the foreigners took hostile measures to neutralize the growing political power of the Israelites.\n\n
4:5	idm52155					 The people paid a heavy price for their uncompromising commitment to holiness. • **King Cyrus** reigned until 530 BC. **Darius** (Darius I) took the throne **of Persia** in 521 BC. Work on the Temple resumed in 520 BC and was finished in 515 BC (see *6:15*).\n\n
4:6	idm52169					 These verses are a parenthetical discussion of later opposition to Jewish rebuilding efforts. The account actually belongs with much later events in the reign of Xerxes (486–465 BC) and Artaxerxes I (465–424 BC), but it is included here because it fits with the theme of opposition. Chronologically, *4:6* fits between chs *6* and *7*, while *4:7-23* fits before *Neh 1*.\n\n
4:7	idm52182					 The exact date of these events is unknown, but they might have occurred around the same time as an Egyptian revolt in 448 BC (a few years before **Artaxerxes** I sent Nehemiah to Jerusalem in 445 BC). If so, **the enemies of Judah** and Artaxerxes probably thought that the Jews would revolt as the Egyptians had. • **Aramaic** was the international diplomatic language of the Persian Empire.\n\n
4:9	idm52193					 Adding greetings from an assortment of key political figures and local ethnic leaders would give credibility to the letter’s accusations and ensure that the message would have maximum political weight. • **Judges** were trusted court officials who knew the Persian laws. • Having the support of people from the Mesopotamian cities of Babylon and **Erech** and the Persian city of **Susa** would make the case against the Jews more persuasive.\n\n
4:10	idm52202					 **Ashurbanipal had deported** people from other conquered lands into the lands of Israel and Aram (see *2 Kgs 17:24-41*). • The city of **Samaria** was the former capital of the northern kingdom of Israel. • **The province west of the Euphrates River** included Syria, Israel, and Judah.\n\n
4:11	idm52212					 Ezra includes a copy in Aramaic of the letter sent to Artaxerxes and his reply.\n\n
4:13	idm52218					 A **tribute** was an annual fixed tax, **customs** were probably sales taxes, and **tolls** were probably charges for using roads. Previous rulers had collected considerable revenue from the region (*4:20*; cp. *1 Kgs 10:14-15*).\n\n
4:14	idm52229					 **Since we are your loyal subjects:** The Aramaic phrase *we eat the salt of the palace* was a metaphor for taking an oath of loyalty to the king. • The letter’s authors claimed that their only interest was to preserve the honor of the king, but they were actually grasping for power and political advantage over the Jews.\n\n
4:15	idm52237					 The Persians had access to Babylonian **records***,* which described Jerusalem’s revolts against Nebuchadnezzar (see *2 Kgs 24:1-7*). • The claim that the Persians would lose the whole **province west of the Euphrates** was an exaggeration: The Jews actually comprised a small minority in that province.\n\n
4:18	idm52247					 The letter was **translated** from Aramaic to Persian, the king’s native language.\n\n
4:19	idm52254					 King Jehoiakim (609–598 BC) had rebelled against Babylon in about 601 BC, and King Zedekiah (597–586 BC) had rebelled in about 588 BC (see *2 Kgs 25:2*).\n\n
4:21	idm52265					 **except at my express command:** Work on the walls remained stopped until 445 BC, when Nehemiah, Artaxerxes’ cup-bearer, gained his permission to resume reconstruction (see *Neh 2:1-6*).\n\n
4:23	idm52274					 A military unit probably **forced the Jews to stop building** and enforced the king’s wishes. Part of the rebuilt wall might have been torn down at this time (cp. *Neh 1:3*). • This verse ends the parenthetical section that began in *Ezra 4:6*.\n\n
4:24	idm52283					 Ezra now returns to telling about the building of the Temple in 520–515 BC.\n\n
4:24	idm52290					 The events of the following verses occurred approximately sixteen years after the events up through *4:5*.\n\n
5:1	idm52297					 **Haggai** first prophesied on August 29, 520 BC (*Hag 1:1*). **Zechariah** began prophesying about two months later (*Zech 1:1*). The books of Haggai and Zechariah record their messages (see also *Ezra 6:14*).\n\n
5:2	idm52309					 The Jewish leaders had not led by faith (see *Hag 1:1*, *12*). Now God’s Spirit stirred them up (*Hag 1:14*), and they obeyed by getting to work. • **Zerubbabel** and **Jeshua** figure prominently in the books of Haggai and Zechariah.\n\n
5:3	idm52320					 **Who gave you permission?** Unlike the hostile opposition recorded in ch *4*, this seems to have been a routine inquiry to make sure that everything was done according to official requirements.\n\n
5:5	idm52328					 **God was watching over them:** All credit goes to God’s sovereign control of events, not to any human leader or prophet. God had promised that the ruins would be rebuilt (*Isa 44:26*).\n\n
5:6	idm52336					 Ezra includes a copy in Aramaic of Tattenai’s letter to King Darius. Unlike the letter of *4:11-16*, this letter was a straightforward inquiry into the validity of the Jews’ activity.\n\n
5:6	idm52343					 **other officials:** A Persian term for *inspectors* or *investigators.*\n\n
5:8	idm52352					 **the great God:** This title was a Persian way of referring to an important high deity; it does not indicate that the provincial authorities believed in Israel’s God. • Following the pattern of Solomon’s Temple (*1 Kgs 6:36*), after every three rows of **prepared stones***,* a layer of **timber** was **laid in its walls** (see *Ezra 6:4*) to reduce potential damage from earthquakes.\n\n
5:11	idm52365					 **the God of heaven:** This title would be understood by the Persians: He was the universal high God, not an insignificant local deity. • **a great king of Israel:** Solomon (see *1 Kgs 5–8*).\n\n
5:12	idm52374					 **destroyed this Temple and exiled the people:** See *2 Kgs 25:9-17*.\n\n
5:13	idm52382					 **a decree:** See *1:1-4*.\n\n
5:14	idm52390					 The Jews provided detailed information that the Persians could check for accuracy (see *1:7-11*).\n\n
5:16	idm52397					 Most likely, **Sheshbazzar** began the work and Zerubbabel finished it (see *study note on 1:8*).\n\n
6:2	idm52405					 The **fortress at Ecbatana***,* the king’s summer home, was located about 300 miles northeast of Babylon. This suggests that Cyrus wrote the scroll in the summer of 538 BC. • **Media** was a mountainous area north of Persia and east of Assyria. This area is now inhabited by the Kurds (descendants of the Medes). • Texts introduced by the term **Memorandum** tended to be summaries that listed the main facts of an event for the royal archives (cp. *1:9-10*).\n\n
6:3	idm52417					 This **decree** is recorded in *Ezra 1:2-4*. • The Temple’s **height will be ninety feet, and its width will be ninety feet:** The emendations given in the NLT textual note would make these measurements match those of Solomon’s Temple (*1 Kgs 6:2*, *17*, *20*). But the larger measurements given here might represent the maximum size that the Persians would fund.\n\n
6:4	idm52429					 **All expenses will be paid by the royal treasury.** Although it seems surprising that the Persians would do this, it was consistent with Persian practice elsewhere (e.g., at Sais and Elephantine in Egypt, and at Ur in Mesopotamia). Such generosity was designed to ensure loyalty to Persia.\n\n
6:8	idm52436					 **You must pay the full construction costs:** This command fulfilled God’s promise through Haggai (*Hag 2:7*).\n\n
6:10	idm52444					 **pray for the welfare of the king and his sons:** In the Cyrus Cylinder (a Persian account of Cyrus’s defeat of Babylon), King Cyrus requests, “May all the gods whom I have resettled in their sacred cities ask [the Babylonian gods] Bel and Nebo daily for a long life for me” (see *1:1-4*).\n\n
6:11	idm52452					 **Those who violate this decree:** Inscriptions and official decrees often included curses on those who opposed the will of the king (cp. *Dan 2:5*).\n\n
6:15	idm52460					 Israel’s second **Temple** was finished approximately seventy years after its destruction by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BC. Herod the Great remodeled and expanded this Temple at the time of Christ. The Temple stood for approximately 585 years until the Roman army of Titus destroyed it in AD 70.\n\n
6:17	idm52469					 **12 male goats . . . a sin offering:** This blood sacrifice brought God’s forgiveness for unintentional sins, ceremonial uncleanness, or thoughtless wrong acts (*Lev 4–5*). Similar sacrifices were offered when Moses dedicated the Tabernacle (*Num 7*) and when Solomon dedicated the first Temple (*2 Chr 7:1*, *4*). • **for the twelve tribes of Israel:** Although most returnees were from Judah and Benjamin (*Ezra 1:5*; *4:1*), people from the priestly tribe of Levi are also mentioned (*1:5*; *2:40*, *70*). It is also likely that there were returnees from some of the ten northern tribes of Israel. Even if all tribes were not physically represented, the twelve sacrifices emphasized the desire for God to maintain his covenant relationship with all Israel.\n\n
6:18	idm52486					 **prescribed in the Book of Moses:** See *Exod 29*; *Lev 8*; *Num 3*. The Temple personnel operated according to the organization instituted by David (*1 Chr 23–27*). • This verse concludes the Aramaic section that began in *Ezra 4:8*.\n\n
6:19	idm52498					 The **Passover** celebration commemorates God’s sparing of the firstborn of each family that put blood on the doorposts of their home (*Exod 12–13*). This occasion was the first time any of these people had celebrated a joyous national festival.\n\n
6:20	idm52506					 **purified themselves:** They acted in accord with the law of Moses (see *Lev 9*; *Num 8*; *2 Chr 29*).\n\n
6:21	idm52516					 **and by the others in the land who had turned from their immoral customs:** The exclusion of foreigners in *4:1-5* was due to their pagan religious practices, not their ethnicity (see also *9:1-2*).\n\n
6:22	idm52525					 Passover was the beginning of the seven-day **Festival of Unleavened Bread** (see *Exod 12:15-20*; *Lev 23:6-8*), a time of feasting in remembrance of the unleavened bread eaten when Israel left Egypt. • **the** Lord** had caused:** Although Darius I was the powerful king of a vast empire, God directed his heart to help **rebuild the Temple of God**.\n\n
7:1	idm52538					 Ezra highlights his standing by listing his own genealogy through Zadok, priest under Solomon (*1 Kgs 2:35*), all the way back to **Aaron the high priest***,* Moses’ brother. This list is clearly abbreviated: It has only sixteen generations from Aaron to eighty years after the Exile, while *1 Chr 6:3-15* has twenty-three generations from Aaron to the Exile.\n\n
7:1	idm52548					 **Many years later:** Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in 458 BC (*7:7-8*), about fifty-seven years after the dedication of the second Temple. Ezra has been recording events that occurred before his time, but now he begins to record his own history. • **son:** In biblical genealogies, the Hebrew word translated *son* often means *descendant.* • **Seraiah** was high priest under Zedekiah; he was executed by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BC (*2 Kgs 25:18-21*).\n\n
7:6	idm52563					 **Ezra** came from **Babylon***,* where there was still a substantial and prosperous Jewish community. • The Hebrew term translated **scribe** is sometimes translated as “secretary.” It describes an educated and reliable individual who transcribed and interpreted official documents. Accordingly, many scholars think that Ezra functioned like a “Secretary of State for Jewish Affairs” in the Persian government. Here, however, the emphasis is on his scribal role of studying and teaching from the five Books of Moses.\n\n
7:9	idm52573					 Ezra and his entourage **had arranged to leave Babylon on April 8** but did not actually leave until April 19, 458 BC (*8:31*). In those intervening eleven days, he organized the group and assembled it at the Ahava Canal, searched for more Levites, and proclaimed a fast. • To make the 800-mile journey in four months, Ezra’s party would have walked an average of about ten miles per day, five days per week. Ezra knew that his success was attributable only to **the gracious hand of his God** (see also *7:6*, *28*; *8:22*, *31*).\n\n
7:10	idm52587					 **Ezra** had three life goals: (1) **to study** God’s word, (2) to **obey** what God said, and (3) to **teach . . . the people of Israel**. He allowed God’s word to transform his character and behavior so that he could influence the lives of others.\n\n
7:11	idm52597					 In this **letter***,* King Artaxerxes granted Ezra the power and responsibility to evaluate the situation in Jerusalem (*7:14*), present freewill offerings to God (*7:15-20*), obtain supplies and finances from local authorities (*7:21-24*), and institute judicial reforms (*7:25-26*).\n\n
7:14	idm52609					 **I and my council of seven:** The Greek historian Xenophon knew of this council (Xenophon, *Anabasis* 1.6.4-5), and *Esth 1:14* lists the names of the seven princes of Xerxes, Artaxerxes’ father. • **your God’s law:** The word translated *law* in this verse is the Aramaic word dath rather than the Hebrew *torah* (*7:10*), suggesting that a Persian wrote this letter (*7:11-26*).\n\n
7:15	idm52624					 **who lives in Jerusalem:** God’s Temple was located there. Artaxerxes probably thought that he was helping rebuild the house of Jerusalem’s local deity (cp. *1 Kgs 8:27*; *Ps 24:1*).\n\n
7:16	idm52633					 Like Cyrus (*1:4*, *6*), Artaxerxes allowed Jews in Babylon to send freewill offerings to Jerusalem. A sizeable sum was collected from the king and his council as well as from Jewish contributors (*8:25-27*).\n\n
7:21	idm52642					 The items listed were typically used as offerings in worship (cp. *Exod 27:20*; *29:2*; *Lev 2:4*, *13*; *14:10*; *Num 28:7*).\n\n
7:23	idm52654					 **the God of heaven:** This is the title by which the Jews had referred to the Lord (*5:11-12*) and that Cyrus had used (*1:2*). The Persian king probably believed, like others in the ancient Near East, that each country’s god or gods controlled their territory. Artaxerxes did not want to **risk bringing God’s anger against the realm of the king** and undermine the peace of his empire by failing to provide for the God of Jerusalem (*7:19*) the worship that he required.\n\n
7:24	idm52665					 The tax exemptions given to Temple personnel in Jerusalem were similar to the conciliatory gestures made to those in other nations.\n\n
7:25	idm52671					 Ezra was to teach **God’s laws** and govern the area occupied by the Jews in accordance with God’s laws and **the law of the king**—i.e., Persian civil law.\n\n
8:1	idm52679					 This **list of the family leaders** designates those who stepped out in faith and traveled with Ezra back to Jerusalem to join the Jewish community there. It lists fifteen families represented by 1,515 men. Including women and children, the total could have been around 5,000 people.\n\n
8:15	idm52686					 The **Ahava Canal** came off the Euphrates River near Babylon. • **not one Levite had volunteered:** Only a few Levites had come earlier with Sheshbazzar (*2:40*). It is unclear why so few Levites returned to Jerusalem.\n\n
8:16	idm52695					 The Hebrew term translated **men of discernment** refers to those who could interpret and explain the Torah. These men were probably respected because of their expertise in Scripture (cp. *Neh 8:8-9*). Ezra commissioned them to use their influence to recruit more Levites.\n\n
8:18	idm52703					 **the gracious hand of our God:** Ezra, his leaders, and Iddo all took action to rectify the problem, but ultimately everything was accomplished because of God’s grace. Only thirty-eight Levites (including the leaders) and 220 Temple servants responded.\n\n
8:20	idm52710					 **first instituted by King David and his officials:** See *1 Chr 24–26*.\n\n
8:21	idm52718					 **fast and humble ourselves:** Ezra recognized the need to look to God for the protection, safety, and health of 5,000 people going 800 miles on foot. Robbers might be hiding in the hills, there was danger in crossing rivers, and people could get sick.\n\n
8:22	idm52725					 **ashamed:** Ezra had openly proclaimed his faith in God’s ability to protect the Israelites on their journey. Asking the king for help now would suggest that Ezra did not really believe in God’s ability to provide.\n\n
8:23	idm52732					 **fasted . . . prayed:** In the Old Testament, fasting often accompanied prayer as a demonstration of need before God (*1 Kgs 21:9*; *2 Chr 20:3*; *Neh 1:4*; *Dan 9:3*).\n\n
8:25	idm52743					 The items that the leaders were **in charge of transporting** included offerings for the Temple and sacrifices. Because these gifts belonged to God and were holy (*8:28*), it was necessary that the priests care for them.\n\n
8:26	idm52751					 The Persians and supportive Jews had given an enormous amount of money. It was a huge risk to transport it without a royal escort.\n\n
8:31	idm52757					 **We broke camp . . . on April 19:** It took twelve days to get organized, to encourage some Levites to join them, and to pray for God’s protection before Ezra could actually get the people moving toward Jerusalem (see *7:9*).\n\n
8:35	idm52765					 **sacrificed burnt offerings:** For many of the Jews who came to Jerusalem with Ezra, this was probably the first sacrifice they had ever offered. It would have been a moving spiritual experience for them to confess their sins and dedicate their lives to God in this way. For details on the burnt offering, see *Lev 1*.\n\n
9:1	idm52773					 Ezra confronted the problem of intermarriage with idolatrous foreigners. The Jewish leaders had allowed this practice, though the early settlers had committed to keep separate from pagan influences (*4:1-5*). Ezra interceded on behalf of the nation and helped those convicted of their sins to make things right.\n\n
9:1	idm52780					 The events that follow took place approximately four months after Ezra’s arrival (cp. *7:9*; *10:9*). • Intermarriage with pagan foreigners was dangerous because Israelites could end up worshiping other gods and accepting **the detestable practices of** other religions (cp. *Ezra 4:1-5*; *Deut 7:1-4*). • **the holy race has become polluted:** Literally *the holy seed has intermingled itself.* Because Israel was a holy covenant nation (*Exod 19:6*), it was not to be involved with pagan practices (*Lev 19:2-4*; *20:6-8*, *22-26*). Therefore, the people were to avoid marriages with those who could influence Israelites to embrace such practices. When the religious and political **leaders and officials** intermarried with foreigners, they were in danger of leading others astray and destroying the unique identity of Israel as a holy people.\n\n
9:3	idm52798					 **utterly shocked:** Cp. *Gen 37:34*; *2 Kgs 22:11*; *Job 1:20*.\n\n
9:4	idm52808					 **The time of the evening sacrifice** was around 3:00 pm.\n\n
9:5	idm52816					 Ezra’s inner humility before God was consistent with his falling on his **knees**. His outstretched **hands** demonstrated his pleading with God to intervene.\n\n
9:6	idm52824					 Ezra’s prayer provides a model for intercessory prayer (cp. *Neh 1:5-11*; *Dan 9:4-19*). It includes confessing sin (*Ezra 9:6-7*), remembering God’s past grace (*9:8-9*), admitting that the people have ignored God (*9:10-12*), and recognizing their unworthiness (*9:13-15*).\n\n
9:6	idm52836					 **I am utterly ashamed . . . our sins are piled higher than our heads:** Although he was not one of the offending parties, Ezra personally identified with his people (see “*Community Identity*” Theme Note).\n\n
9:7	idm52844					 Ezra forthrightly summarizes Israel’s past history. The people and their leaders had sinned and were justly punished. • **just as we are today:** The effects of Israel’s punishment were still evident in Jerusalem at this time.\n\n
9:8	idm52851					 God’s abundant **grace** and **unfailing love** should affect how people respond to him (cp. *Deut 30:1-5*). After all that God had done for the **remnant***,* it was shameful that they were so ready to betray him. • **the kings of Persia to treat us favorably:** Babylon and Assyria had tortured and exiled their enemies (*2 Kgs 17*; *25*), but Persia treated exiled people kindly and returned them to their homelands (see *Ezra 1:1-3*). • **protective wall:** This phrase refers to God’s presence protecting the nation of Judah, not the physical walls of Jerusalem, which were rebuilt several years later by Nehemiah.\n\n
9:11	idm52867					 **Your servants the prophets warned us:** God had clearly revealed what he expected from his people (see *Deut 7:3-4*; *Mal 2:10-12*) and had promised great blessings if they followed his covenant stipulations (see *Lev 26:1-13*; *Deut 28:1-14*; *Jer 32:36–33:18*; *Ezek 37:15-28*; *Hos 14:1-8*).\n\n
9:14	idm52881					 **Won’t your anger be enough to destroy us?** The sin of intermarriage with non-believers was so serious that they had no hope of survival if they did not repent.\n\n
9:15	idm52888					 **you are just:** God’s anger with sin is based on his justice and holiness.\n\n
10:1	idm52895					 Ezra’s genuine mourning in response to his people’s sin moved many of them to join him.\n\n
10:2	idm52901					 **Shecaniah** was the first person brave enough to publicly admit that he had been **unfaithful** to God. Admission of guilt gives the **hope** of forgiveness for sin.\n\n
10:3	idm52910					 A **covenant** is a binding agreement, in this case specifically **to divorce . . . pagan wives** that the people of Israel had inappropriately married. By taking this action, they would renew their commitment to the Sinai covenant. • Women were generally given custody of their **children** when a marriage failed (cp. Hagar and Ishmael, *Gen 21:14*).\n\n
10:4	idm52920					 **it is your duty:** As an expert in the law (see *7:10*), Ezra was responsible for leading the people to a God-honoring solution to the problem of intermarriage. Because the law of Moses did not contain explicit directions for divorcing pagan wives, Ezra needed to develop a plan consistent with the requirements of Scripture and fair to the participants.\n\n
10:5	idm52928					 The **solemn oath** involved both a promise to take action and a self-imposed curse for failure to do what was promised (see *Ruth 1:16-17*; *1 Sam 14:24-28*).\n\n
10:8	idm52937					 **if the leaders and elders so decided:** It was reasonable for Ezra to add this exception clause because it might simply be impossible for some people to come to Jerusalem to participate in settling this matter.\n\n
10:9	idm52944					 **on December 19 . . . it was raining:** The cold and wet weather made an outdoor meeting uncomfortable.\n\n
10:15	idm52951					 It is unclear why these four people **opposed** the plan. Perhaps they wanted a stricter penalty, or perhaps they or members of their families did not want to divorce their foreign wives. That there were only four dissenters shows the overwhelming support the policy had gained among the rest of the exiles. Sadly, a few years later, a similar problem of intermarriage with pagan wives created another crisis within the community (*Neh 9–10*).\n\n
10:44	idm52959					 **and some even had children by these wives:** The couples who had children had probably married before Ezra came back to Jerusalem; even they were not excused from the decree.\n\n
