1:1	idm79236					 Ecclesiastes never uses **the Teacher**’s (Hebrew *Qoheleth*) name, but **King David’s son** probably refers to Solomon (see also *1:12*, *16*; *2:4-9*).\n\n
1:2	idm79248					 The Teacher begins by observing that each natural and historical activity is accentuated by its circular repetitive rhythm of coming and going, being and not being. This can lead to the despairing cry that **everything is meaningless**. The Teacher moves rapidly from subject to subject and finishes this section with the topic he started with, using a literary pattern that mirrors the circularity he describes in nature and in human history.\n\n
1:2	idm79255					 **Everything is meaningless . . . completely meaningless** (literally *vapor of vapors, everything is vapor*): Wherever “meaningless” occurs in this book, the Hebrew word *hebel* (“breath, vapor”) is behind it. The Teacher’s conclusion is that everything is a transitory and meaningless vapor.\n\n
1:3	idm79264					 The Hebrew idiom **under the sun** is used twenty-nine times in Ecclesiastes. The NLT sometimes renders it with expressions such as “here on earth” (*2:18*) or “in this world” (*2:20*). It suggests a view of life that is earthbound rather than reflecting God’s perspective.\n\n
1:4	idm79273					 **Generations come** and **go**, and individual lives seem to pass away without significance.\n\n
1:7	idm79281					 **the sea is never full . . . we are never satisfied:** This image introduces the unfulfilling nature of life.\n\n
1:11	idm79288					 **no one will remember:** We cannot count on anyone remembering anything that we think we have achieved.\n\n
1:12	idm79295					 The Teacher explores the relationships among wisdom, work, and pleasure.\n\n
1:13	idm79301					 **God has dealt a tragic existence:** The grim realities of human experience remind us of the Fall in Eden (*Gen 3*). Ecclesiastes does not dodge depressing descriptions of death, oppression, and loneliness; it meets them head-on and incorporates them into realistic conclusions.\n\n
1:14	idm79309					 **like chasing the wind:** Just as the wind quickly comes and goes, so does life.\n\n
2:1	idm79316					 The Teacher dismisses the pursuit of pleasure for its own sake as hollow. Even great achievements are a vapor.\n\n
2:3	idm79322					 The Teacher understood that trying to **cheer** himself with **wine** was **foolishness***,* but he did it **while still seeking wisdom**—i.e., during his attempt to understand how **to experience . . . happiness.** This proved to be empty (*2:11*). • **brief life in this world:** The totality of human experience is “a breath.”\n\n
2:4	idm79336					 Solomon’s building achievements were as small as porches and gates and as large as entire cities (see *1 Kgs 9:15-19*). These projects, meant primarily for his own pleasure, included the palace and its accompanying buildings (see *1 Kgs 7:1-12*).\n\n
2:4	idm79344					 Solomon’s **vineyards** are mentioned in *Song 8:11-12*.\n\n
2:7	idm79352					 Solomon’s **slaves, . . . large herds, and flocks** were numerous, and caring for them consumed vast resources (*1 Kgs 4:22-23*; *9:20-21*).\n\n
2:8	idm79361					 **silver and gold . . . kings and provinces:** Solomon ruled from the Fertile Crescent (north and east of Israel) to the border of Egypt in the south. His wealth in precious metals came from trade, gifts from admiring rulers of other nations, and taxes from lands he held within his empire (*1 Kgs 4:21*; *9:28*; *10:14*, *22-25*; *1 Chr 29:4*; *2 Chr 9:26-27*). • **many beautiful concubines:** Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines by the end of his reign (*1 Kgs 11:3*).\n\n
2:9	idm79376					 **I became greater:** Cp. *1 Kgs 10:23*. • Solomon’s **wisdom** enabled his successful rise in power and prosperity (see *1 Kgs 3:2-14*; *4:20-34*).\n\n
2:10	idm79387					 **I even found great pleasure in hard work:** The Teacher introduces a significant, repetitive theme: Joy comes from wise and rigorous work (*5:12*, *18-20*).\n\n
2:11	idm79396					 **meaningless . . . nothing really worthwhile:** Accomplishment only brings hopelessness and discouragement because the accomplishment itself has no lasting meaning (*2:18-23*).\n\n
2:12	idm79404					 The Teacher now looks at the value of wisdom (*2:12-17*) and hard work (*2:18-23*). These, too, are “meaningless” (*2:17*).\n\n
2:12	idm79413					 **who can do this better than I, the king?** No one after the Teacher will have any better perspective for comparing wisdom and folly because nothing new will be done under the sun (*1:9-10*).\n\n
2:13	idm79421					 **Wisdom is better than foolishness:** Wisdom has value in navigating life successfully. It cannot, however, save one from the **fate** of death or provide meaning (*2:15-16*).\n\n
2:15	idm79430					 If **both** the wise and the foolish **will die***,* what advantage is there in being wise? Since the lives of both wise and foolish people are fleeting, the conclusion is that all is meaningless. • **both will be forgotten:** Those who follow us will not remember us or our accomplishments, so our efforts will come to nothing (cp. *1:11*; *9:13-16*).\n\n
2:17	idm79442					 The Teacher **came to hate life** because of its griefs (*1:18*), toils (*2:18*), and apparent futility (*2:19-20*).\n\n
2:19	idm79452					 **Foolish***,* destructive **successors** are more of a threat to wise accomplishments than wise successors, but since the Teacher couldn’t **tell** what kind of successors he would have, his accomplishments were **meaningless** to him. Solomon’s immediate successor—his son Rehoboam—turned out to be foolish (see *1 Kgs 12:1-20*).\n\n
2:21	idm79464					 **work wisely with knowledge and skill:** Skill in work is an expression of wisdom (e.g., see *Exod 31:1-5*). • **leave the fruit . . . to someone who hasn’t worked for it:** A person who has little personal investment tends to waste it or take foolish risks.\n\n
2:24	idm79473					 Though life “under the sun” (*1:3*) is like a vapor (*2:23*, “meaningless”), we should enjoy God’s good gifts of food, work, and wisdom.\n\n
2:24	idm79481					 **pleasures are from . . . God:** No one should discount God’s gifts, including the basic enjoyment of food and work. If God did not give them, they would not be available. We can be thankful and satisfied.\n\n
2:26	idm79488					 If a **sinner becomes wealthy***,* it is meaningless to him because **God takes the wealth away.**\n\n
3:1	idm79497					 **For everything there is a season, a time for every activity under heaven:** Wisdom recognizes that everything has its own season—in human activities as in the realm of nature (see *1:3-7*). A wise person will determine the appropriate time to pursue any activity (*8:5*). The opportunity is fleeting (*Eph 5:16*; *Col 4:5*).\n\n
3:2	idm79508					 We have no control over when we are **born** or when we **die** (*8:8*), but it is our responsibility to live wisely between those events. • **plant and . . . harvest:** Wise agricultural decisions must be made in the natural seasons. • In ancient Israel, the times to **kill** included capital punishment and war. • In times of mourning, people in the Near East would often **tear** their clothes. • There is **a time to hate***,* even for God (*Pss 5:5*; *11:5*).\n\n
3:9	idm79524					 Even though every activity has an appropriate occasion (*3:1-8*), only God can truly know what that occasion is (*3:9-11*). Mortals must be content with uncertainty and trust the sovereign God who gives enjoyment to those who work wisely and righteously.\n\n
3:9	idm79532					 **get for . . . hard work?** See *3:12-13*.\n\n
3:10	idm79540					 **the burden God has placed on us all:** God intensified the severity of our labor following humankind’s rebellion against him (*Gen 3:17-19*). This burden is not so great that we cannot enjoy our work and its fruits (*Eccl 3:11-13*).\n\n
3:11	idm79549					 **God has made everything beautiful for its own time:** We can sometimes see this beauty in our work and in the world, but many times **people cannot see***:* God reserves for himself the understanding of how everything fits together (cp. *Rom 8:22-28*). • God has **planted eternity***,* an awareness of the infinite, within each of us—enough for us to be in awe of him who is infinite and eternal, and enough to hope for eternal life after death.\n\n
3:12	idm79561					 **be happy and enjoy:** Though life and work can be burdensome, the Teacher’s conclusion (repeated from *2:24*) can still hold true.\n\n
3:14	idm79569					 Knowing that **whatever God does is final** is a reason to **fear him**—to trust and revere God and respect all that he does.\n\n
3:15	idm79577					 **The same things happen over and over again:** The repetitiveness of history (*1:9-10*) is part of God’s sovereign plan.\n\n
3:16	idm79585					 This section comments on a variety of topics, including justice, humans and animals, oppression, moderation, companionship, politics, and worship.\n\n
3:16	idm79591					 **courtroom** (literally *the place of justice*): In Israel, local court proceedings were held at the city gates, where the city’s elders sat to hear and adjudicate legal matters (e.g., see *Ruth 4:1-12*).\n\n
3:17	idm79600					 **In due season God will judge:** Human injustices (*3:16*) are temporary and will be righted by God’s justice. The narrator repeats this point to close the entire book (*12:14*).\n\n
3:19	idm79609					 With respect to breathing and dying, **people have no real advantage over the animals***,* but we have other advantages (e.g., see *Gen 1:26-28*).\n\n
3:20	idm79618					 **from dust . . . to dust:** The Teacher refers to God’s judgment against human rebellion in Eden (see *Gen 3:19*).\n\n
3:21	idm79626					 **the human spirit goes up:** Cp. *12:7*.\n\n
3:22	idm79634					 **happy in their work:** Work now stands alone as a source of enjoyment, apart from food and drink (cp. *2:24-25*; *3:12-13*).\n\n
4:1	idm79643					 **all the oppression:** Abuse is rampant at many levels in society—in family, religion, the workplace, government, and foreign powers.\n\n
4:2	idm79650					 Where oppression reigns, **the dead are better off than the living**. Those who have died are no longer mistreated.\n\n
4:4	idm79657					 **Most people are motivated to success** by a competitive drive. Since the fruits of these efforts have no intrinsic value, the Teacher recommends that moderation (*4:5-6*) replace envy.\n\n
4:5	idm79665					 **Fools** do not even try to succeed and end up impoverished. Others frantically devote **two handfuls**—all their time and effort—to **hard work** in pursuit of fleeting wealth that they will have no time to enjoy (cp. *Prov 23:4-5*). Wise people practice moderation and contentment (**quietness**).\n\n
4:7	idm79676					 This solitary man is a case study of the principle expressed in *4:6*.\n\n
4:9	idm79683					 **Two people are better off than one:** The solitary man (*4:8*) brings to mind the advantages of partnerships for business and for personal well-being.\n\n
4:13	idm79691					 **It is better to be . . . wise:** Wisdom is valuable for its practical benefits.\n\n
4:15	idm79698					 As with everything else, a ruler’s popularity is only temporary and fleeting, like **the wind**.\n\n
5:1	idm79705					 Though the **house of God** provides opportunity for reverent words and measured promises, it is primarily a place for listening.\n\n
5:3	idm79712					 **Too much activity . . . too many words:** Moderation should characterize our efforts and words (cp. *Prov 10:19*).\n\n
5:4	idm79720					 **Keep all the promises you make to him:** This is virtually a direct quote from the law (*Deut 23:21-23*; see also *Prov 12:22*; *20:25*). Vows to God were voluntary, but once they were made, it was obligatory to keep them.\n\n
5:7	idm79730					 **Fear God:** Reverence for God is the foundation for worthwhile words and useful activities (see *12:1*; *Prov 1:7*).\n\n
5:8	idm79739					 **For every official is under orders from higher up, and matters of justice get lost in red tape and bureaucracy. Even the king milks the land for his own profit!** Or *For one official watches over another, and higher officials are over them.* *The land benefits from a king who cultivates the field.* The NLT understands these verses to mean that bureaucracy brings oppression rather than justice, all the way up to the king (see also *1 Sam 8:11-18*). This should not be surprising because that is how bureaucracies tend to function. Others interpret the verses along the lines of the alternate translation above: The king and his officials provide oversight to restrain injustice and oppression. The former view is more in keeping with the realistic perspective of the Teacher.\n\n
5:10	idm79749					 Because we are created as spiritual and not just physical beings, possessions and **wealth** can never completely satisfy us.\n\n
5:12	idm79756					 **People who work hard sleep well:** Hard work and moderation yield the formula for a peaceful, productive life. Pursuing wealth leads to unnecessary anxieties (*5:3*).\n\n
5:13	idm79764					 **Hoarding riches . . . everything is lost:** Possessions are transitory and can be lost for any number of reasons.\n\n
5:16	idm79771					 Working simply to gain possessions is **like working for the wind***;* it leads to being **frustrated, discouraged, and angry**.\n\n
5:18	idm79780					 The prescription for enjoying life is repeated: We should enjoy our food, drink, and work and appreciate them as gifts from God.\n\n
6:1	idm79786					 This “unfortunate man” parable resembles *4:7-8* and *5:13-17*. It is **a sickening tragedy** when someone succeeds but then cannot **enjoy these things**. Such a person has missed out on the only available benefit of success.\n\n
6:3	idm79796					 **a hundred children and . . . be very old:** Such honors as virility and old age amount to nothing if life is not enjoyable or does not end well (**a decent burial**). The **darkness** of being **born dead** is preferable to a discontented life.\n\n
6:7	idm79806					 People never seem to be satisfied with what they have, no matter how much it is (cp. *5:10*).\n\n
6:8	idm79813					 **are wise people really better off . . . being wise?** Yes, as long as they **enjoy** and are content with what the Lord has provided.\n\n
6:10	idm79821					 God’s sovereign rule over **everything** is sobering, but it is ultimately a source of hope.\n\n
6:10	idm79828					 **Everything has already been decided:** Cp. *Rom 8:29*; *Eph 1:5*, *11*. • **It was known long ago what each person would be:** Cp. *Ps 139:15-16*. • **no use arguing with God about your destiny:** Cp. *Rom 9:20-24*.\n\n
6:11	idm79842					 **more words . . . the less they mean:** Cp. *Prov 10:19*; *17:28*.\n\n
6:12	idm79851					 **who knows? Who can tell?** These questions have already been answered. Our **days can best be spent** in wise living and in enjoying our work and God’s gifts (*2:13-14*, *24*; *3:22*; *5:18*). **What will happen on this earth** is what has already happened (*1:9*, *10*; *3:15*). • **like a shadow:** Cp. *Pss 39:4-6*; *90:3-6*, *10-12*; *109:23*; *144:4*.\n\n
7:1	idm79873					 These proverbs are similar to the sayings in the book of Proverbs.\n\n
7:1	idm79879					 The effort to pursue luxuries such as **costly perfume** is better spent seeking a **good reputation** for wisdom and righteousness (*Prov 22:1*; *28:6*). • **the day you die is better than the day you are born:** There is a sense of relief when the troubles of life are over. The difficulties of life can make one look forward to the peace of death (*Eccl 1:18*; *2:22*; *4:2-3*; *12:1*).\n\n
7:2	idm79894					 Frivolous merry-making is foolish when wisdom demands sobriety about death (see also *2:12-13*).\n\n
7:3	idm79901					 **refining influence:** Thinking soberly **about death** leads us to see the severity of God’s curse on sin and convinces us of the need to enjoy life wisely (*9:10*).\n\n
7:5	idm79910					 Being **praised by a fool** and enjoying **a fool’s laughter** are short-lived and worthless. Being **criticized by a wise person** can lead to real gain (*Prov 17:10*).\n\n
7:8	idm79920					 **Finishing** a project by exercising **patience** is **better than starting** a project with the **pride** of boastful words.\n\n
7:9	idm79930					 **anger labels you a fool:** Cp. *Prov 14:29*; *29:11*; see “*Anger*” Theme Note.\n\n
7:11	idm79940					 **Wisdom** and **money** are powerful means to bring us **benefit**. • **but only wisdom can save your life:** See *7:17*; *Prov 10:2*; *11:4*.\n\n
7:13	idm79953					 God’s sovereign acts are irresistible; it is useless to counter or avoid his purposes.\n\n
7:14	idm79959					 Enjoying **prosperity** is beneficial, but such gifts are fleeting. The wise person accepts God’s sovereign hand in everything (cp. *Phil 4:11-13*).\n\n
7:16	idm79967					 However hard we work, we could always do more, and we can **destroy** ourselves in the process.\n\n
7:17	idm79974					 **don’t be too wicked either:** Wicked foolishness can lead to an early death (e.g., *1 Sam 25*).\n\n
7:19	idm79982					 **One wise person:** E.g., see *9:14-15*; *2 Sam 20:15-22*.\n\n
7:20	idm79991					 **Not a single person . . . always good and never sins:** Cp. *1 Kgs 8:46*; *Prov 20:9*; *Rom 3:23*.\n\n
7:22	idm80001					 It is right to forgive and be gracious toward others’ indiscretions or slips of the tongue.\n\n
7:23	idm80007					 **it didn’t work:** The Teacher was not able to **find** the **wisdom** that he sought or **the reason for things**. Such reasons are hidden in the mind of God (*3:11*; *8:17*).\n\n
7:26	idm80019					 **a seductive woman:** Cp. *Prov 5*; *6:20–7:27*.\n\n
7:28	idm80028					 The NLT adds the phrase **is virtuous** (based on *7:29*) to give the sense of the verse. Virtue is extremely rare: In his own experience, the Teacher found only a few men, and no women, with that quality.\n\n
7:29	idm80036					 After much searching, the Teacher **did find** that humanity’s **downward path** from God’s created order (*Gen 1:27-28*; *2:23-25*; *3:1-19*) was repeated by Adam and Eve’s descendants (cp. *Rom 3:10-18*, *23*).\n\n
8:1	idm80049					 **softening its harshness:** Anxiety, anger, sorrow, and frustration can harden one’s face, but the enjoyment of life and wisdom will lighten it.\n\n
8:2	idm80056					 **since you vowed to God that you would:** Cp. *5:2-6*; *1 Kgs 2:41-43*.\n\n
8:3	idm80065					 Plotting against the **king** is futile because he has **great power** and can **do whatever he wants**.\n\n
8:6	idm80074					 **there is a time . . . for everything:** Those who are wise will be ready when an opportune time appears (see *3:1-8*; *Eph 5:16*).\n\n
8:7	idm80083					 Since our strength, goodness, and wisdom cannot forestall calamity, turning to **wickedness** would **certainly** be futile.\n\n
8:9	idm80091					 In this world, injustice often prevails. The apparent success of the **wicked** can be frustrating.\n\n
8:12	idm80098					 Injustice is momentary and does not upset God’s plans for justice (*3:16-17*; *12:14*). In reality, wickedness does not pay.\n\n
8:15	idm80106					 The Teacher’s conclusion is familiar (*2:24-25*; *3:12-13*, *22*; *5:18-20*; *6:9*). In spite of tragedies and hard labor, we can enjoy life and be happy. • In Hebrew, the word translated **having fun** means finding enjoyment in our daily activities, not pursuing pleasure or entertainment for its own sake.\n\n
8:16	idm80118					 Another generalization from lifelong observation is that death appears to be meaningless. Why do some die and others live longer? God’s sovereign decision in this matter is unpredictable (*7:13-14*).\n\n
8:16	idm80125					 A person could spend night and day looking for the answers to every question, but the reasons for **everything** will not be apparent. God’s justice, for example, is sometimes mysterious.\n\n
9:1	idm80132					 **No one knows whether God will show them favor:** There is no guarantee that righteousness will be rewarded in this life (cp. *3:17-22*; *8:10-15*; *12:14*).\n\n
9:2	idm80142					 The **destiny** all people share is death.\n\n
9:3	idm80149					 When punishments, including death, are delayed, people continue **their own mad course***,* perhaps intensifying their sin and foolishness.\n\n
9:4	idm80157					 The hope for enjoyment is only as alive as the one who is hoping. In this sense, it is better to be alive (cp. *6:3*; *7:1*).\n\n
9:7	idm80165					 Though death is inevitable, enjoying life is beneficial.\n\n
9:10	idm80171					 **to the grave:** Hebrew *to Sheol.* In the Old Testament, Sheol is the abode of the dead. It is not necessarily associated with punishment.\n\n
9:11	idm80179					 **decided by chance:** We cannot control the outcome (cp. *7:13*).\n\n
9:13	idm80187					 This poor man’s particular wise action was effective. Wisdom is better than power, strength, or weapons (see *4:13*; *7:9*, *19*; *10:4*), yet the worthy are not always honored, and even the wise are forgotten (see *2:16*; *4:16*).\n\n
9:18	idm80199					 **one sinner can destroy . . . a little foolishness spoils:** Sin and foolishness can undo a lot of good in a very short time.\n\n
10:2	idm80206					 These two proverbs show the stupidity of **fools**. They choose wrongly, and everything they do shows that they are foolish.\n\n
10:4	idm80213					 A **boss** can be anyone in authority.\n\n
10:5	idm80220					 The unjust and destructive delegation of **authority** to those incapable of using it wisely is a **grave mistake**. Favoritism, nepotism, extortion, and bribery can place the most reckless fools in the most powerful positions.\n\n
10:7	idm80228					 **servants riding . . . princes walking:** Cp. *Prov 19:10*.\n\n
10:8	idm80236					 Every activity requires wisdom. Wisdom is evident in the safety precautions taken by those engaged in every profession, yet there is always a degree of risk.\n\n
10:10	idm80242					 **wisdom . . . helps you succeed:** In all occupations, there are tools that must be kept in good order to be most efficient. Simply sharpening the blade of **a dull ax** can be a significant act of wisdom for those whose livelihood depends on it.\n\n
10:11	idm80250					 One purpose of charming a **snake** is to keep it from biting, but a **snake charmer** risks being bitten before it is charmed. Some occupations are so hazardous that the wise do not engage in them at all.\n\n
10:12	idm80258					 **Fools are destroyed by** such things as foolish promises, getting caught in false testimony, and making the wrong people angry (see *5:6*; *Prov 17:20*; *18:6-7*; *19:5*, *9*).\n\n
10:14	idm80270					 **they chatter on and on:** Fools are always talking about nothing (see *5:3*; *6:11*; *Prov 10:19*; *17:28*). • **no one can predict the future:** The wise will not waste time in foolish talking nor suffer its consequences (see *Jas 4:13-16*).\n\n
10:15	idm80283					 The audience for this speech might have been an assembly of government workers. How should one rule when power and wealth invite a lack of accountability?\n\n
10:15	idm80289					 **Fools** are so unaccustomed to **work** that when they actually try to work, they become **exhausted**.\n\n
10:16	idm80298					 **A servant** lacks leadership skills. • **feast at the proper time:** Wise **leaders** take their leisure only after the work is finished, not **in the morning** before work has even started. Lazy leaders weaken a society or organization.\n\n
10:18	idm80308					 Delay in repairing a **roof** leads to drooping rafters and eventually to the ruin of the home (see *Prov 12:27*; *20:4*). Corruption in government has a similar effect (*Eccl 10:15-16*).\n\n
10:19	idm80318					 **money gives everything:** It is the way to get what you want or need in this world (cp. *7:11-12*).\n\n
10:20	idm80326					 It is often a mystery how someone knows what we have said. The best way to control our reputation is to control our **thoughts**.\n\n
11:1	idm80333					 All profitable activity involves risk. We must act as wisely as we can and trust God for the result.\n\n
11:1	idm80339					 We should invest rather than hoard our resources, even if we cannot control the results.\n\n
11:3	idm80345					 **clouds . . . rains:** Sometimes we can be reasonably certain of what will happen. • **a tree . . . stays where it falls:** Our actions sometimes yield irrevocable consequences.\n\n
11:5	idm80353					 **The activity of God** is often unpredictable and mysterious. Our job is to work when we have the opportunity to do so (see *Prov 12:11*; *24:27*).\n\n
11:9	idm80362					 **Young people** are encouraged to enjoy their youth to the fullest. They should also **remember** that they will **give an account to God** and should therefore avoid foolish behavior.\n\n
11:10	idm80371					 **Youth***,* like life itself, is beneficial and enjoyable but ultimately **meaningless***,* a fleeting vapor that passes away without apparent significance or lasting purpose.\n\n
12:1	idm80381					 This beautiful prose poem, which uses many metaphors in Hebrew, describes the torturous deterioration of aging (in continuation of *11:7-10*).\n\n
12:1	idm80388					 **Don’t . . . forget your Creator:** Reverence for God can give wisdom (*Prov 1:7*) and guidance as to what will be beneficial in this life and pleasing to God at the judgment (*Eccl 12:13-14*). It is better to **remember** God when young, when wisdom can make a real difference in life’s results.\n\n
12:3	idm80398					 The NLT translates the Hebrew metaphors (**guards . . . strong men . . . servants . . . women**) and also provides an interpretation of these poetic elements (**legs . . . shoulders . . . teeth . . . eyes**).\n\n
12:5	idm80406					 The **caperberry** was well known in the ancient Near East as an aphrodisiac.\n\n
12:6	idm80413					  The **silver cord** and the **golden bowl***,* like human life, are very valuable. • The body is like a common earthen **jar** that is fragile and soon broken (cp. *Isa 29:16*; *Jer 19:1*, *10-11*; *22:28*; *2 Cor 4:7*).\n\n
12:7	idm80428					 **the dust will return to the earth:** See *Gen 2:7*; *3:19*. • That **the spirit will return to God who gave it** hints at belief in an afterlife (cp. *Eccl 3:21*; see “*The Afterlife*” Theme Note).\n\n
12:8	idm80440					 This nearly verbatim repetition of *1:2* sums up the Teacher’s conclusion.\n\n
12:9	idm80447					 This coda by the editor (see “Author and Recipients” in the *Book Introduction*) expresses the editor’s respect for the Teacher, exhorts readers to apply his teaching, and gives the editor’s own conclusion from studying the Teacher (*12:13-14*).\n\n
12:9	idm80455					 Even as king (*1:1*), the Teacher found time to study wisdom. He collected and arranged proverbs (see also *1 Kgs 4:29-34*; *Prov 1:1*; *10:1*; *25:1*).\n\n
12:11	idm80466					 **cattle prods . . . nail-studded stick:** Painful lessons are sometimes required to direct us into paths that we would rather not take. • **a shepherd:** This word is possibly an allusion to God as the shepherd of his people (*Ps 23:1*; *Isa 40:11*). The sentence might also just be comparing **the words of the wise** to the work that any shepherd does in taking care of his flock.\n\n
12:12	idm80477					 A moderate approach to writing and studying wisdom leaves enough time to apply it and enjoy its fruits.\n\n
12:13	idm80483					 The editor’s **conclusion** from studying the Teacher’s work is to **fear God** (see *3:14*; *5:7*; *7:18*; *8:12-13*), which includes the need to **obey his commands***,* because everything we do will be judged (see *11:9*; *2 Cor 5:10*; *Heb 9:27*).\n\n
