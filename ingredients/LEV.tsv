1:1	idm12303					 The first major section of Leviticus deals with the institution of the sacrificial system and the priesthood. The sacrifices were either for atonement (the whole burnt offering, sin offering, and guilt offering) or for worship (grain offering and peace offering). Each one taught theology through a hands-on approach. Priests were required to officiate in the sacrificial worship at the Tabernacle, to instruct God’s people in the revelation given to Moses at Sinai, and to represent the people before God, such as on the Day of Atonement (ch *16*). Priests were provided for by receiving a portion of the offerings.\n\n
1:1	idm12310					 **The** Lord** called to Moses from the Tabernacle:** Leviticus is part of the ongoing narrative of the Pentateuch (*Gen 1:1*—*Deut 34:12*). It is part of the history of God’s saving acts: God chose Israel to be his people, delivered them from slavery in Egypt, entered into a covenant relationship with them, and guided them through the desert to the Promised Land. Specifically, Leviticus picks up with events recorded in *Exod 40:34-38*, when construction of the Tabernacle is completed. It has been dedicated, and the Lord has filled it with his glory. Now the Lord gives Moses instructions for conducting worship at the Tabernacle. • The **Tabernacle** (literally *Tent of Meeting;* see *study note on Exod 27:21*) was an earthly representation of God’s palace. Inside the Most Holy Place, the Ark of the Covenant represented God’s throne (*Exod 40:1-33*). The Lord’s glory resided between the outstretched wings of the cherubim. There he would meet with Israel to communicate his will to them (see *Exod 25:22*).\n\n
1:2	idm12327					 **When:** This word introduces a major category (the process of presenting an offering), followed by a series of conditions introduced by **if** (*1:3*, *10*, *14*). This *when/if* pattern is generally followed through all the major offerings described in *1:2–6:7*. • **offering** (Hebrew *qorban**;* see *study note on Mark 7:11*) is a general term referring to all kinds of offerings and gifts, including the various offerings described in *Lev 1–7*.\n\n
1:3	idm12345					 **burnt offering** (Hebrew *‘olah**,* “what goes up”): The Hebrew word implies the ascent of **the animal** in flame and smoke. Except for its hide, given in payment to the officiating priest (*7:8*), this offering was burned completely on the altar (*1:9*). Its purpose was to satisfy God’s wrath against sin, ceremonially cleansing the worshiper and restoring him or her to fellowship with God (cp. *Rom 3:25*; *8:3*; *2 Cor 5:18-21*). The whole burnt offering occurs first in this list of offerings (*Lev 1–7*), providing a pattern for offerings that follow. It is the most common and most general atoning offering.\n\n
1:3	idm12361					 **male with no defects:** God allowed female and slightly deformed animals for certain types of non-atoning offerings (see *3:1*; *4:27-31*; *22:23*), but not for the whole burnt offering. In the dry, brush-encrusted hills of southern Palestine, cattle were much more difficult to raise than sheep or goats. This meant a bull without defect was an animal of great value. Centuries later, the prophet Malachi confronted the people for offering sick and lame animals instead of those without defect (*Mal 1:6-14*).\n\n
1:4	idm12372					 **Lay your hand on the animal’s head:** The sacrificial animal represented the worshiper in the ceremony (*4:4*, *15*, *24*, *29*, *33*; *16:21*). This act signified that the animal’s death represented the death of its owner. In the ritual for the Day of Atonement, it signified that the sins of the owner were transferred to the animal (*16:20-22*). With the peace offering (*3:2*, *8*, *13*), the act seems to have indicated ownership of the animal being sacrificed. • The phrase **in your place** may mean “in payment for sin” (sometimes called *expiation*) or “as a substitute for the sinner’s death” (sometimes called *propitiation*). • **to purify you, making you right with him** (or *to make atonement for you*): Although older commentaries describe this process as “covering over” sin, recent scholarship defines it as “blotting out, erasing, or cleansing from” sin. The concept involves satisfying God’s wrath against sin, ceremonially cleansing the worshiper, and restoring fellowship with God in the community of God’s people.\n\n
1:5	idm12394					 **Aaron’s sons:** The descendants of Levi, Moses’ own tribe, were divided into two categories: (1) priests, who were descendants of Aaron, the first high priest; and (2) Levites, who served in subordinate roles (*Exod 28:1-4*; *Num 18:1-7*). The instructions given here applied to later generations as well. • The **blood** was a symbol of life, not of death. The Israelite system of sacrifice was based on the principle of substitution, and the shedding of sacrificial blood was essential for atonement. It represented sacrificing the life of the animal as a substitute for the life of the worshiper (*Lev 17:10-14*; *Heb 9:22*). The blood of Jesus Christ was shed as the ultimate sacrifice for sin (*Heb 9:11-14*). • The **altar** of burnt offering was located in the east end of the courtyard, outside the Tabernacle but inside the entrance to the courtyard (*Exod 40:6*, *29*).\n\n
1:6	idm12410					 The entire animal was to be burned, except for the **skin***,* which was the priest’s share of the offering (*7:8*).\n\n
1:8	idm12419					 The Hebrew word translated **fat** describes the suet, or hard fat, from around the kidneys and loins. This specific term occurs only here and in *1:12* and *8:20*. All fat—not just this special fat—was considered God’s portion (*3:14-17*; *7:23-25*; see *1 Sam 2:15-17*). Only the whole burnt offering was entirely consumed on the altar. With other offerings, the fatty portions and certain internal organs were burned; the rest belonged to the officiating priests and sometimes to the worshiper (*Lev 7:11-18*).\n\n
1:9	idm12432					 The offering was **washed with water** to remove dirt or debris that might contaminate the offering. Washing was also part of purification from ritual uncleanness, a prerequisite for Tabernacle service (*6:27*; *11:28*). • **special gift:** The Hebrew term (*’isheh*) has traditionally been rendered “offering made by fire.” Although the offering was to be burned (*1:13*, *17*), recent scholarship suggests that the word had the more generic meaning of “gift.” • **pleasing aroma to the** Lord (literally *a restful odor;* also in *1:13*, *17*): Pagan people of the ancient Near East believed that their gods smelled the offerings because they needed to eat them to sustain their lives. Although God’s response is sometimes represented in language that reflects the cultural setting (e.g., *21:6*; *Num 28:2*), the Bible is clear that God did not need offerings as food (*Ps 50:9-13*). Instead, they pleased him as sincere offerings for the purpose of atonement.\n\n
1:10	idm12453					 Permission to offer lesser animals was to make the animal, and therefore atonement, more affordable to common Israelites. The method of offering these animals closely parallels the offering of bulls outlined in *1:3-9*.\n\n
1:14	idm12460					 Birds were plentiful, cheap, and easy to catch. This meant that atonement and worship through sacrifices were not only for the rich and privileged; the poor were also included (see also *5:7*; *12:8*; see *Luke 2:24*).\n\n
1:17	idm12469					 **tear . . . without tearing it apart:** Cutting larger animals into pieces (*1:6*, *12*) probably reflects the ancient rite of covenant-making, in which the participant passed between the two halves of a sacrificed animal (see *Gen 15:10*). Because of their small size, birds were not cut in half. If it was necessary to pass between them, they were arranged in pairs.\n\n
2:1	idm12479					 The **grain offering** (Hebrew *minkhah,* “gift, present”) was a way to express worship to the Lord through a gift, recognizing him as Lord over the life of the worshiper.  The grain offering was to accompany each whole burnt offering (*Num 28:3-6*, *12-13*), sin offering (*Num 6:14-15*), and peace offering (*Lev 9:4*; *Num 6:17*). The grain offering supplied the priest with bread for his daily sustenance, because no farmland was allocated to priests.\n\n
2:1	idm12492					 **Choice flour** was fine wheat flour (in contrast with common barley flour). See also *1 Kgs 4:22*; *Ezek 16:13*, *19*. • Israelites used **olive oil** as shortening in their cooking, as lamp fuel, and for medicinal and cosmetic purposes. Accordingly, it was associated with the rich produce of the land and with God’s provision (*Deut 8:8*). • Like choice flour, **frankincense** was frequently connected with the Tabernacle (*Exod 30:34*; *Lev 24:7*) or the Temple (*1 Chr 9:29*). This fragrant tree resin was also used by individuals on special occasions (*Song 3:6*; *Matt 2:11*). It was a primary ingredient of the holy incense burned in the Holy Place as a tangible expression of worship (*Exod 30:34-38*).\n\n
2:2	idm12511					 The **representative portion** of the grain offering was burned on the altar to remind the worshiper that the whole offering belonged to God.\n\n
2:3	idm12518					 **rest of the grain offering:** A portion of the fire offerings was generally reserved for the priest as food (see *6:16-17*). Exceptions included the whole burnt offering (the priest received only the hide; see *7:8*), offerings given by the priest for himself (*4:3-12*; *6:19-23*), or offerings made for the entire community (*4:13-21*). In these cases, the offering was to be entirely burned. The grain offering provided the priests with bread for their diet. • **most holy** (Hebrew *qodesh qodashim**,* “holy of holies”): Both God and what belongs to him are holy. “Most holy” designates the priestly share as taken from the holy offering and reserved for a special function. This description is used for the priest’s share of any gifts dedicated to the Lord (*Num 18:8-10*).\n\n
2:4	idm12534					 A large ceramic **oven** was placed in a hole, and around it a fire was kindled. Once the oven was hot, the flat bread baked against the inside of its wall. • **without any yeast:** See *study note on 2:11*; see also *Exod 12:8*.\n\n
2:5	idm12544					 A **griddle** was a flat stone or clay surface propped above a fire and heated. Later griddles were made of metal (*Ezek 4:3*).\n\n
2:7	idm12552					 Dough **prepared in a pan** was fried with **oil** until crisp.\n\n
2:11	idm12560					 **yeast:** The bread commonly eaten in biblical times was comparable to modern sourdough. The substance that is often called “leaven” consisted of wild yeast spores mixed into moist dough or a flour mixture. The yeast would grow and cause the dough to ferment, souring and raising it. A reserved portion of the sour dough would be kneaded into subsequent batches (*Matt 13:33*). Unleavened bread was required for the Passover (*Exod 12:8*), in remembrance of Israel’s bondage in Egypt (*Deut 16:3*) and their speedy departure from that land (*Exod 12:34*; *13:3*). Following the Exodus, unleavened bread acquired the status of altar bread. Leavened bread was not to be burned on the altar. • **honey:** The Hebrew word (*debash*) can also refer to fruit nectar. The reason for its exclusion is not stated, but perhaps the frequent use of honey in pagan offerings, particularly to gods of the underworld, was a contributing reason. If the word refers to fruit nectar, its association with wine and fermentation may have linked it with yeast, making it ineligible to be burned on the altar. However, both honey and yeast were allowed as part of an offering of first crops (*Lev 2:12*). Loaves of bread made with yeast were to be presented with thank offerings (*7:13*) and as a gift to the priest in the Festival of Harvest (*23:17*). In the New Testament, yeast becomes a spiritual metaphor, playing on its sour taste and on its tendency to spread (*Matt 16:6*, *11*, *12*; *1 Cor 5:6-8*; cp. *Matt 13:33*).\n\n
2:12	idm12582					 **offering of the first crops:** This offering (called “firstfruits” in many translations) was brought from the first part of the harvest (*23:15-21*; *Num 28:26-31*). Like the representative portion of the grain offering, this offering acknowledged that the entire harvest belonged to God (*Lev 23:10-11*; *Exod 22:29*; *23:19*; *34:26*; *Num 15:18-20*; *Deut 18:4-5*; *26:1-2*). It further recognized that the land itself, not just its products, belonged to God; Israel was merely the tenant (see *Lev 25:23*).\n\n
2:13	idm12599					 In ancient times, **salt** represented permanence because it preserved food. A covenant of salt (see study notes on *Num 18:19*; *2 Chr 13:5*) denoted an enduring covenant that was renewed with successive generations.\n\n
3:1	idm12608					 The **peace offering** (Hebrew *shelem*) expressed worship through fellowship with the Lord and with others. The Hebrew word is from the same root as *shalom**,* which speaks of wholeness, well-being, harmony, and peace. *Shalom* means more than a cessation of hostilities between God and the worshiper; it implies a bond of harmonious fellowship. The peace offering was therefore a shared meal celebrating fellowship with God and others (cp. *Exod 18:12*; *24:9-11*; *1 Sam 9:15-24*). It could be presented as an expression of thanks (*Lev 7:12-15*), as a voluntary offering, or in fulfillment of a vow (*7:16-18*; *22:21*). Peace offerings often followed whole burnt offerings (e.g., *1 Kgs 9:25*), showing that fellowship with God follows atonement. When we have experienced atonement through Christ, we are able to be at peace with God and with each other (see *Acts 2:42*; *10:36*; *Rom 5:1*; *1 Cor 10:16*; *11:17-34*; *2 Cor 5:18-21*).\n\n
3:1	idm12632					 **a male or a female:** The whole burnt offering allowed only the use of male animals because it made atonement (*1:3*, *10*). The less formal peace offering permitted both male and female animals (see also *4:28*, *32*). • **no defects:** The sacrificial animals had to be healthy. The only exception was the voluntary offering, for which a slight blemish was permissible (*22:23*).\n\n
3:4	idm12645					 **kidneys . . . lobe of the liver:** The Israelites saw the kidneys as organs of understanding, much like how we think of the brain (“I am overwhelmed [literally *my kidneys are consumed*],” *Job 19:27*; “heart,” *Pss 7:9*; *16:7*; *Jer 12:2*; *Lam 3:13*; “motives,” *Ps 26:2*; *Jer 17:10*; “thoughts,” *Jer 11:20*; *20:12*). The liver represented life and vitality, similar to how we think of the heart (*Prov 7:23*; “spirit,” *Lam 2:11*).\n\n
3:5	idm12664					 The **burnt offering** is described in *1:3-17* and is best referred to as the “whole burnt offering.” Because it was offered twice daily (see *Num 28:4*), and because the need for atonement preceded fellowship, the text assumes that the burnt offering would be on the altar already. The priest was to lay the fatty portions and certain internal organs (*3:3-4*) of the peace offering on top of it.\n\n
3:6	idm12674					 **Sheep** were smaller, easier to raise, and less expensive than cattle. Apart from the exceptions mentioned in these verses, offerings of sheep followed the same pattern as those of cattle.\n\n
3:9	idm12681					 **broad tail:** Sheep in this part of the ancient Near East had broad, fatty tails that were burned on the altar with the rest of the fat.\n\n
3:11	idm12688					 **special gift:** See *study note on 1:9*. • Offerings of **food** were called “God’s food” (*21:6*, *8*, *17*, *21*, *22*; *Num 28:2*). However, Scripture is clear that the Lord did not eat the offerings, as pagans believed their deities did (*Ps 50:9-13*). Instead, these offerings belonged to God, and the priest ate a portion of this food as God’s representative (*Lev 21:21-22*). These offerings sustained the priest and his family.\n\n
3:12	idm12705					 The offering of goats followed a similar pattern as for cattle and sheep. Both goats and sheep were considered offerings from the flock (see *3:6*).\n\n
3:17	idm12712					 Human beings were not permitted to eat the **fat or blood** (see *1:5*, *8* and *study notes*).\n\n
4:1	idm12722					 The **sin offering** (Hebrew *khatta’t**,* from the root *khata’,* meaning “to lack, fall short, miss, fail”) was for specific unintentional violations of God’s commands (see also *Num 15:22-29*), intended to repair a loss or remedy a failure (e.g., *Lev 5:1-4*). Although we all sin, God will forgive us if we confess it (*Gal 6:1*; *1 Jn 1:8-9*). But we are warned against sinning “brazenly” or “deliberately” (*Num 15:30-31*; *Heb 6:4-6*; *10:26-29*).\n\n
4:3	idm12739					 These verses distinguish two types of sin offerings: (1) the offering given for the sin of the **high priest** (*4:3*, *20*) and **the entire Israelite community** (*4:13*), and (2) the offering given for **one of Israel’s leaders** (*4:22*) and **any of the common people** (*4:27*). The former case required offering a bull, a large, expensive animal. It was not to be eaten (*6:30*) but was completely burned (*4:12*, *21*), and some of its blood was presented in the Holy Place (*4:6-7*, *17-18*). The latter case required a lesser animal—a male goat for a lay leader or a female sheep or goat for a common person. The priest ate a portion of the layperson’s offering (*6:24-29*), and the blood was presented at the bronze altar in the courtyard (*4:25*, *30*). The distinction stresses the responsibilities of leaders. The offering was the same for the priest as for the entire people, and the lay leader’s offering was more than that of a common person. The New Testament also emphasizes the responsibility of religious leaders; those who teach (*Jas 3:1*) and those who serve as religious leaders (*Matt 23:1-33*; *Luke 20:47*) are judged more severely than those who follow them.\n\n
4:3	idm12765					 The **high priest** was designated by God and “anointed” (Hebrew *mashiakh**,* “set apart by the ritual of anointing”) for a particular service. In *1 Sam 1:1—2 Kgs 25:30*, anointing most often refers to Israel’s king (see *1 Sam 24:6*; *2 Sam 1:14*; *19:21*). While all priests were anointed (*Exod 40:13-15*), here the term probably refers to the high priest because he was specially anointed for service in the Tabernacle (*Lev 6:20*; *8:12*). Since the high priest was mediator for all of Israel, including lesser priests, his sin would bring guilt on the entire assembly (see “*Community Identity*” Theme Note). • **Guilt** results from violating God’s will; it is not just perceived or psychological guilt (see *study note on 5:17-19*).\n\n
4:5	idm12784					 The **Tabernacle** complex had a tent (sometimes called the “Tent of Meeting”; see *study note on 1:1*) at the west end of the courtyard. Inside the tent, the **inner curtain** divided the first room, the Holy Place, from the second, the Most Holy Place. The Most Holy Place contained the Ark of the Covenant (*Exod 26:31-33*) and was God’s throne room (see *study note on Lev 1:1*). Sprinkling the animal’s **blood** before the curtain (*4:6*, *17*) and applying it to the horns of the incense altar (*4:7*, *18*) was done to atone for the anointed priest or for the entire congregation. This action demonstrated the gravity of the offenses being atoned for (cp. *4:25*, *30-35*).\n\n
4:7	idm12802					 The **altar for fragrant incense** stood in front of the inner curtain, just outside the Most Holy Place (*4:6*). It had four protrusions resembling **horns,** as did the altar for burnt offerings (see *study note on Exod 27:2*). The priests burned incense on this altar to the Lord each morning and evening (*Exod 30:1-10*).\n\n
4:11	idm12813					 Only the offerings for the priest or the entire community were burned **outside the camp.** Perhaps this was commanded because the offering had figuratively absorbed the contamination of the high priest or the community and therefore had to be disposed of outside the camp. Those guilty were not to partake of or reap any benefit from their own sin offerings, even if they were priests (*6:19-23*).\n\n
4:15	idm12821					 The Hebrew term for **elders** is related to the word for beard. It implies mature but not necessarily elderly individuals. They were leaders of the community—typically, heads of families and tribes (cp. *Exod 18:21-26*; *Deut 22:15-19*). For this offering, the elders represented the entire people, as they would later in anointing David as king (*2 Sam 5:3*).\n\n
4:20	idm12831					 A similar form of the phrase **they will be forgiven** appears frequently in passages dealing with atonement (*4:26*, *31*, *35*; *5:10*, *13*, *16*, *18*; *6:7*; *19:22*; *Num 15:25*, *26*, *28*). God is willing to forgive a repentant person’s sin and restore him or her to the community of faith.\n\n
4:22	idm12850					 The sin offerings described in this passage atoned for laypersons, whether leaders or other Israelite citizens. These offerings could be eaten (contrast *4:3-21*), and they involved lesser animals. The blood of the offering was disposed of in the courtyard of the Tabernacle and not carried to the Holy Place. As with the peace offering (ch *3*), the fat and certain internal organs were burned on the altar. However, the rest of the meat from these offerings was given to the priest as food for himself and the males in his family (*6:29*), and it was to be eaten in a holy place (*6:26*; cp. *10:16-20*). A lay leader was to offer a male goat (*4:23*), while a common layperson could offer a female goat or lamb. The animal’s lesser size and cost reflected the lesser influence of the common Israelite and, probably, their financial situation. Economic considerations allowed those who were poor to bring a pair of doves or young pigeons (*5:7-8*; *12:6*, *8*; cp. *Luke 2:24*). The desperately poor could offer two quarts of flour (*Lev 5:11*).\n\n
4:22	idm12867					 **Israel’s leaders** included the elders (see *4:15*), tribal heads, and family heads (see *Num 1:16*, *44*; *1 Kgs 8:1*).\n\n
4:23	idm12878					 The **male goat** offered by a lay leader was a lesser offering than was required for the priest (a bull) but more than was required for a common person (*4:28*, *32*). However, like all offerings used for securing atonement, the animal could have no **defects** (see *1:3*).\n\n
4:24	idm12889					 **at the place where burnt offerings are slaughtered:** See *1:3-5*.\n\n
4:25	idm12897					 **blood . . . horns of the altar:** Unlike the blood of the bull for the priest, the blood of the offering of a leader (*4:25*) or a common Israelite (*4:30*, *34*) was not to be carried into the Holy Place. Also, a portion of the meat was to be eaten by the priest who offered it (*6:24-29*).\n\n
4:27	idm12908					 The **common people,** who had less responsibility than a priest or leader, were permitted the lesser offering of a **female** sheep or goat. A greater position brings greater responsibility (cp. *Amos 3:2*; *Matt 25:14-30*; *Jas 3:1*).\n\n
5:1	idm12919					 These verses list examples of sins covered by the sin offering (*4:2*). When a person realized he or she had committed an offense, the next step was to make it right by admitting guilt and bringing a sin offering.\n\n
5:1	idm12926					 The first infraction was the failure **to testify** when called as a witness before a court. Failure to testify was not a passive act because it actively aided the criminal. • **you will be punished** (literally *you become guilty* or* you realize your guilt*): Anticipating God’s punishment for the sin, the guilty party offered the sacrifice to remove the guilt and escape the punishment.\n\n
5:2	idm12936					 **ceremonially unclean:** “Clean” and “unclean” did not pertain to hygiene (see *11:1–15:33*) but to suitability for participating in worship or, in the case of animals, suitability for sacrifice or human consumption. A list of clean and unclean animals is found in *11:1-47*. The requirement for becoming clean after touching an unclean animal was merely to wash one’s clothes and remain apart from the community until evening (*11:25*). Most likely, therefore, the requirement of this sin offering indicates that the person had failed to follow the prescription for cleansing (*11:27-28*).\n\n
5:3	idm12947					 Any bodily discharge, even blood, would render a person temporarily **unclean** (chs *11–15*). The uncleanness itself was not sin, but it was a sin to neglect the uncleanness, allowing it to spread. Once people became aware of their unclean state, they were guilty if they neglected it.\n\n
5:4	idm12955					 Oaths could be taken in the name of the Lord. However, a **foolish vow,** one thoughtlessly made, was a blasphemous misuse of the Lord’s name (*Exod 20:7*). Accordingly, vows must be fulfilled (see *Num 30:2*; *Deut 23:21-23*; *Eccl 5:4-6*).\n\n
5:5	idm12966					 **When you become aware of your guilt:** All the situations that required a sin offering assumed guilt by accident or ignorance. As soon as a person became aware of having done something improper, he or she became guilty and was required to attend to it. Known sins were to be dealt with; it was a sin in itself to know what was right and not do it (see *5:17*; *Jas 4:17*). • **confess:** Sacrifice for sin without admission of guilt would be a meaningless ritual. When the sacrificial animal was presented to the priest, the worshiper likely told the priest why it was being offered.\n\n
5:6	idm12976					 The **penalty** was apparently fulfilled by the required sacrifice (see *study note on 4:1–5:13*). • The actions described in *5:1-5* best fit those of a layperson, so a **female** offering was permitted, in keeping with the principle demonstrated in *4:28*, *32*.\n\n
5:7	idm12988					 The poor also needed to secure atonement and reconciliation. Birds (*5:7*) were permitted for those too poor to afford a lamb (cp. *1:14-17*). Although an animal offering was typically required for atonement (*17:11*), God in his grace allowed the bloodless offering of flour if the worshiper could not even afford two birds (*5:11*).\n\n
5:7	idm12998					 The sin offerings included both a portion as a burnt offering and a portion that was first offered, then given to the priests (cp. *4:22-35*; *6:24-30*). Because of their small size, two birds were required—one for each type of offering.\n\n
5:11	idm13006					 The sin offering was not to be adorned with **olive oil or . . . frankincense.** These were required for the grain offering, which was the individual’s gift to the Lord (see *2:1*), given to express worship. The sin offering made atonement; its purpose was to obtain forgiveness, requiring that the offering be completely unadorned.\n\n
5:13	idm13014					 **making them right:** See study notes on *1:4*; *4:20*. • **rest of the flour:** See *study note on 2:3*.\n\n
5:14	idm13025					 The **guilt offering** (Hebrew *’asham**,* “guilt”) dealt with property loss and damages, whether sacred (*5:14-16*) or secular (*6:1-7*). It involved restitution as well as compensation for the loss (*5:16*; *6:5*). It could be called a “penalty offering,” because the ram was a penalty, or perhaps a “restitution offering,” because of the need to make restitution for the loss before the ram was offered. In the guilt offering (*5:14–6:7*), the loss involved was not only a failure in God’s sight, as with the sin offering, but also a loss of property to another person or to the sanctuary. Cp. *Matt 5:23-24*.\n\n
5:15	idm13040					 **unintentionally defiling:** Damage to sacred property was distinguished from damage to secular property. The sacrifice was effective only if the damage to sacred property had been committed accidentally. Deliberate damage, such as vandalism, to something sacred was blasphemous. As with other deliberate sins (*Num 15:30-31*), no means was specified for its atonement. No devout believer would defiantly continue in sin (see *1 Jn 3:9*). • The **sanctuary shekel** was not a coin but a standardized unit for measuring weight. It was used to evaluate the ram being offered. Some scholars suggest that this text permits the substitution of the appropriate amount of silver for the ram.\n\n
5:16	idm13050					 The surcharge of **an additional 20 percent** provided compensation to the owner for loss or damage to property. The surcharge for sacred property was paid directly to the priests. Accidental damage to sacred property occurred when a person unintentionally ate the sacred offerings (*22:14*) or omitted the tithe (*27:31*). A similar surcharge was involved in redeeming an animal (*27:13*, *27*).\n\n
5:17	idm13061					 This paragraph provides general principles for the guilt offering. Even if **unaware** of the infraction, an individual was **guilty** and had to provide the appropriate **guilt offering.** This applied to both sacred and secular property (*5:14-16*; *6:1-7*).\n\n
6:2	idm13072					 **sins against your associate . . . unfaithful to the **Lord**:** For believers, there really is no such thing as a “secular” sin. All sin involves God, even sin directed against another person or group. In the sins requiring a guilt offering, God’s forgiveness was needed, but restitution to the injured individual had to be made first (*6:5-7*; cp. *Matt 5:23-24*). Unlike offenses against sacred property (*Lev 5:14-16*), both accidental and intentional offenses against secular property could be forgiven.\n\n
6:5	idm13084					 The instructions for the guilt offering assumed that a person’s conscience would induce voluntary reparation; when restitution was voluntary, the surcharge for loss of use to the owner was always **20 percent.** Penalties were more severe in other cases (cp. *Exod 22:1-15*). There is a clear difference between voluntary confession and simply admitting sin after being caught.\n\n
6:7	idm13092					 **will purify you before the** Lord**, making you right with him:** God graciously gave his people a way to atone for their sins. See also study notes on *1:4*; *4:20*.\n\n
6:8	idm13103					 The regulations in *1:2–6:7* include instructions for both priest and layperson. This section adds detail regarding the rights and obligations of the officiating priest. Because the tribe of Levi had been allotted no land for farming (*Deut 18:1*; *Josh 13:14*, *33*), priests depended on the offering system for their income. The concern was that priests be adequately provided for. Like many human institutions, this system was eventually abused (*1 Sam 2:12-25*; *Hos 4:8*).\n\n
6:10	idm13115					 The priest was required to wear **official linen clothing,** the attire of his office, when officiating at the Tabernacle. This allowed everyone to know that he was there to carry out his official duties (*Exod 28:40-43*). The priest was to dress appropriately for service to the divine King. He was not to wear his official garb outside the Tabernacle (*Lev 6:11*; *Ezek 44:19*). • **undergarments:** See *Exod 20:26*.\n\n
6:11	idm13127					 Most natural environments qualified as a **place that is ceremonially clean.**\n\n
6:12	idm13134					 This passage cautions that **the fire on the** bronze **altar** must be constantly tended and **never** allowed to **go out***,* perhaps anticipating the tragedy of the “wrong kind of fire” offered by Nadab and Abihu (*10:1-2*).\n\n
6:16	idm13146					 In this context **sacred place** does not refer to the Holy Place at the heart of the Tabernacle but to any location within the Tabernacle complex, all of which were ceremonially clean and holy.\n\n
6:17	idm13153					 **yeast:** See *study note on 2:11*. • The priests’ **share** of the grain offering had the practical value of providing their staple food—bread (*7:9*)—in addition to its theological significance as being **most holy.** See *study note on 2:3*.\n\n
6:18	idm13165					 The priestly share did not belong exclusively to the priest conducting the sacrifice; it was to be shared with all **of Aaron’s male descendants**. The text does not indicate why these offerings could be eaten only by the males while other offerings were available to all members of the priests’ families (see *study note on 10:13-15*; see also *Num 18:20-24*). • **will become holy:** Or *must be holy;* also in *Lev 6:27*. Though uncleanness could be spread by touch (ch *15*), Haggai implied that holiness could not (*Hag 2:12*). If an unclean person encountered that which was holy, disaster could result (*Lev 10:1-3*; *1 Sam 6:19-20*; *2 Sam 6:6-8*).\n\n
6:19	idm13182					 These instructions applied only to the grain portion of the ordination offering (see *2:1-16*; for the rest of the ordination offering, see *8:22-32*).\n\n
6:22	idm13190					 Only the **high priest** could represent the priesthood as an institution, with all its constituent priests.\n\n
6:23	idm13197					 Normally, the bulk of a grain offering would go to the officiating priest (*2:9-10*). However, the grain offering described in *6:19-23* was for a special occasion—the ordination of the priests—and therefore was to be **burned up entirely** and not** eaten.**\n\n
6:28	idm13207					 A **clay pot** was porous and could not be cleansed as thoroughly as a metal one—some of the holy food might stick to it or soak in. Reuse would cause an act of sacrilege. However, a **bronze pot** could be thoroughly **scoured** to prevent this problem (see also *11:33*; *15:12*).\n\n
6:30	idm13218					 Some sin offerings for the anointed priest and for the entire congregation were not to be eaten. The blood of these offerings was carried into the Holy Place and sprinkled before the curtain (see *4:1-21*). The sacrifices that could be eaten were those for the lay leader and for the common people. The blood of these animals was poured on and around the base of the altar in the courtyard of the Tabernacle (see *4:22-35*).\n\n
7:3	idm13226					 The guilt offering required the sacrifice of a ram (*5:18*). • **fat . . . tail . . . organs:** The parts of the guilt offering to be burned were the same as those for the peace offering (*3:3-4*, *9-10*, *14-15*) and the sin offering (*4:8-9*, *26*, *31*, *35*).\n\n
7:12	idm13241					 The **peace offering** could be presented as an expression of thanks (as here), as payment of a vow (*7:16*), or as a voluntary offering (see *3:1-7*). A worshiper made it an **expression of thanksgiving** by presenting a grain offering along with the peace offering (*2:1-16*). A grain offering consisted of unleavened cakes, wafers, or cakes of fine flour, all mixed or spread with olive oil. A representative portion was set aside to be burned (*2:9*). The grain offering was to be accompanied by loaves of yeast bread (*7:13*).\n\n
7:15	idm13254					 The **thanksgiving** offering was given when the worshiper was thankful (*Jer 17:26*; *33:11*). The sacrifice was to be **eaten on the same day** it was offered so that the event would not fade from the worshiper’s memory.\n\n
7:16	idm13264					 In contrast to the “peace offering of thanksgiving,” which was presented as an expression of thanks to the Lord (*7:12-15*), the **offering to fulfill a vow** related to a vow made by a worshiper. The festive meal that followed was more relaxed and could extend into the next day. However, because the vow offering involved a vow made to God, it was still more restrictive than the voluntary offering, which could even use a deformed animal (*22:23*).\n\n
7:18	idm13273					 The Hebrew term for **contaminated** (*piggul*) occurs only in three other places (*19:7*; *Isa 65:4*; *Ezek 4:14*). It is always used in reference to meat that is unacceptable for sacrifice or human consumption.\n\n
7:19	idm13284					 Anything that was **ceremonially unclean** could not come into contact with what was holy (*7:20*). Although uncleanness was not sinful in itself, it symbolized what was unholy (see *Exod 19:10*).\n\n
7:20	idm13293					 **cut off:** Three interpretations are possible for this expression, all of them very grave: (1) The person was subject to God’s judgment and faced an early death by natural causes (*17:10-14*). (2) The person was to be executed by the community (cp. *Exod 31:14*). (3) The person lost communal membership in Israel, either by banishment (such as by excommunication) or by shunning the person and treating him or her as unclean (*Lev 18:24-30*; cp. *23:29-30*, where “cut off” seems distinct from “destroy”).\n\n
7:22	idm13304					 In the sacrificial system, the **fat** and **blood** of all altar offerings belonged to God. They were offered before any of the sacrifice could be eaten. Consuming blood was specifically forbidden because it represented the very life of the animal (*17:10-16*). The injunction against eating fat might have been because fat, considered to be the best part of the offering, belonged to God.\n\n
7:24	idm13313					 Animals **found dead** had not been drained of their blood and were therefore unclean. Their fat was unfit to offer to the Lord and could not be eaten. However, it could be **used for any other purpose***,* such as greasing cart axles, waterproofing animal hides, and other household uses.\n\n
7:26	idm13322					 The prohibition against consuming blood was so important that the Council at Jerusalem included it in the instructions for Gentile believers (*Acts 15:29*).\n\n
7:34	idm13329					 **breast of the special offering . . . right thigh of the sacred offering:** The peace offering was a shared meal between God, the priest, the worshiper, and guests. The breast (in some older translations called a “wave offering”) and thigh (sometimes called the “contribution” or “heave offering”) were specifically designated as the priest’s portion (see *10:13-15*). After these offerings were taken into the Tabernacle and presented before the Lord, they could then be eaten (see *Exod 29:24*, *26*).\n\n
7:36	idm13339					 **anointed:** See *8:12*, *30*; also *Exod 40:13-15*.\n\n
8:1	idm13349					 In *Exod 28–29*, the Lord gave Moses specific instructions for clothing and for ordaining Aaron and his sons as priests. In *Exod 39:1-31*; *40:12-16*; and *Lev 8*, the commands were carried out. Moses didn’t just pass along the instructions verbally; he enacted the rituals to provide an example for the priests down to the last detail, **just as the** Lord** had commanded him** (*8:9*, *13*, *17*, *21*, *29*). Because the penalty for disobedience was death, God made sure the priests knew exactly what to do.\n\n
8:2	idm13367					 These items are also mentioned in *Exod 29:1-3*, *7*. • **sacred garments:** See *Exod 28*. • The **anointing oil** consisted of special ingredients to give it a unique scent. These included myrrh, cinnamon, cane, and cassia (dried flowers from the cinnamon tree) mixed into olive oil (see *Exod 30:22-33*). • **bull for the sin offering:** See *Lev 4:3-12*. • The first of the **two rams** was to be a whole burnt offering (*8:18*), while the second was a special ordination sacrifice (*8:22*). • **basket of bread made without yeast:** See *6:19-23*.\n\n
8:4	idm13386					 The text repeatedly emphasizes that **Moses followed the** Lord**’s instructions,** obeying the commands given in *Exod 29* (see also *Lev 8:9*, *13*, *17*, *21*, *29*, *36*).\n\n
8:6	idm13402					 Being **washed . . . with water** was the first step for cleansing from impurity. The priests had to be ceremonially clean before they could serve the Lord in holiness (*Exod 29:4*; see *Ps 24:4*).\n\n
8:7	idm13411					 The **tunic** (see *Exod 28:39*) was woven of patterned linen cloth. • The same type of material used for the Tabernacle curtains was used for the embroidered **ephod** (see *Exod 28:4*, *6-14*). This garment’s precise shape and size are unclear, but it seems to have been a long, sleeveless vest, fitted close to the body and tied about the waist. It was joined at the shoulders by gold settings; each setting bore an onyx stone engraved with the names of six of the tribes of Israel (*Exod 28:9*). Later, an ephod also referred to a venerated image (*Judg 8:27*; *18:17*). • The **decorative sash** was embroidered and was made of the same materials as the ephod (see *Exod 28:8*).\n\n
8:8	idm13427					 The **chestpiece** (see *Exod 28:15-30*) was made of embroidered linen folded double. It bore twelve stones, each engraved with the name of a tribe of Israel. It was suspended over the heart by a gold chain from the gold shoulder-pieces of the ephod. • The **Urim and the Thummim** were placed in the pocket of the chestpiece (*Exod 28:30*; *1 Sam 23:9-12*; *30:7-8*); the precise function of these items is uncertain. They are generally thought of as two stones, perhaps each different in color, that were cast as lots. They apparently could give a positive, neutral, or negative answer to questions that could not otherwise be resolved (*Exod 28:30*; *Num 27:21*; *1 Sam 28:6*). Their mention in Old Testament prophetic literature written centuries later (*Ezra 2:63*; *Neh 7:65*) demonstrates how important these items were to the office of priest.\n\n
8:9	idm13444					 The **turban** worn by the high priest was made of linen and was distinct from the headdresses of the common priests (*Exod 28:40*). The **gold medallion** was suspended from the turban and bore an inscription that read, “Holy to the Lord” (*Exod 28:36*). With the names of the tribes on his shoulders and over his heart and the dedication to the Lord on his forehead, the high priest was clearly marked as the people’s representative to God and God’s representative to the people. In this mediating role, the high priest modeled the standard for all priests.\n\n
8:10	idm13455					 **making them holy:** God is the Holy One (*Pss 22:3*; *78:41*). In the strictest sense, only God can make a person or thing holy (*Lev 20:8*; *21:15*, *23*; *22:9*, *16*, *32*; *Exod 31:13*; see *Heb 2:11*); the actions of Moses simply recognized and declared what God had done (also in *Lev 8:11*, *12*, *15*).\n\n
8:13	idm13475					 For the attire of the common priests, see *Exod 28:40-41*.\n\n
8:14	idm13482					 **sin offering** (see *4:3-12*): Two atoning offerings were made—the sin offering (*8:14-17*) and the whole burnt offering (*8:18-21*). • By placing **their hands on the bull’s head** (see *1:4*), Aaron and his sons were identifying themselves with the sacrifice (also in *8:18*, *22*).\n\n
8:15	idm13496					 Normally, the high priest performed these priestly duties. However, it would not be proper for the priests to ordain themselves, so **Moses,** acting as God’s representative, instituted the priesthood.\n\n
8:18	idm13503					 **ram for the burnt offering:** See *study note on 1:10-13*.\n\n
8:22	idm13511					 **ram of ordination:** See *Exod 29:19-34*.\n\n
8:23	idm13519					 Aaron’s **[ear]lobe, thumb,** and **big toe** represented his total person. This act emphasized the role of the priestly office, with the blood stressing the ties to the sacrificial system. The priest’s basic function was mediation between God and his people. To do this effectively, he needed ears that could hear the words of God and the needs of his people, hands ready to do God’s bidding, and feet ready to take him where he was needed.\n\n
8:29	idm13527					 Moses functioned as a priest in the ordination ceremony and so received the priest’s **portion** of the offering (see *8:15*).\n\n
8:30	idm13535					 **anointing oil:** See *study note on 8:2*; see also *Ps 133:2*.\n\n
8:31	idm13544					 The ordination offering was a variation of the peace offering (*Exod 29:28*). It was a meal (*Lev 7:11-18*, *28-34*) shared between God (the parts burned on the altar) and the priests. The command to **boil . . . and eat** the ordination offering first appears in *Exod 29:32*.\n\n
8:34	idm13555					 **commanded by the** Lord**:** The details of the sacrifice rituals were symbolic and important in their own right. Yet most important, the priests were to obey God’s commands. Complete obedience to God is a major theme in both the Old Testament and the New Testament: “Obedience is better than sacrifice” (*1 Sam 15:22*).\n\n
8:35	idm13565					 **seven days:** This command emphasized God’s absolute holiness and mandated strict compliance with his commands. The priests, now anointed as God’s holy servants, were to remain in the Tabernacle court for **seven days** before venturing out into everyday life.\n\n
9:1	idm13573					 **eighth day:** The priests had finished the seven-day period of probation commanded in *8:35*. • **elders:** See *study note on 4:15*.\n\n
9:2	idm13583					 These sacrifices—the sin and whole burnt offerings for the priests and the sin, burnt, peace, and grain offerings for the people—were offered at the beginning of the priests’ ministry to make certain that all sin was atoned for and the covenant with God affirmed. Only the guilt offering was omitted.\n\n
9:6	idm13589					 Just as *holiness* describes God’s person and nature, the **glory of the** Lord tangibly expresses his power and majesty (see *Ezek 1:28*; *10:4*). His glory was revealed on Mount Sinai (*Exod 24:16*), at the dedication of the Tabernacle (*Exod 40:34-35*), and in Solomon’s Temple (*1 Kgs 8:11*; *2 Chr 7:1*). Yet it remained as vast as the heavens (*Ps 19:1*). The New Testament speaks of Christ’s glory as the image of God (*2 Cor 4:4*), who manifested God’s glory to the world (*John 1:14*). He was glorified in his death and resurrection (*John 17:1-5*). See also *Exod 24:15-17*.\n\n
9:7	idm13609					 **your sin offering . . . burnt offering:** Before the high priest could make atonement for the people, he had to be right with God himself.\n\n
9:9	idm13616					 Both Aaron, the high priest (*9:8*, *12*), and **his sons,** the common priests (*9:9*, *12*, *13*), participated in the sin offering (*9:8-11*) and the burnt offering (*9:12-14*). This made the atonement effective for the entire priesthood. • **horns of the altar:** See *study note on 4:25*; see also *Exod 27:1-8*.\n\n
9:17	idm13633					 **regular burnt offering for the morning:** A lamb was offered as a whole burnt offering each morning and evening (*6:9*; *Num 28:2-4*).\n\n
9:22	idm13642					 **blessed them:** See *Num 6:22-27*.\n\n
9:24	idm13650					 **Fire blazed forth from the** Lord**’s presence,** indicating that God had accepted the offerings, the atonement, and the priesthood (*9:7*; cp. *1 Kgs 18:36-38*).\n\n
10:1	idm13661					 A fire was to burn constantly on the bronze altar (*6:9*) to supply coals for burning incense (*16:12*). Perhaps careless from drinking wine (*10:8-11*), Nadab and Abihu took coals from another source. This violation of God’s instruction resulted in their deaths.\n\n
10:1	idm13670					 Aaron’s two older sons, **Nadab and Abihu** (*Exod 6:23*), had accompanied Moses and the seventy elders on Mount Sinai (*Exod 24:1*, *9*) and had witnessed the great theophany (appearance of God) there. They died without male heirs (see also *Exod 28:1*; *Num 3:2-4*; *26:60-61*; *1 Chr 6:3*; *24:1-2*). • The **incense burners** were fire pans or trays that held hot coals. Incense was sprinkled on them (*Exod 30:34-38*; see also *Lev 16:12-13*; *2 Chr 26:19*; *Rev 8:3-4*). • The **wrong kind of fire** (Hebrew *’esh zarah**,* “strange fire”) could mean “foreign,” and thus “unauthorized” (see *Exod 30:9*) or even “pagan” (as in *Ps 44:20*; *81:9*). Apparently, Nadab and Abihu used fire from a source not approved by God (*Num 3:4*; *26:61*), possibly even a pagan source. It is also possible that they offered incense not prepared according to God’s specifications (*Exod 30:34-38*), although the text does not mention that. They did not enter God’s presence on his terms but on their own.\n\n
10:2	idm13699					 In *9:24*, the **fire blazed forth** to show God’s acceptance. It now indicates his disapproval by bringing death to Nadab and Abihu, who had demonstrated a careless approach toward the worship of God (cp. *Acts 5:1-11*).\n\n
10:3	idm13708					 God’s **holiness** is his very essence, substance, and character, and it stands in contrast to the creaturely world. By performing this rash act, Nadab and Abihu failed to consider God’s holiness and failed to honor him.\n\n
10:4	idm13715					 **Mishael and Elzaphan . . . uncle Uzziel:** See *Exod 6:18*, *22*. • **carry away the bodies of your relatives:** Aaron, the high priest, and the priests Eleazar and Ithamar (*Lev 10:6*) could not defile themselves by making contact with a dead person (*21:10-12*).\n\n
10:5	idm13727					 Carrying the bodies **by their garments** avoided defilement.\n\n
10:6	idm13734					 **Eleazar and Ithamar** were Aaron’s two remaining sons (*Exod 6:23*). • **leaving your hair uncombed:** This practice and others like it were ways to **show grief** in biblical times (cp. *Gen 37:29*; *44:13*; *Deut 14:1*; *2 Sam 1:11*; *Job 1:20*; *Jer 16:6*; *47:5*). As high priest, Aaron was prohibited from participating in these rituals or in any way displaying his grief (*Lev 21:10*). The injunction extended to **Eleazar and Ithamar***;* if God’s representatives had shown grief on this occasion, it might have been interpreted by observers as disagreeing with God’s justice. However, the laypeople were allowed to mourn.\n\n
10:7	idm13754					 **must not leave:** Eleazar and Ithamar were not to attend the funeral. • **the** Lord**’s anointing oil:** Because they had recently been **anointed** as priests (see *7:36*), they were to avoid any association with the dead.\n\n
10:8	idm13766					 The placement of this instruction suggests that Nadab and Abihu were under the influence of alcohol when they offered “the wrong kind of fire” (*10:1*). Priests were not to drink anything that could impair their judgment before serving in the Tabernacle. • **the** Lord** said to Aaron:** God had been communicating only to Moses, but he now accepted Aaron as the people’s representative, and he communicated directly with Aaron as well. • The word **common** means “secular” or “ordinary.” • **ceremonially unclean . . . clean:** See *7:19-21*; *11:1–15:33*.\n\n
10:11	idm13780					 The **decrees that the** Lord** has given** were laws that came directly from God, rather than from a court decision.\n\n
10:12	idm13789					 The **grain offering** was part of the ordination ceremony (see *8:26*; *Exod 29:2*, *23*). • **no yeast, for it is most holy:** Realizing that some time had passed, Moses wanted to be certain that no fermentation had occurred in the priest’s portion of the grain offering (*Lev 6:14-18*).\n\n
10:13	idm13801					 The priest’s share of the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering was “most holy” (see *2:3*; *6:29*; *7:6*). Only the males in the priest’s family could eat it, and it had to be consumed in a holy place (that is, the Tabernacle court). The priest’s portion of the peace offering, though, was considered simply “holy.” It could be eaten by any family member in any clean place (*22:10-13*).\n\n
10:16	idm13811					 **The goat of the sin offering** was the offering for the people (*9:3*, *15-17*; cp. *9:2*, *8-11*). On this special occasion, its blood was not carried into the Holy Place as required. The remaining portion, after the portions allocated to God had been offered, should have been eaten by the priests (see *6:29*). But the goat was entirely burned, even though its blood had not been taken into the sanctuary (*10:18*; see *6:30*).\n\n
10:19	idm13825					 **yet this tragedy has happened to me:** Aaron was saying either that eating the goat of the sin offering would not have prevented the deaths of Nadab and Abihu or that it would not have been appropriate for him to eat it on the heels of such a grievous event.\n\n
11:1	idm13832					 These chapters detail the regulations pertaining to purity. The mixing of types of animals was forbidden (see *Deut 22:9-11*) because it represented a violation of the normal created order. “Abnormal” creatures—such as fish without fins and scales, carnivores, crawling insects, and animals without split hooves—cross boundaries between “normal” types and were unfit for food or offerings (see also *Deut 14:1-21*). The dietary laws were meant to distinguish Israel as a holy people from the surrounding nations (*Lev 11:44-45*).\n\n
11:2	idm13841					 Some scholars have suggested that unclean animals were to be avoided for reasons of public health, but the evidence does not support this. Horse meat, for example, is no less healthy than beef, yet it was considered unclean because the horse does not have a split hoof (see *11:2-3*). The regulations existed because an unclean animal was unacceptable as an offering to God and, therefore, it was also unacceptable as food for God’s people. Jesus proclaimed all foods clean for Christians (*Mark 7:14-19*; *Acts 10:9-16*).\n\n
11:2	idm13850					 **these . . . you may use for food:** Animals that have **split hooves** and chew the **cud** were considered “normal” and ceremonially clean (see also *Deut 14:3-21*).\n\n
11:5	idm13860					 Neither the **hyrax** nor the **hare** truly chews the cud, though both appear to. They are considered unclean because they do not have split hooves.\n\n
11:9	idm13868					 **marine animals:** Fish considered clean for the Israelites had both **fins and scales**.\n\n
11:10	idm13876					 The prohibition included fish such as eels and sharks that have **fins** but not **scales,** as well as crustaceans and mollusks, which have neither fins nor scales.\n\n
11:13	idm13884					 The list of unclean **birds** includes birds of prey and scavengers, both of which come in contact with dead animals and blood. This renders them unclean and unfit. Bats (*11:19*) fly, but are not birds; they are therefore “abnormal” and ceremonially unclean.\n\n
11:21	idm13892					 **insects that walk along the ground and have jointed legs:** This phrase eliminates creatures that creep or crawl low to the ground (*11:27*). *Leviticus 11:42* indicates that multi-legged creatures, such as centipedes, are unclean. **Locusts** and **grasshoppers** are examples of clean insects (see *Matt 3:4*).\n\n
11:24	idm13904					 **defiled until evening:** Anyone who touched a carcass of an unclean animal would be unclean until evening, which marked the beginning of the next day in Israel.\n\n
11:29	idm13911					 This list of unclean creatures that crawl contains both warm-blooded and cold-blooded animals that scurry along the ground. Snakes are also included in this category (*11:42*).\n\n
11:32	idm13918					 Dead animals could make things and people unclean. Even a clean animal that died without having its blood drained was considered unclean (*11:39-40*). When a person became unclean from contact with an animal’s carcass, it lasted only until evening. Household articles that came into contact with a carcass had to be purified (*11:25*, *28*, *32*, *40*) or destroyed (*11:33*, *35*).\n\n
11:36	idm13931					 A **cistern** was a hole dug into the ground or rock, often lined with plaster, that retained rain and surface water.\n\n
11:37	idm13938					 **Grain** moistened with water was probably intended to be cooked for food; eating contaminated grain would be like eating a carcass. However, if the grain was sown, the new plant and the grain it bore were undefiled.\n\n
11:39	idm13945					 Israelites were not to consume blood (*7:26*). They could eat an animal only after the blood had been drained and properly disposed of (*17:13*). The undrained blood of an otherwise clean animal that died of natural causes rendered it unclean. An Israelite was permitted to give or sell such an animal to foreigners (*Deut 14:21*) but not to eat it.\n\n
11:44	idm13954					 **I am the** Lord** your God:** See *study note on 18:2*. • **be holy, because I am holy:** These words express the dominant theme of Leviticus: God is holy. He must be regarded and treated as holy, and he expects holiness from his people (*10:3*; *19:2*). The profound teaching of this verse is that God’s own nature permeates those who covenant with him (see also *11:45*; *20:7*, *26*; *21:8*, *15*; *22:9*, *16*, *32*), and they become his holy people (*Exod 22:31*; *Deut 28:9*; cp. *1 Pet 1:16*).\n\n
11:45	idm13978					 **brought you up from the land of Egypt:** This or a similar phrase is found often throughout the Pentateuch (see *19:36*; *22:33*; *25:38*; *26:13*; *Exod 13:9*; *20:2*; *Num 15:41*; *Deut 4:37*). Each time, it reminds the Israelites, God’s covenant people, of God’s great act in liberating them from Egypt. The Exodus event is frequently commemorated elsewhere in the Old Testament (*Pss 80:8*; *106:21*; *Isa 11:16*; *Jer 34:13*; *Hos 12:9*; *13:4*; *Amos 2:10*).\n\n
12:1	idm14000					 These verses detail the regulations pertaining to childbirth. Any bodily discharge, even blood, was considered “abnormal” because it reduced the vitality of the individual and rendered the person ceremonially unclean (see study notes on *5:3*; *11:1–15:33*). Accordingly, not childbirth but the discharge accompanying it is addressed in these verses (*12:2*, *5*, *7*). The uncleanness was not sinful in itself, but only if it was neglected and allowed to come into contact with what is holy (see *5:2-3*).\n\n
12:2	idm14012					 **menstrual period:** See *15:19-24*.\n\n
12:3	idm14020					 By the **eighth day***,* a baby’s system has developed to a point where the blood can clot properly, rendering circumcision relatively safe.\n\n
12:4	idm14028					 These **thirty-three days** are added to the seven previous days (*12:2*, *3*) to yield a total of forty days to complete the mother’s period of purification.\n\n
12:5	idm14037					 **two weeks . . . sixty-six days:** The total is eighty days, double the time required for the birth of a son (see also *27:2-7*).\n\n
12:6	idm14045					 **purification offering:** The Hebrew word is the same as that for the sin offering (*khatta’t**,* see *study note on 4:1–5:13*). This leads some scholars to think that this offering dealt only with purification or decontamination, including those cases mentioned in *5:1-6*. The offering here was certainly part of a purification ritual, but it seems more likely that the sin offering repaired a lack or failure. In this context, the issue is purity rather than sin, and the focus is on restoring the woman to community fellowship, not forgiving a sinner.\n\n
12:7	idm14056					 **to purify her:** “Atonement” can be understood in this context to stress ceremonial cleansing and reconciliation of the worshiper (see *4:20*; see also *study note on 1:4*).\n\n
12:8	idm14065					 **cannot afford to bring a lamb:** The alternative offering provided for the poorer class of society (see *5:7-13*; cp. *Luke 2:22-24*).\n\n
13:1	idm14074					 Concerning the regulations pertaining to infections, the principle of normal and abnormal comes into play (see “*Clean, Unclean, and Holy*” Theme Note). Whether in a person, clothing, or a building, infections are not normal: They indicate disease and death, the antitheses of wholeness, and were therefore declared unclean.\n\n
13:1	idm14081					 **a serious skin disease** (Hebrew *tsara‘at*): The Hebrew word is much broader than the severely disfiguring Hansen’s disease (see *study note on 13:2*). This larger range included symptoms such as an open sore (*13:10*), a boil (*13:18*), a burn (*13:24*), a sore on the head or chin (*13:29*), shiny white patches (*13:38*), or abnormal baldness (*13:40*). A general test was whether or not the abnormality was spreading (*13:5-8*). If so, a quarantine was ordered for as long as the disorder persisted (*13:46*). Not just people, but clothing (*13:47-59*) and even buildings (*14:33-53*) could contract such infections.\n\n
13:2	idm14100					 Skin disorders that were potentially contagious, such as **swelling or a rash or discolored skin,** required precautions to arrest their spread. Until a disorder was healed, the person was deemed unclean. The diseases described in this section may range from something as simple as an allergic rash, ringworm, or eczema to something as serious as gangrene. In Old Testament times, skin conditions were diagnosed by observation. The priests not only had a religious function, but they also served as physicians. • **one of his sons:** These priestly functions were to apply to future generations of priests as well.\n\n
13:3	idm14108					 **more than skin-deep:** This indicates that either the infection had eaten away the skin or the infection was visible beneath the skin. The white hair, together with the depression in the skin, indicated a skin disease that could spread (*13:21-23*). This made the person unclean (*13:8*).\n\n
13:4	idm14117					 The purpose of a **quarantine** was primarily diagnostic. It gave the priest an opportunity to examine the patient’s symptoms over a period of time.\n\n
13:8	idm14124					 If **the rash** had** spread,** then the priest declared the person unclean and the isolation became long-term.\n\n
13:10	idm14132					 The presence of an **open sore** was the crucial factor, because it indicated infection.\n\n
13:12	idm14139					 The **completely white** skin might refer simply to a loss of pigment (see also *13:3*), whereas raw flesh (*13:10*, *14*) indicated infection and ceremonial uncleanness.\n\n
13:24	idm14149					 The priest was to inspect the **burned area** to see if the wound had become infected (see *13:9-17*). • **hair . . . turned white:** See *13:18-23*.\n\n
13:30	idm14159					 The **scabby sore** suggested a fungal infection in the scalp or beard, hidden by hair. The symptoms included loss of hair and crusty skin.\n\n
13:38	idm14166					 If a **skin rash** showed pus or inflammation (*13:42*), it was probably an infection. If it only showed as a whitened area, it was probably vitiligo (leucoderma). With this harmless disorder, patches of skin lose their pigmentation.\n\n
13:42	idm14174					 A **reddish white sore** perhaps indicated pus and inflammation.\n\n
13:45	idm14181					 Tearing one’s **clothing,** letting one’s hair go **uncombed,** and covering the **mouth** were common ways of expressing mourning (*10:6*). • The cry of **Unclean! Unclean!** denoted social unacceptability as much as a health threat. It warned others that the individual’s skin disorder could be contagious and that holy things should not touch the unclean person.\n\n
13:46	idm14192					 The Tabernacle containing the Ark was in the center of the camp so that God could be considered as being in the camp (*Deut 23:14*). As long as an individual’s skin disorder persisted, he or she was to stay **in isolation . . . outside the camp.** This ensured that the infection would not spread to others and that the uncleanness would not come in contact with holy things. Even Miriam, sister of Moses and Aaron, had to spend seven days outside the camp (*Num 12:15*). This area was not exclusive to those suffering from skin disorders. The uneaten sin offering was taken there and burned (*Lev 4:21*). Criminals were executed there (*24:14*, *23*), and corpses were carried there to avoid contaminating the area where the people lived (*10:4-5*). Even bodily functions were attended to outside the camp (*Deut 23:12-14*).\n\n
13:47	idm14206					 The rainy season in Israel, when the weather is humid and cool, extends from mid-October through March. Mildew flourishes during this time, and the spores can trigger serious allergic reactions, posing a health problem. The regulations for mildew in clothing were similar to those for infections in people. If the mildew showed signs of spreading, it was serious. If it could be stopped or washed or cut out, a garment could be saved. This process was also similar to the treatment of rot and mold in buildings (*14:33-53*).\n\n
13:47	idm14213					 **mildew:** The word refers here to a variety of molds or mildews that infected cloth or leather.\n\n
14:1	idm14220					 These verses, dealing with the purification of infected individuals, are best understood when read in conjunction with *13:1-46*.\n\n
14:4	idm14227					 The items listed here were part of the cleansing ritual involving the ashes of the red heifer (*Num 19:6*), but their exact significance is unknown. See also *Heb 9:18-22*. **Hyssop** was a small plant used for sprinkling blood (*Exod 12:22*) and in purification rites (*Num 19:18*).\n\n
14:5	idm14238					 Killing the bird and sprinkling its blood (*14:7*) reflects *Exod 24:6-8*, where all of Israel was sprinkled with blood to establish the people as God’s covenant community. Here the individual was cleansed by being sprinkled with blood and allowed to return to community membership. Fresh water was also used in cleansing ceremonies (*Num 8:7*) and in sacrifice preparation (*Lev 1:9*, *13*).\n\n
14:7	idm14249					 Just as the goat released to Azazel symbolized the removal of sin from the community on the Day of Atonement (*16:10*, *20-22*), the **release** of **the live bird** symbolized the removal of the individual’s uncleanness.\n\n
14:12	idm14259					 This **guilt offering** (sometimes called the “penalty offering” or “reparation offering”) was offered because the unclean person living outside the camp could not bring sacrifices, tithes, and offerings during the period of uncleanness (see *5:14-16*).\n\n
14:14	idm14267					 The **lobe, thumb,** and **big toe** represent what the whole person hears and does, and where he or she goes (also *14:17*, *28*; see *study note on 8:23*).\n\n
14:15	idm14278					 In the ancient world, **olive oil** was commonly used to aid healing (see *Isa 1:6*; *Luke 10:34*). Its use here might symbolize the healing and cleansing of the infection, which allowed the person to return to the community. Perhaps it also represented restored union between God, the priest, and the worshiper.\n\n
14:19	idm14287					 This **sin offering** was the offering of purification mentioned in *12:6* (see *4:2-3*). • The **burnt offering** provided atonement for sins committed during the period of uncleanness when the person was unable to bring offerings (see *1:4*).\n\n
14:20	idm14298					 **grain offering:** See *study note on 2:1-16*.\n\n
14:21	idm14306					 The ritual for the **poor** was very similar to the conventional purification offering, but it allowed for the use of less expensive birds in place of a lamb (see *5:7-13*).\n\n
14:33	idm14314					 The contamination of buildings by rot or mildew made them unhealthy or even unsafe. These buildings were considered diseased and therefore not whole or clean (see *study note on 11:1–15:33*). The inspection and treatment process was similar to the one for mildew in clothing (*13:47-59*).\n\n
14:34	idm14322					 **I may contaminate:** In the absolute monotheism of biblical language, God causes or allows everything. For example, *Exod 21:13* describes an accidental death as something that God allowed to happen (see also *Deut 19:4-5*).\n\n
14:36	idm14331					 Having **the house emptied** indicated that it was not actually unclean until the priest pronounced it so. The owner would remove furnishings so that they would not be included in the quarantine.\n\n
14:37	idm14338					 If the mildew extended **deeper than the wall’s surface** it was more serious than if it were just on the surface. The same idea was expressed by “more than skin-deep” in the examination of infected individuals (see *study note on 13:3*).\n\n
14:54	idm14346					 A summary statement about infections of all sorts (cp. *11:46-47*).\n\n
15:1	idm14353					 The principle of normal and abnormal and the created order again aids the interpretation of these regulations (see “*Clean, Unclean, and Holy*” Theme Note). Bodily discharges, such as infections (see *study note on 13:1-46*), were not “normal” because they weakened the vitality of the person, so the person was not seen as whole. Whether male (*15:1-18*) or female (*15:19-33*), such a person became unclean.\n\n
15:2	idm14363					 **bodily discharge** (literally *a flowing from his flesh*): Most scholars interpret the word *flesh* as a euphemism for sexual organs and the symptoms described here as indicating an infection of gonorrhea. Others suggest that it refers to a discharge of semen or even diarrhea. A discharge of semen is unlikely, however, because that is singled out in *15:16-17* and required only washing with water. It is clear that this bodily discharge proceeded from “under the man” (*15:10*) and contaminated anything he sat on or lay upon (*15:4*, *6*, *9*).\n\n
15:13	idm14377					 In contrast to the man with a skin disease (see *13:46*), a man with a bodily discharge was apparently allowed to live at home. He did not have to undergo the more elaborate cleansing ritual described in ch *14*. He simply had to wait seven days after the discharge ceased, wash (*15:13*), and present the least expensive animal sacrifice of two birds—one as a **sin offering** and the other as a whole **burnt offering.**\n\n
15:16	idm14388					 In the case of an **emission of semen***,* the discharge was not a sign of illness (see *study note on 15:1-33*). Still, the same rule applied; the man must wash and be considered unclean until the next evening.\n\n
15:18	idm14397					 If the seminal emission involved **sexual intercourse***,* both the man and the woman became unclean and had to wash and remain unclean until the next evening. Although it involved a bodily emission, sexual intercourse was not an infection or abnormality, and it required no sacrifices.\n\n
15:19	idm14405					 There is nothing wrong or diseased about a woman’s **menstrual period**. However, because it is accompanied by a bloody discharge, the woman was considered ceremonially unclean (see *15:32-33*). The restrictions were similar to the restrictions on the man with the bodily discharge (*15:2-12*): She was allowed to live at home, but whatever she sat on became unclean. Anyone who touched her had to wash, and presumably she also did so at the end of the seven-day quarantine. However, no animal sacrifice was required.\n\n
15:24	idm14414					 **Sexual intercourse** with a woman during her menstrual period will later be forbidden and given a harsh penalty (*18:19*). This verse probably describes a case in which the woman’s menstrual flow went unnoticed when the sexual activity began or in which the woman’s period began during intercourse. The regulations required the man who came into contact with her blood to share the woman’s seven-day quarantine.\n\n
15:25	idm14422					 Normal menstruation required no offering from the woman (*15:19-24*). A discharge of blood that exceeded seven days required a cleansing ceremony similar to that for the man cleansed of a bodily discharge (*15:13-15*; see also *Matt 9:20-22*).\n\n
15:32	idm14431					 A summary of the principles stated in *15:1-31*. Bodily discharges—whether pus, semen, menstrual fluid, or blood—made an individual ceremonially unclean.\n\n
16:1	idm14438					 The Day of Atonement, the tenth day of the seventh month (see *16:29*; *23:27*; *Num 29:7*), was the most solemn day of the year for Israelites. It was the only required fast, and it was a Sabbath of rest for all the people (*Lev 23:32*). Introduced by the Festival of Trumpets (*Num 29:1*, *7-11*), it was the day when the corporate sins of the community were atoned for. Only the high priest (Aaron) could officiate, because only he could represent all the people, including other priests (Aaron’s sons). The Day of Atonement is celebrated today as Yom Kippur.\n\n
16:2	idm14450					 An **inner curtain** separated the Holy Place from the **Most Holy Place**. Conceptually, the sanctuary was God’s palace, the Most Holy Place was his throne room, and the Ark was his throne (see *1:1*). In the ancient Near East, entering the presence of a king without invitation meant risking death (*Esth 4:11*). The Most Holy Place, therefore, was not a place that Aaron could enter casually. It was off-limits even to the high priest, except when his presence was required by God as part of the ritual of the Day of Atonement.\n\n
16:4	idm14460					 For most of the ritual of the Day of Atonement, the high priest wore plain **linen** clothing rather than his normal robes. This seems to symbolize the humility that should characterize all the people on this solemn occasion. When the high priest stood before God on behalf of his people, he had nothing to commend himself or the people. But when he stood before the people on God’s behalf, his official robes reflected the glory and splendor of God (*16:23*).\n\n
16:6	idm14468					 The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews makes a clear analogy between Aaron’s work for Israel and Christ’s work for the believer. Both brought atonement to their people. Before Aaron could offer a sin offering for the people, he had to offer a sacrifice for himself to make certain his own sins were forgiven (*Heb 5:1-3*). However, although Christ was tempted, he did not sin (*Heb 4:15*). Therefore, in his role as high priest for all Christians, he had no need to make a similar sacrifice (*Heb 7:26-28*).\n\n
16:8	idm14477					 The Hebrew term *‘aza’zel* (**Azazel**) is found only in *16:8*, *10*, *26*. This word has generally been interpreted in four different ways: (1) as a word meaning “the goat of going away”; (2) as a demon that lived in the wilderness; (3) as a strengthened form of the Hebrew word for “go, leave,” meaning “utter loss”; and (4) as a rocky cliff over which the goat was pushed. Since this goat represented the removal of the sins of Israel from the camp (*16:22*), the first interpretation is probably the simplest solution.\n\n
16:16	idm14489					 The high priest needed to **purify** the **Most Holy Place** and the rest of the **Tabernacle** because, over the course of the year, the sins the Israelites had committed had brought uncleanness on the whole sanctuary. If the Tabernacle was to remain the place for meeting God in the coming year, it had to be purified. The same applied to the altar (*16:18*).\n\n
16:23	idm14499					 For this ceremony, the high priest had to put on special clothing (*16:4*), which he used for no other purpose. When the ceremony concluded, he was to **leave the garments** in **the Most Holy Place**. Many scholars believe that the bathing and changes of clothing were necessary because handling the sin offering brought defilement.\n\n
16:27	idm14508					 For the Day of Atonement, the high priest took the **blood** of the **sin offerings . . . into the Most Holy Place**. As a result, the offerings were **burned** and not eaten (*4:3-21*).\n\n
16:29	idm14518					 **must deny yourselves:** The Hebrew term (*‘anah**,* “humble, afflict yourselves”) is closely connected with fasting (*Isa 58:3*, *5*). • **foreigners** (Hebrew *ger*): The Hebrew term denotes those who were not Israelites yet lived among the Israelites. Foreigners participated to some extent in Israelite worship (see *Num 9:14*) and represented potential converts. They probably did not own land but were day laborers, share-croppers, or tenant farmers. However, if they lived among the Israelites, they were expected to abide by Israelite law and customs (see, e.g., *Lev 24:16*).\n\n
16:31	idm14533					 The Day of Atonement was regarded as a **Sabbath day.** No one in the camp, Israelite or foreigner, was permitted to work (see *19:30*).\n\n
17:1	idm14541					 This section deals with how the community of Israel was to observe holiness. Holiness does not describe one attribute of God among many. Rather, it is the sum of all attributes of his person, nature, and character (see *study note on Exod 3:5*). His “glory” is the manifestation of his perfect person, nature, and character (see *Lev 9:6*). God’s covenant with Israel meant that the people and the nation participated in God’s holiness. This holiness depended on Israel’s relationship with God. This relationship brought certain ethical and ritual expectations for Israel to uphold.\n\n
17:3	idm14549					 These regulations (see also *Deut 12:15-21*) indicate that unsupervised sacrifice could easily lead to the integration of pagan elements into the true worship of the Lord (*Lev 17:7*). Israel was camped around the Tabernacle (*Num 2:2-34*), so it was not inconvenient to bring an animal to the sanctuary for slaughter. *Deuteronomy 12:20-24* anticipates Israel’s settlement in the land and the hardship imposed by this regulation. It permitted slaughtering and eating meat without bringing it to the sanctuary, as long as the blood was not consumed.\n\n
17:4	idm14559					 **will be as guilty as a murderer:** The person had shed an animal’s blood in an unlawful manner. The life of the animal had been given by God; it had to be returned to him in the blood of the sacrificed animal. • **cut off:** See *study note on 7:20-21*.\n\n
17:7	idm14568					 **be unfaithful** (Hebrew *zanah**,* “commit fornication”): Israel was not to worship any god but the Lord (*Exod 20:3*). Israel’s covenant relationship to the Lord was even compared to a marriage (see *Hos 1:2*), and worshiping other gods could be described as spiritual adultery. In addition, many of the Canaanite religions were fertility cults. This verb reflects the prostitution conducted at Canaanite shrines to induce fertility in the land through rites of magic involving sexual intercourse. • The Hebrew word translated **goat idols** is the plural for a male goat. In the ancient world, the male goat was often a symbol of fertility or of a god of the underworld. During the reign of Jeroboam I, many Levites from the northern kingdom moved south to Jerusalem; they had been appalled by the use of goats and bulls in the northern kingdom’s worship (*2 Chr 11:15-16*).\n\n
17:11	idm14581					 **the life of the body is in its blood:** Israel was forbidden to consume blood (*17:10*) because it was symbolic of the life given by God and was reserved as God’s portion of each animal offering. God had also designated the sacrificial blood as the means of atonement. In other words, God’s grace permitted the life of the animal to be accepted in exchange for the life of the sinner. In the New Testament, the blood of Christ—representing his life freely given—has provided eternal redemption for believers (*Heb 9:12*).\n\n
17:13	idm14590					 **cover it with earth:** This restriction kept the hunter from using an animal’s blood for food. Just like the blood of animals presented in altar offerings, the blood of wild game also represented life. Uncovered blood was also the sign of violent crime; innocent blood defiled the land (*Num 35:33*) and cried out to God for justice (*Gen 4:10*; see *Job 16:18*). Covering the blood of a slain animal gave it a symbolic burial. This demonstrated reverence both for the animal’s life and for God, the life-giver. The burial signified the return of that life to God, just like the disposal of the blood by the priest in the altar offerings.\n\n
17:15	idm14600					 An animal killed by a predator or which died of natural causes still had undrained blood in its tissues. This rendered it ceremonially unclean and a potential source of defilement (*22:8*). Israelites were to throw such an animal to the dogs (*Exod 22:31*) or give or sell it to a non-Israelite (*Deut 14:21*). If an Israelite happened to eat an animal with undrained blood, he or she became ceremonially unclean and had to wash in water. The uncleanness itself was not a sin, but neglect of the unclean state brought punishment.\n\n
18:1	idm14609					 Chapters *18* and *20* primarily discuss sexual matters, warning against engaging in pagan practices both religious and secular. These chapters bracket exhortations to pursue holiness in everyday life (ch *19*).\n\n
18:2	idm14618					 Many Near Eastern treaties began with the name and titles of the ruler who was drawing up the treaty. The phrase **I am the** Lord** your God** gives the name of the Great King, Yahweh (English **the** Lord), followed by his title, **your God** (see also *Exod 20:2*; *Deut 5:6*). These words were an abbreviated way to invoke Israel’s covenant with God and all that it implied. By reminding the people that they were the Lord’s, these words carried an authority that required a response (*Lev 11:44*; *18:4-5*). *Chapter 18* begins and ends (*18:30*) with these words, and they appear frequently throughout chs *19–26*.\n\n
18:4	idm14637					 **regulations . . . decrees:** The Bible anticipated that the courts would need to interpret the laws that God had provided to apply them to different circumstances. Such interpretations became case laws; the body of these court decisions was called *mishpatim* in Hebrew (cp. “decrees” in *10:11*). • Paul alludes to these verses in *Rom 10:5* and *Gal 3:12*, where he contrasts the “way of faith” with the “way of law.”\n\n
18:6	idm14648					 **have sexual relations with:** Literally *to uncover the nakedness* *of.* Similar regulations in ch *20* use the Hebrew word *shakab* (“lie with”), a word frequently used to indicate an improper sexual relationship.\n\n
18:7	idm14659					 **violate your father:** The Hebrew text here equates having sexual relations with your mother or any of your father’s wives with having sexual relations with him (cp. *Gen 35:22*; *49:4*; see also *1 Cor 5:1*). The husband and his wife were “two united into one” (*Gen 2:24*; cp. *Eph 5:29*). Always in the background of these commands are the commands to honor your parents (*Lev 20:9*; *Exod 20:12*) and, by extension, other members of the family (see also *study note on Lev 20:17*).\n\n
18:7	idm14674					 **She is your mother:** Incest was prohibited because of the disruption it created in families, so the commands concerning this sin included close relatives not necessarily related by blood. Incest was a serious crime because it brought competition and chaos into the family structure. It threatened the safety of the home by violating a family’s appropriate intimacy and the sense of belonging shared by its members. • The commands were directly addressed to the male, even though the female could be older (such as one’s mother). The male, especially if he was the head of the household or the firstborn, wielded more power than the female; with this position came the responsibility to use that power lawfully. In addition, the male was more likely to be the sexual aggressor in an illicit sexual union, although this was not always the case (e.g., *Gen 39:6-18*).\n\n
18:9	idm14682					 Sexual relations with a full **sister** dishonored both parents, and relations with a **half sister** dishonored one parent.\n\n
18:12	idm14690					 **your father’s sister . . . mother’s sister:** These actions would dishonor your father or mother.\n\n
18:14	idm14697					 Having sexual relations with **your aunt** would dishonor your uncle. In turn, this would also dishonor your father (see *20:20*).\n\n
18:15	idm14705					 Just as having sexual relations with your father’s wife would dishonor your father, having sexual relations with **your daughter-in-law** would dishonor your son. The law called for daughters-in-law to be treated like natural daughters (*Exod 21:9*; cp. *Gen 38:1-30*).\n\n
18:16	idm14714					 Sexual relations with your sister-in-law would be adulterous and disgrace your brother. The exception was the law of levirate marriage (see *Deut 25:5-10*), which called for a man to marry his brother’s widow in order to produce an heir who was considered the dead brother’s son.\n\n
18:17	idm14721					 As with all examples listed in ch *18*, marrying a **woman** together with **her daughter** or **granddaughter** was prohibited because of the disruption it would cause in the family order. It would violate the intimacy of the family group by forcing a wife to compete for her husband’s affections against a much younger woman. The penalty for this act was death by burning (*20:14*).\n\n
18:18	idm14732					 The word **rivals** (Hebrew *tsarah*) vividly describes the relationship between Leah and Rachel (*Gen 29:16–30:24*) and Hannah and Peninnah (*1 Sam 1:6*); in both cases, the fellow wives were driven to bitter rivalry for their husband’s affections.\n\n
18:20	idm14742					 The Hebrew word translated **defile yourself** could be more literally translated *to become ceremonially unclean.* • Sexual intercourse with a **neighbor’s wife** or any married woman defined adultery in the Old Testament. Breaking this law was punishable by death (*Deut 22:22*). Like incest, adultery threatened the integrity and security of the home and family. In this case, it violated the covenant of marriage and divided the adulterer’s affection between his spouse and his mistress.\n\n
18:21	idm14752					 **Molech** was the national god of the Ammonites (*1 Kgs 11:7*). This god was later worshiped by Israel during times of apostasy (*2 Kgs 23:10*; *Jer 32:35*). Molech probably appears in this list because Molech worship was associated with sexual sins; it seems to have included child sacrifice as well. • To **bring shame on** (literally *blaspheme, profane*) **the name of your God** meant using the name of the Lord as though it were not holy, such as in a false oath (*Lev 19:12*) or in the worship of a false god (*Ezek 20:39*).\n\n
18:22	idm14767					 In *Gen 1:31*, God pronounced all things good. This yielded a theology of the created order where good is defined by what God created and by the way he intended it to function. Part of this “good” was the creation of woman as man’s companion (*Gen 2:22-24*). Marriage forms a microcosm of the human race, which stands as the corporate bearer of God’s image. Sin, introduced by the Fall (*Gen 3*), disrupted the created order. **Homosexuality** is but one example of sinful violation of God’s order; it is tied to the rejection of God by fallen humanity (*Rom 1:25-32*). • The Hebrew word translated **detestable** (*to‘ebah*) indicates strong disapproval and disgust (*Lev 20:13*; see also *18:26-30*).\n\n
18:23	idm14782					 Like homosexuality, bestiality is a violation of the natural order (see *study note on 18:22*). • The phrase **perverse act** referred not only to a violation, but to a confusion of the order God created because it broke down clear boundaries that he had established.\n\n
18:24	idm14790					 **any of these ways:** Pagan worship (*18:21*), homosexuality (*18:22*), and bestiality (*18:23*). • The **land** was so nauseated by Canaanite practices that it would dramatically **vomit them out** (see *18:28*).\n\n
18:28	idm14803					 Just as **the land** would **vomit** out the Canaanites, it would also **vomit out** the Israelites if they acted like the Canaanites (see *study note on 18:24-25*). This came to pass with the destruction and exile of the northern kingdom by the Assyrians in 722 BC (*2 Kgs 17:6*) and when the Babylonians destroyed and exiled Judah in 586 BC (*2 Kgs 25:8-21*).\n\n
19:2	idm14817					 **be holy:** See *study note on 11:44-45*.\n\n
19:3	idm14825					 **I am the** Lord (see *18:2*): These words break ch *19* into terse, staccato sections (*19:3*, *4*, *10*, *12*, *14*, *16*, *18*, *25*, *28*, *30*, *31*, *34*, *36*, *37*). Each use served to remind Israel why they were to obey God’s regulations.\n\n
19:9	idm14849					 **do not harvest. . . . Leave them for the poor:** Israel’s covenant with God included a social structure that created a leveling effect and resisted social divisions. Families were required to provide for family members who faced difficulties. Widows and orphans (*Exod 22:22*), the poor, and foreigners (*Lev 19:10*) were considered members of Israel’s extended family. The poor were not only given special consideration in the offering system (*5:7-13*), but positive steps were taken to make sure they had food to eat.\n\n
19:11	idm14859					 A society that did not respect the property of others would quickly fall apart internally. To **steal** was prohibited (*Exod 20:15*), and those who would **deceive or cheat** were required to present a guilt offering (see *Lev 6:2-7*).\n\n
19:12	idm14869					 To **bring shame on the name** means to blaspheme (see *study note on 18:21*).\n\n
19:13	idm14877					 Day laborers had no land and were a part of Israel’s lowest economic ranks. These **hired workers** depended on landowners for their livelihood. A hired man needed to receive his wages promptly so that he could feed his family (*Deut 24:15*); to withhold the wages of such a worker was to cheat him.\n\n
19:14	idm14885					 The **deaf** and **blind** were helpless people, easy to belittle and exploit. The Israelites were not to take advantage of them.\n\n
19:15	idm14893					 Neither the **poor** nor the **rich** were to be favored in a legal case. Justice was the priority at all times (see *Exod 23:3*, *6*).\n\n
19:16	idm14903					 **Do not spread slanderous gossip:** The image here is of a merchant who trades and sells harmful rumors and accusations. This practice would quickly erode and undermine the sense of community so valued in Israel (cp. *Prov 11:13*; *16:28*; *20:19*; *26:20*; *2 Cor 12:20*).\n\n
19:17	idm14915					 **for any of your relatives:** The Hebrew term can refer to any fellow Israelite; all Israel was considered one family (cp. *1 Jn 3:15*). • **Confront people directly:** Love does not mean closing one’s eyes to wrong; reproof can help a person change.\n\n
19:18	idm14924					 **love your neighbor as yourself:** This is the cornerstone for biblical ethics in both the Old Testament and the New Testament (see *Matt 22:39*; *Mark 12:31*; *Luke 10:27*; *Rom 13:8-9*; *Gal 5:14*; *Jas 2:8*). It includes foreigners (*Lev 19:34*; cp. *Luke 10:30-37*). Conversely, hate leads to a **grudge** that can bear violent fruit (see *1 Jn 2:10-11*; *4:20*).\n\n
19:19	idm14942					 **two different kinds:** God created a natural order (*Gen 1:31*; see *Lev 18:22*), and it is violated when God’s boundaries are crossed. The prohibitions against intermixing were also object lessons for the Israelites, who were not to intermarry with the Canaanites.\n\n
19:20	idm14951					 Betrothal in the biblical world was considered equivalent to marriage. Sexual relations with a betrothed or engaged woman who was not a slave merited death, the same punishment as for adultery (*Deut 22:22*; see *Lev 18:20*). However, the situation was less clear when the woman was a slave who might be unable to refuse. While slaves in Israel had considerably more rights than those in Mesopotamia or Egypt, they were still not free. Because a **slave girl** could not be punished, **the man** was also left unpunished. Still, he was guilty in God’s sight and had to sacrifice a ram for his sin.\n\n
19:23	idm14961					 For the **first three years,** a newly planted fruit tree was only to be pruned and cultivated. This allowed all the strength to go back into the tree. In the **fourth year,** all of the fruit was considered the “first crop” and was given to God (see *Exod 23:16*). Only in the **fifth year** could the fruit be eaten.\n\n
19:26	idm14971					 **blood:** See *study note on 7:22-27*. • Priests were permitted to consult the Urim and Thummim (*Exod 28:30*) or to cast lots (*Lev 16:8*) to help decide cases not covered by Mosaic regulations. However, those who practiced **fortune-telling or witchcraft** were actually consulting a power apart from the Lord, which was forbidden under the first commandment (*Exod 20:3*).\n\n
19:27	idm14983					 **Do not trim:** As discovered in Egyptian wall paintings, Canaanites carefully trimmed their hair and beards. The Israelites were not to imitate this practice so that they would not be influenced by Canaanite religion and ethics.\n\n
19:28	idm14990					 **cut your bodies:** Cutting oneself was associated with Canaanite mourning practices (*21:5*; *Deut 14:1*). The word translated **tattoo** might refer to painting the body, a practice also associated with paganism.\n\n
19:29	idm15000					 Cp. *21:9*; *Deut 23:17*.\n\n
19:30	idm15008					 **Sabbath days:** The Hebrew word translated “Sabbath” (*shabbath*) is related to a verb which means simply “to cease,” implying rest from one’s labor. The Sabbath commemorated God’s resting on the seventh day after he had completed his work of creation (*Gen 1:31*; *2:1-3*). It began at sundown on the sixth day. With the exodus from Egypt, the Sabbath gained covenantal significance (*Exod 16:23-25*; *31:13*). Because only free people, not slaves, had a regular day of rest, the Sabbath became symbolic of Israel’s liberation from bondage in Egypt (see *Deut 5:13-15*). • The people were to **show reverence** (literally *fear*) because the **sanctuary***,* like the Sabbath, was holy. They were not to enter it when they were unclean or bring anything unclean into it.\n\n
19:31	idm15025					 **mediums:** Cp. *1 Sam 28:7-25*. • The Hebrew term for **consult the spirits** (*yidde‘oni*) is derived from a root meaning “to know.” It describes those who claim to have special occult knowledge and use it to communicate with the dead.\n\n
19:32	idm15035					 In the ancient world, **the elderly** and **the aged** were respected for their wisdom (*Job 32:7*). Honoring the elderly also honors God.\n\n
19:33	idm15044					 The Israelites, **once foreigners living in . . . Egypt,** were to remember their own mistreatment and avoid inflicting similar abuse on others (see *Deut 10:19*).\n\n
19:35	idm15052					 **dishonest standards:** Merchants would sometimes use two different sets of weights, one heavy and one light (*Deut 25:13-15*), in order to cheat customers. The Bible makes it clear that this practice was abhorrent to God (*Prov 11:1*; *16:11*; *20:10*, *23*; *Mic 6:11*).\n\n
20:2	idm15065					 Stoning was the conventional means of enforcing capital punishment (see also *20:27*; *24:14*, *16*, *23*; *Exod 19:13*; *Num 15:35-36*; *Deut 17:2-7*; *Josh 7:25-26*; *John 8:1-11*).\n\n
20:9	idm15080					 Because pagan worship affected ethics, the regulations for families follow immediately after those dealing with pagan religious practices. To some extent, the laws of this section replicate those of *18:6-30*, which precede the section dealing with proper expressions of holiness (*19:1-37*). These were all related issues, as the proper worship of God led to proper conduct toward other people, while improper worship of God led to moral violations.\n\n
20:9	idm15088					 The Hebrew word for **dishonors** means “to make light of, treat with contempt,” and is traditionally translated “curse,” in the sense of calling someone a vulgar or profane name. Parental authority was given by God, not chosen by the child (see *Exod 20:12*; *Deut 21:18-21*).\n\n
20:10	idm15097					 See *study note on 18:20*; see also *Exod 20:14*.\n\n
20:11	idm15105					 See *study note on 18:7-8*. This injunction made it clear that the crime was seen as both incest and adultery.\n\n
20:17	idm15112					 **a shameful disgrace:** Proper conduct brings honor both to individuals and to their households; improper conduct brings shame. • Both parties are **cut off** (see *7:20-21*), but the man **will be punished** (see *5:1*; *18:6*).\n\n
20:20	idm15124					 Being left **childless** carried a social stigma and was considered a judgment from God (see *Gen 30:1-2*; *Deut 7:14*). What situation is envisioned in these verses? Sexual relations with a sister-in-law (*Lev 18:16*) or an **uncle’s wife** (*18:14*) have already been discussed. Adultery is dealt with elsewhere and would bring death to both parties (*Deut 22:22*). If the woman involved was a widow without a male heir, the law of levirate marriage could be invoked (*Deut 25:5-6*; see *study note on Lev 18:16*). Since those situations don’t seem to apply, it would appear that this law refers to marrying an aunt or a sister-in-law after she has been divorced from her husband. John the Baptist apparently applied this law to condemn Herod Antipas’s marriage to Herodias (see *Mark 6:17-29*).\n\n
20:24	idm15140					 The expression **flowing with milk and honey** is common in Exodus—Deuteronomy. It conveys the idea of food being abundant and easy to get. This contrasts with Egypt, where everything depended on the flooding of the Nile and irrigation (*Deut 11:9-12*).\n\n
21:1	idm15148					 This section, which covers priestly regulations, is punctuated six times with the phrase **I am the** Lord** who makes . . . holy** (*21:15*, *23*; *22:9*, *16*, *32*; cp. *21:8*). The words reaffirm the necessary connection between the holiness of God and the holiness expected of the priesthood, and by extension, of all Israel (see *8:10*; *11:44-45*; *19:2*). Priests are specifically addressed in *21:1–22:16*, while both clergy and laity are included in *22:17-33*.\n\n
21:1	idm15168					 Touching a **dead body** rendered a person unclean for seven days. Because a priest had to be prepared to deal with holy things at all times, he was not allowed to handle a dead body, even of a relative, or else he could be unfit to minister when needed. The only exceptions were his **closest relatives** because there might not be anyone else who could bury the bodies.\n\n
21:5	idm15176					 **shave . . . trim:** See study notes on *10:6*; *19:27*. • **cut their bodies:** See *study note on 19:28*. Self-mutilation was a pagan custom. Just as defects of any kind precluded most animals as offerings (*22:19-25*), a defect similarly precluded a priest from officiating (see *21:17-23*). For example, a eunuch could not serve as a priest (*Deut 23:1*) because he was not an adequate representative of the people. However, his priestly lineage was recognized as qualifying him to eat his priestly share (see *Lev 21:22*). On the other hand, uncleanness disqualified any priest from ministry and from eating the priest’s share as long as the condition persisted (*22:2-8*).\n\n
21:6	idm15192					 A priest should **never bring shame** by profaning God’s name.\n\n
21:7	idm15199					 The priest, to lead Israel in worship, had to model the highest standard of conduct for the people both in his personal life and in leadership of his family. He could have no ties to pagan culture (prostitution, *21:9*), nor could the legitimacy of his family be questioned (divorce). Similar standards applied to leaders of the early church (*1 Tim 3:1-13*).\n\n
21:10	idm15207					 The restrictions made on the common priests (*21:1-4*) applied even more stringently to the **high priest** because he had to represent all Israel, including the other priests. • The priest must **never leave his hair uncombed** or **tear his clothing** in mourning, so that he would always be fit to minister. Although the common priest was permitted to marry a widow, the high priest was allowed to marry only a virgin. This made certain that the future high priest and the common priests descended from that union would have an unquestioned lineage (*21:15*).\n\n
21:22	idm15218					 **he may eat:** Although a mutilation or defect (see *21:18-20*) disqualified a descendant of Aaron from representing the people, it did not compromise his priestly lineage. He was eligible to eat the priest’s share of the offerings (see *2:3*, *10*; *6:17-18*).\n\n
22:2	idm15229					 The priest’s portions of **the sacred offerings** were regarded as “most holy” (see *2:3*) and were not to come into contact with anything unclean (*11:1–15:33*). Accordingly, any descendant of Aaron who was unclean was forbidden to eat this food.\n\n
22:5	idm15238					 In Leviticus, the Hebrew word *sherets* always denotes an unclean **small animal** that swarms on land or in water (*5:2*; *11:10*, *20-21*, *23*, *29*, *31*, *41-44*).\n\n
22:9	idm15253					 **will die for violating my instructions:** As in *10:1-3*. The temptation to offer improper offerings persisted throughout Israel’s history until after the Exile (*Mal 1:6-9*).\n\n
22:11	idm15262					 The only male outside the priest’s family who could eat the priest’s share was the priest’s **slave**. He would have no other food if this provision were denied him.\n\n
22:14	idm15269					 Similar to provisions for the guilt offering, a common person who accidentally ate the priestly portion had to repay 120 percent (see *5:14-16*). However, the offering of a ram was not required in this case.\n\n
22:15	idm15276					 An Israelite who ate the “most holy” priestly portion as if it were common food would **defile** it.\n\n
22:18	idm15283					 Apparently individuals could present a whole **burnt offering** instead of a peace offering if they desired (see *1:3*).\n\n
22:21	idm15291					 A **peace offering** could function in several ways: as a thanksgiving offering, an offering to fulfill a vow, or a voluntary offering (see *3:1-17*).\n\n
22:23	idm15299					 The requirements for the **voluntary offering** were more lenient, allowing the use of a deformed animal. Fulfilling a **vow***,* however, still required an animal that was not maimed or diseased. In no case would God accept a sacrifice that could not be eaten by a person or that was not a whole animal.\n\n
22:27	idm15308					 Leaving a newborn animal **with its mother for seven days** allowed time to determine the animal’s health (see *Exod 22:30*).\n\n
22:28	idm15316					 **on the same day:** There are several possible explanations for this command, although none is certain: (1) Senseless slaughtering would leave nothing of the herd; (2) it would be inhumane to slaughter the young and the mother at the same time; or (3) it would be too similar to pagan worship rites, where the newborn animal was cooked in the milk of its slain mother (see *Exod 23:19*).\n\n
23:2	idm15324					 These **appointed festivals** included occasions for eating, resting, and even fasting. For additional details, see *Num 28–29*.\n\n
23:5	idm15332					 **Passover . . . Unleavened Bread:** These feasts were instituted on the eve of the exodus from Egypt (see *Exod 12:1-28*). Passover was the first of three great festivals (*Deut 16:16*), followed by the Festival of Harvest (*Lev 23:15-21*) and the Festival of Shelters (*23:34-43*).\n\n
23:5	idm15343					 **Passover** began **at sundown on the fourteenth day of the first month,** as the new day was beginning (see *study note on 11:24-25*). The Passover feast included a roast lamb, bitter salad greens, and bread made without yeast (*Exod 12:8*), all representing Israel’s liberation from Egyptian bondage. • The **first month** marked the beginning of the Jewish calendar as late as *Ezra 6:19*. The month’s earliest name, Abib (“spring, fresh grain”; *Exod 13:4*; *23:15*; *34:18*; *Deut 16:1*), was partially replaced by the name Nisan after the Babylonian exile (*Neh 2:1*; *Esth 3:7*).\n\n
23:6	idm15361					 Following Passover was the **Festival of Unleavened Bread,** during which Israel ate bread made without yeast (see *study note on 2:11*) to remember the Egyptian slavery that it represented and the haste with which they departed Egypt (*Deut 16:3*).\n\n
23:10	idm15370					 Just as the burned portion of each sacrifice represented the whole offering and the tithe symbolized that all of a person’s money belonged to God, so also the first portions of each harvest, or **first crops***,* symbolized the entire harvest, and even the land itself (*25:23*), as belonging to the Lord. In the barley harvest, the first portions were offered as part of the Festival of Unleavened Bread (*23:6*, *10-12*). The first portions of the wheat harvest were offered during the Festival of Harvest (*23:15-21*; *Exod 34:22*). These gifts to God recognized God’s prior gifts to Israel (see *Lev 2:1*). The entire offering of first crops became the property and food of God’s representatives, the priests (see *2:14-16*).\n\n
23:11	idm15385					 The phrase **lift it up** symbolizes presenting the grain to the Lord (see *study note on 7:34*).\n\n
23:14	idm15393					 Israelites could not eat food from the harvest **on that day** until they acknowledged God’s provision by presenting him with the appropriate offering.\n\n
23:15	idm15400					 Israel was to start the count of **seven full weeks** on the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The fiftieth day marked the beginning of the Festival of Harvest (the New Testament name of “Pentecost” is derived from the Greek word for “fifty”). For this festival the people were to offer the first portions of the wheat harvest. Each person was also required to take three quarts of fine flour and bake two loaves of yeast bread. These offerings were then presented to the priest officiating at the sanctuary. See also *study note on Exod 23:16*.\n\n
23:18	idm15408					 The **liquid offerings** probably consisted of two quarts of wine (see *Exod 29:40*; *Num 15:5*, *10*).\n\n
23:24	idm15418					 **On the first day of the appointed month in early autumn:** The Israelite calendar was divided into two half-years. The first half-year began with the first month, Nisan (Babylonian name) or Abib (the more ancient agricultural name). The second half-year began with the seventh month (Tishri in the modern Jewish calendar). The celebration of this holiday marked the beginning of the second half-year.\n\n
23:27	idm15425					 The **Day of Atonement** was the most solemn day in the Israelite calendar and the only day of fasting (ch *16*). The high priest made atonement for the corporate sin of the people, laying the theological foundation for the atonement made by Jesus Christ (*Heb 9:11-12*).\n\n
23:29	idm15434					 **cut off . . . destroy:** See *study note on 7:20-21*; cp. *Exod 31:14*, *15*; *35:2*.\n\n
23:34	idm15445					 During the Festival of Shelters, the Israelites lived in temporary shelters for seven days. This commemorated the time they had spent in tents and other temporary shelters during the wilderness wanderings and also recalled God’s faithfulness to them during those times. For a list of sacrifices to be offered each day, see *Num 29:12-34*.\n\n
23:39	idm15452					 **after you have harvested all the produce:** The **Festival of Shelters** was also called the Festival of Final Harvest (*Exod 34:22*) because all of the unharvested fruit and vegetables were gathered.\n\n
23:43	idm15461					 The Israelites were never to forget God’s great acts of redemption on their behalf, but were to **remind each new generation** of what God had done (*Deut 4:9*; *11:19*). Their understanding of who they were and of who God was revolved around their knowledge of those things. See *Deut 6:20-24*; *26:5-9*; *Josh 24:2-13*; *Ps 136*.\n\n
24:5	idm15474					 Traditionally called the “shewbread” (kjv), **twelve flat loaves** (see *Exod 25:30*) of this bread, the “Bread of the Presence,” were to be placed on the table in the Holy Place each Sabbath (*Exod 25:23-30*). This bread was considered part of the priest’s portion of the offerings. David and his men ate this bread while fleeing from Saul (*1 Sam 21:1-6*; see *Matt 12:1-8*).\n\n
24:7	idm15486					 Since a portion of this bread was to be burned as **a representative offering** (see *2:2*), it would have been made without yeast (that is, unleavened; see *2:11*).\n\n
24:10	idm15495					 A large body of non-Israelites, including other Semitic people as well as Egyptians, came out of Egypt with Israel (*Exod 12:38*). Among them was a man of mixed parentage, whose mother was an Israelite and whose father was an Egyptian. A quarrel broke out between the man and a full-blooded Israelite. In the altercation, the man who was half-Egyptian verbally cursed the Israelite, using the name of God in an irreverent manner.\n\n
24:11	idm15502					 **blasphemed . . . with a curse** In biblical times, a name was more than a means of identification; it represented a person’s character, reputation, and origin. God is holy, and he was to be regarded as holy in all of Israel’s life (see *10:3*). The Israelites had been instructed to treat God’s name with reverence (*Exod 20:7*). Using his name in a curse reflected a sinful attitude toward God himself (*Lev 24:15*), and it deserved death (*24:13-16*). The wording in the Hebrew text is very strong: Two verbs meaning “curse” are used, one that indicated a more formal type of curse, the other a blasphemous or irreverent expression. The two terms are synonymous in *24:15-16*. • **the Name of the** Lord: The Hebrew text refers simply to “the Name” to reflect care and reverence for God’s name.\n\n
24:14	idm15516					 Those who heard a **blasphemer** curse were to **lay their hands on his head**. This indicated their own innocence by symbolically transferring the guilt (see *16:21*), as well as their willingness to accept responsibility for the blasphemer’s death. A single witness was not enough to cause a man to die (see *Num 35:30*; *Deut 17:2-7*; *Matt 18:16*; *2 Cor 13:1*; *1 Tim 5:19*; *Heb 10:28*).\n\n
24:17	idm15531					 Because human life was patterned after the life of God himself (*Gen 1:26*, *27*), murder was a blasphemous act. It required the same penalty as oral blasphemy (*Gen 9:6*). For a similar law and its qualifiers, see *Exod 21:12-14*.\n\n
24:20	idm15541					 **eye for an eye:** The legal principle involved is often called *lex talionis* (“law of retaliation”), which is that the penalty must fit the crime. When an injured party sought revenge on behalf of their kinsman (see *Num 35:19-21*), excessive revenge naturally ensued instead of appropriate justice. This provoked even greater retaliation, resulting in a cycle of increasing violence. *Lex talionis* served to regulate the prosecution of crimes (see also *Lev 6:2-7*; cp. *Exod 21:24*; *Lev 24:20*; *Deut 19:21*; *Matt 5:28-39*).\n\n
24:22	idm15556					 Although **foreigners** were not citizens, they were human beings entitled to equal justice under the law (see *16:29*, *31*).\n\n
25:1	idm15565					 Just as seven days equaled a week ending in a Sabbath day, each seven years ended with **a Sabbath year**. Likewise, after **seven Sabbath years** (i.e., 49 years total) came a special year, the **Year of Jubilee**. Like so many holidays, these occasions were times of reflection on Israel’s corporate identity and how they were shaped by their relationship with God. Because every Israelite, bond or free, had a part in God’s kingdom, those bound in servitude were freed in the Year of Jubilee (*25:39-43*). In order to curb economic hardship and foster well-being, land sales were limited to a maximum term of fifty years. The land was then to be returned to the original owner’s family or clan. The land belonged to the Lord; the Israelites were merely tenants (*25:23*). It is unlikely, however, that these laws saw much use; the best land fell into the hands of rich landowners (*Isa 5:8-10*; cp. *Amos 5:11*).\n\n
25:2	idm15578					 During the **year** of **Sabbath rest,** there was to be no formal cultivation or harvesting of the land; from what grew on its own the landowner could gather what he needed for his household day by day. Whatever remained uneaten was left for the poor and for foreigners (*Exod 23:10-11*), and what they left provided food for both wild and domestic animals. See also *Exod 21:2*; *Deut 15:1-11*.\n\n
25:4	idm15589					 **land must have a Sabbath year:** The principle behind the Sabbath (see *study note on 19:30*) was that God rested and therefore man rests. Here the principle was extended to the land.\n\n
25:8	idm15597					 The **Year of Jubilee** took place every **fiftieth year** as a release from obligations and servitude. The same year was also treated as a Sabbath year with no farming. Some scholars argue that the forty-ninth year served as both Sabbath (seventh) and jubilee (fiftieth) years. A simple count of fifty years would place the Year of Jubilee immediately after the seventh Sabbath year, which would mean two consecutive years without harvests. • Each Year of Jubilee the land was to revert to the clan or tribe that had originally received it under Joshua (*Josh 13–21*). Land had two functions: (1) It provided an economic basis for existence; and (2) it tied the landowner to his ancestors and, through them, to the land allocation under Joshua and even to the covenant with Moses. The return of the land was to prevent powerful land monopolies that would close out the poor.\n\n
25:10	idm15606					 **proclaim freedom throughout the land for all who live there:** See *25:39-43*, *47-55*. • **return to the land that belonged to your ancestors:** If the individual who originally owned the land had died, the land was returned to his heirs.\n\n
25:11	idm15616					 All the regulations of the Sabbath year also applied to the Year of Jubilee.\n\n
25:15	idm15622					 **the number of years:** The law did not allow the land to be sold in perpetuity. It was God’s, and Israel was simply permitted to use it (*25:23*). However, if the owner was forced to give it up due to financial distress, it could be leased for up to forty-nine years (until the next jubilee). The price was adjusted according to the length of the lease. At the end of that time, the land was to revert to the family of the original owner.\n\n
25:23	idm15630					 **the land belongs to me:** Israel’s ownership of the land was derivative, not absolute—ownership depended on the covenant, in which God himself allotted them the land (*Deut 1:8*, *39*). The ideas of land stewardship and of sharing material resources stem naturally from this concept of God’s ownership.\n\n
25:25	idm15639					 The Hebrew word translated **buy it back** (*ga’al*) is often translated “redeem.” It means “to restore something to its original or proper state of existence.” The noun derived from this root (*go’el*) indicates the **close relative** who will restore what is out of order. The relative’s duties were to redeem the property of his kinsman and keep it in the family (see *Ruth 4:1-4*; *Jer 32:6-15*); to seek out the murderer of his kinsman and bring him to justice (*Num 35:19*); and to marry his brother’s widow and father a male heir to inherit the estate of his dead kinsman (*Deut 25:5-10*; see *Gen 38:6-30*; *Ruth 4:9-10*).\n\n
25:29	idm15655					 A house in an unwalled **village** was apparently considered the same as land. It could be bought back, and if not, ownership reverted in the Year of Jubilee to the family of the individual who sold it. No farm or grazing acreage was involved in the sale of a **house inside a walled town.** Because such a house could be built on the town wall without having to rest on the earth (*Josh 2:15*), there was no land to redeem. Therefore, it could not be bought back unless the new owner desired to sell it, nor did it revert **to the original owner in the Year of Jubilee**.\n\n
25:32	idm15665					 The tribe of Levi could not inherit tribal territory because, as the priestly tribe, they were scattered throughout the land (*Deut 18:1*; see *Gen 49:5-7*; *Num 35:1-8*; *Josh 21:1-42*). The Levites could inherit only certain cities and the pasturelands surrounding them (*Num 35:2*). Therefore, they were an exception to the rules regarding land ownership, and their meager holdings were carefully protected. Their houses could be redeemed even in walled cities, and the pasturelands outside their towns could not be sold.\n\n
25:35	idm15676					 Impoverished Israelites first looked to family for help (see *study note on 25:25*). Second, they relied on the community, which was commanded to help them rather than exploit their vulnerability.\n\n
25:36	idm15683					 The purpose of a loan was to help a poor person get back on their feet, not to make money from their vulnerability. **Interest** was forbidden on loans to Israelites but permitted on loans to foreigners (*Deut 23:19-20*).\n\n
25:38	idm15691					 The mention of **the land of Egypt** reminded the Israelites that they had been slaves at one time. They were to help the poor among them because of God’s covenant relationship with them (cp. *Exod 20:2* and *Deut 5:6*, where God’s covenant with them is initiated).\n\n
25:40	idm15700					 The terms **hired worker . . . temporary resident** appear in parallel, suggesting they were similar in Israel’s socioeconomic system. Both terms describe day laborers who had no land and depended on landowners to hire them (see *Matt 20:1-16*; also see *study note on Lev 19:13*). • **Jubilee:** See *study note on 25:8-17*.\n\n
25:42	idm15711					 The same Hebrew word is translated as both **servants** and** slaves.** Because the Israelites were God’s slaves/servants, they could not be slaves/servants to other human beings, except temporarily to work off a debt.\n\n
25:43	idm15719					 As human beings created in God’s image (*Gen 1:26*, *27*; *Prov 14:31*; *17:5*) and as fellow Israelites in covenant with God, even bondservants were to be treated with respect. God’s law includes numerous provisions for their protection (see *Exod 21:20*, *26-27*). All human beings must be treated in a way that reflects reverence for God (see *Prov 14:31*; *17:5*; *Jas 2:14-16*; *3:9-10*).\n\n
25:44	idm15735					 **Slaves** in Mesopotamia and Egypt were little more than chattel, with no protection or rights. Israelites were allowed to purchase non-Israelites as slaves, but they were to be treated well and not abused. Occasionally some slaves were even adopted into childless families (*Gen 15:2-4*). Slavery continued into New Testament times, but the foundations had been laid for its dissolution in the Old Testament doctrine of the common origins of all humankind through God. Slavery stemmed from the Fall, when relationships based on power replaced those of fellowship and communication (see *Gen 3:16*). In the New Testament, believers uphold the ideas of fellowship and communication by accepting the title “Christ’s slave” or “servant” (*Rom 1:1*; *Col 4:12*; *2 Pet 1:1*). In Paul’s doctrine of the body of Christ (*1 Cor 12:27*; *Eph 4:12*), all believers acquired a common identity (*Gal 3:28*; *Col 3:11*; *Phlm 1:16*).\n\n
25:47	idm15752					 An Israelite who sold himself or a family member to a foreigner in Israel retained the right to buy himself or the family member back. If he could not find the resources to do that, he was not released during the seventh year (cp. *Exod 21:2*) but had to await the Year of Jubilee. During his service to the foreigner, the Israelite slave was to enjoy the status of a hired servant and not be treated like a slave (*Lev 25:53*). The people of Israel belonged to God; they were not to be sold as permanent slaves to anyone else.\n\n
26:1	idm15760					 Israel was to make no **idols** or **carved images** to worship (see *Exod 20:4-6*). Creating an image to worship would blaspheme God by confining him to time and space and by manufacturing a lifeless image to take the place of the living God. • Early in Israel’s history, stones were set on end as memorials to various events (*Gen 28:18*; *Exod 24:4*). However, **pillars** and **sculptured stones** were associated with pagan worship (*2 Kgs 3:2*; *10:26*, *27*), especially when the carved image of a god rested on them. Some sculpture was clearly allowed (e.g., *1 Kgs 7:25*); the focus here is on objects that might be worshiped and thereby become idolatrous.\n\n
26:3	idm15777					 These blessings and curses resemble a key element of ancient Near Eastern suzerain-vassal treaties. In such treaties, the suzerain king promised to defend the vassal king and his state, while the vassal took an oath of loyalty to his lord. Blessings and curses followed, with the curses generally being more lengthy (contrast *26:3-13* with *26:14-39*; cp. *Deut 27:15–28:68*). Such treaties would call upon the gods as witnesses and enforcers. In God’s covenant with Israel, however, the Lord was one of the parties to the treaty (Israel being the other); since the Lord could swear by no one greater, he swore by himself (see *Gen 22:16*; *Heb 6:13*).\n\n
26:3	idm15788					 Treaties and covenants had conditions attached to them. Israel’s blessings were conditioned on the people’s obedience to the terms revealed by God, to whom they had sworn obedience (*Exod 24:7*; *Josh 24:21-22*). The covenant itself, however, was irrevocable (*Lev 26:44-45*; see *Rom 11:29*); Israel could not cancel it. The people had only two choices: obedience, which brought blessing, or rebellion, which brought curse.\n\n
26:5	idm15798					 Israel’s restoration following captivity also promised a harvest so plentiful that it would run over into the time of planting (see *Amos 9:13*; *Joel 3:18*).\n\n
26:7	idm15806					 Success in warfare would result from obedience to God (cp. *26:17*, *36-37*; *Deut 28:6*, *19*).\n\n
26:9	idm15816					 **fulfill my covenant:** The fulfillment is seen in the “rest” spoken of in Hebrews (*Heb 3:11–4:11*). The Promised Land should have brought a state of security and prosperity, a state of “rest” to the Israelites (*Exod 33:14*; *Deut 12:10*; *25:19*; *Josh 1:13*, *15*). Israel succeeded in entering the Promised Land, but their rebellion kept them from seeing the covenant fulfilled.\n\n
26:12	idm15829					 **your God . . . my people:** The covenant bound the parties to one another, making each belong to the other.\n\n
26:13	idm15836					 **yoke of slavery:** A yoke would fit over a slave’s shoulders and behind the base of the neck for carrying pairs of heavy items, such as pails of water. Cp. *Rom 6:16-22*.\n\n
26:14	idm15844					 The objective of God’s punishment of his people is to change behavior and restore relationship. God responds to his disobedient people as a perfectly righteous and loving parent would to a child. The punishments designed to curb rebellious behavior gradually increase, giving Israel the opportunity to repent at any time (*26:18-28*). Even when Israel was punished with exile from the land in 722 and 586 BC, God was working to restore his people (see, e.g., *Isa 40–66*; *Jer 29:10*; *Amos 9:11-15*).\n\n
26:18	idm15855					 **seven times over:** I.e., many times (see also *26:21*, *24*, *28*; *Gen 4:15*).\n\n
26:19	idm15866					 If God withholds rain, the ground will be hard and unproductive.\n\n
26:29	idm15872					 Starvation would so pervade the land that when a child died of hunger, he or she would be eaten, in pagan fashion, by the others in the family (*Deut 28:53-57*; see *2 Kgs 6:24-31*; *Lam 2:20*; cp. *2 Kgs 3:27*).\n\n
26:30	idm15882					 The **pagan shrines** mentioned here were the infamous “high places” built on hilltops (see *2 Kgs 18:4*). These shrines incorporated elements from pre-Israelite religions into Israel’s worship and challenged the Temple for religious authority. • **places of worship** (Hebrew *khamman*): Perhaps “incense altars.” Some of these altars were used in Baal worship (*2 Chr 34:4*).\n\n
26:34	idm15893					 With the people gone into captivity in a foreign land, there would be no one to work **the land.** It would **at last** have the “rest” of lying fallow that the people had denied it (see *25:1-7*).\n\n
26:36	idm15902					 Disastrous defeat and captivity would later be the fate of both Israel and Judah (see study notes on *18:28*; *26:14-39*).\n\n
26:40	idm15910					 The chapter ends with a message of hope: Even after Israel violated the covenant and experienced judgment, reconciliation and restoration remained possible if the people confessed and repented (see *study note on 4:20*). God’s grace had not been taken away. God did not want to destroy his people; he would restore them if they would only humble themselves and repent (see also *2 Chr 7:14*).\n\n
26:41	idm15918					 Physical circumcision of males was the mark of God’s covenant with Israel (*Gen 17:9-14*; *Exod 4:25-26*). **Stubborn hearts** (literally *uncircumcised hearts*) do not love God and demonstrate it by persistent disobedience. God promised to “circumcise” Israel’s uncircumcised hearts so that the people could love him (see also *Deut 10:16*; *30:6*; *Jer 4:4*; *Ezek 36:25-27*).\n\n
26:42	idm15932					 God had begun his **covenant with Abraham** (then called Abram, *Gen 15:18*) and continued it with **Isaac** (*Gen 17:19*) and **Jacob** (*Exod 2:24*). Jacob’s twelve sons were the ancestors of Israel’s twelve tribes. Israel’s liberation from Egypt and settlement in Canaan were based on God’s promises to their ancestors, not on the Israelites’ own virtues (*Deut 9:4-5*).\n\n
27:1	idm15945					 As a conclusion to the book, this chapter discusses various types of vows and ends with a provision for redeeming one’s tithes (see also ch *25*). Under certain circumstances, such as an emergency, an individual might make a vow promising something to God, usually in exchange for God’s answering his or her prayer (see *Jon 2:9*). Once the prayer is answered, the individual might be tempted to discount the vow. Scripture requires that vows be made carefully (see *Lev 5:4*; *Eccl 5:4-6*) and then carried out. Jesus taught that oaths should not be commonly or carelessly made (*Matt 5:33-37*; *23:16-22*).\n\n
27:2	idm15957					 The vow taken to become a Nazirite is also called a **special vow** (*Num 6:2*), but the vow mentioned here was probably a promise made to God when seeking a desired answer to prayer (see *Gen 28:20-22*). Pagan religions of the time sacrificed infants to their gods, but God outlawed such a practice (*Lev 18:21*; *20:2-5*; cp. *Gen 22:12-13*). Consequently, the concept of being vowed to the Lord was measured in terms of service given, not in the sacrifice of a life. Whether the vow was made by the person or by another acting for him or her, payment was to be made to the sanctuary, apparently for the person’s expenses during the term of service. See also *Num 6:1-21*; *Judg 13:5*, *7*; *1 Sam 1:11*; *Amos 2:11-12*; *Acts 18:18*.\n\n
27:3	idm15975					 This section reflects social rank in ancient Near Eastern cultures. An adult **man** of working age had the highest rank, followed by an adult **woman** of working age. A **boy** ranked higher than a **girl,** and both ranked higher than toddlers. Senior citizens, who were past prime working age, ranked comparably to boys and girls. • The amount of **fifty shekels** (see *study note on 5:15*) would have represented about 20 ounces (570 grams) of silver, a significant amount. Comparisons with other literature of the time indicates that the biblical valuation is quite high and would have been out of reach for most people.\n\n
27:8	idm15987					 As in the offering system (see *5:7-13*), special consideration was given to the poor person who wanted to contribute to the sanctuary. In such cases, the amount of silver to accompany the pledge was left to the priest’s discretion.\n\n
27:9	idm15994					 Once an acceptable **animal** had been vowed and the priest at the sanctuary had accepted it on God’s behalf, the animal became **holy** and belonged to God.\n\n
27:11	idm16002					 An **unclean animal***,* one unfit either for food or sacrifice, could be bought back by the worshiper for its assessed value **plus 20 percent**. No doubt the reasoning behind this rule was to preserve the sanctity of vows and to minimize thoughtless dedications. For the 20 percent surcharge on property, see *27:15*, *19*, *31*.\n\n
27:14	idm16014					 The Hebrew term translated as **dedicates** is quite strong and means “declares holy.” • This ruling would apply only to a **house** in a walled town. Other houses, whether in unwalled villages or on open land, reverted to the owner in the Year of Jubilee (*25:29-31*). If the owner decided to redeem it, he had to pay a surcharge of **20 percent**. If the house was not redeemed in the first year, it became the property of the sanctuary and priests, and it could be used however they wished.\n\n
27:16	idm16024					 The price for dedicating a **field** was determined by **the number of years** remaining **until the next Year of Jubilee** (see *25:24-28*). If this property was not redeemed, it became the property of the priests to do with as they wished. The price of redeeming a field was 120 percent of the valuation (see *27:11-13*). If a landowner dedicated his field without redeeming it, it did not revert to his family in the Year of Jubilee.\n\n
27:21	idm16035					 **Year of Jubilee:** See *25:8-55*. • **specially set apart:** An acceptable vow devoting something to the Lord made it holy; it could not be redeemed.\n\n
27:25	idm16044					 Each of the **gerahs** weighed about 0.02 ounces or 0.6 grams.\n\n
27:26	idm16051					 **You may not dedicate:** Every **firstborn** male, be it man or animal, already belonged to God (*Exod 13:2*; *34:19-20*). Therefore, dedicating a firstborn was a useless exercise. The priest clearly had a use for the firstborn of animals fit for food or sacrifice (clean animals). The **firstborn** of a ceremonially unclean animal such as a donkey could be redeemed for 20 percent more than its value. Human firstborns had to be redeemed (*Exod 13:11-13*).\n\n
27:28	idm16063					 **specially set apart** (Hebrew *kherem*): Such an act of devotion was irrevocable. The person, animal, or property devoted this way was dedicated to the service of the sanctuary in a manner defined by the priest.\n\n
27:29	idm16071					 **set apart for destruction** (Hebrew *kherem*): The context here is the war for the conquest of Canaan, when cities, animals, and people deemed holy to some other god were set apart to be destroyed.\n\n
27:30	idm16079					 **One-tenth** (the “tithe”) of the harvest belonged **to the** Lord (*Deut 14:22-26*; cp. *Lev 23:10-14*). Members of the tribe of Levi, the priests and Levites, received no tribal lands. Accordingly, they were allotted one tenth of all produce from those who did own land (*Num 18:21-29*). This tithe was set aside every year (*Deut 14:22*) and was taken to the sanctuary; part of it was eaten there in a ritual meal (*Deut 14:23-26*). A second tithe was paid locally every third year to the local Levites and the poor (*Deut 14:27-29*; *26:12*; contrast *Amos 4:4*). The Levites then paid a tithe of what they received to the Tabernacle priests (*Num 18:26*), who used it to support themselves and maintain the sanctuary. Some interpreters think there were three tithes, the first paid to the Levites, the second consumed at the sanctuary, and the third paid every third year for the poor. Others suggest that there was just one tithe, paid at the sanctuary for two years, then paid locally every third year.\n\n
27:31	idm16097					 The penalty to **buy back** the tithed harvest was the same amount assessed for an individual who had accidentally withheld his tithe (see *5:16*).\n\n
27:32	idm16105					 Just like the produce of the fields (*27:29-34*), the flocks and herds were also tithed to the Lord.\n\n
27:34	idm16112					 The book closes as it opened (see *1:1*), clearly noting the divine origin of its contents as mediated through Moses.\n\n
