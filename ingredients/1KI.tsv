1:1	idm39671					 The book of 1 Kings opens by emphasizing the continuity of the Lord’s covenant with David (see *2 Sam 7:11-16*). Solomon was the legitimate and divinely chosen heir to what God had granted his father David. The challenges to Solomon’s succession to the throne (*1 Kgs 1:1–2:46*) foreshadowed challenges to his kingship at the end of his reign (*11:1-43*) and the continuing struggles between Israel and Judah thereafter.\n\n
1:1	idm39680					 At seventy years of age (*2 Sam 5:4-5*), David was feeble, perhaps because of years of warfare and stress. He needed a young person to impart warmth, a medical remedy also described in Josephus’s *Antiquities* and by the Greek physician Galen. David’s diminishing powers encouraged Adonijah’s attempts to take the throne.\n\n
1:5	idm39688					 **Adonijah** was **David’s** fourth **son**. Because his older brothers, Amnon, Daniel, and Absalom, were all dead, Adonijah assumed he would succeed **his father**. Yet, in keeping with ancient Near Eastern custom, Solomon—the son of David’s favored wife, Bathsheba—was to succeed him as king. David had already communicated this fact to Solomon (*1:13*, *17*; *1 Chr 22:6-10*). Adonijah’s self-seeking nature, likely encouraged by his father’s lax discipline, surfaced in his declaration, **“I will make myself king.”**\n\n
1:7	idm39702					 **Joab**, David’s military commander, and **Abiathar**, the high **priest**, gave **Adonijah** powerful military and religious backing in his pursuit of the throne.\n\n
1:8	idm39712					 Solomon also had influential friends supporting his right to become king. **Zadok** was in the priestly line of Eleazar, **Benaiah** commanded David’s **bodyguard** and his thirty mighty men (*2 Sam 23:20-23*), **Shimei** was one of Solomon’s district governors (*1 Kgs 4:18*), and **Nathan** was David’s trusted **prophet**. **Rei** is unknown beyond this verse.\n\n
1:9	idm39727					 **En-rogel** (modern Bir Ayyub, “Job’s well”) lay south of Jerusalem at the intersection of the Kidron and Hinnom valleys. Earlier, it harbored David’s two informants, Jonathan and Ahimaaz, during Absalom’s rebellion (see *2 Sam 17:17*).\n\n
1:11	idm39735					 **Bathsheba** was Solomon’s mother and David’s favored wife. Their affair led to the death of Bathsheba’s husband, Uriah the Hittite (see *2 Sam 11:1-27*). • **Nathan,** the prophet who revealed God’s covenant with David (*2 Sam 7:1-17*) and announced God’s love for Solomon at his birth (*2 Sam 12:24-25*), confirmed God’s selection of **Solomon** to succeed David as king (see *1 Chr 28:4-7*). Although Nathan had sharply rebuked David for his affair with Bathsheba and his murder of Uriah (*2 Sam 12:1-15*), the king respected the prophet. • **Adonijah** certainly observed Nathan’s close association with Bathsheba and Solomon. All three could expect to be killed if Adonijah’s plot to seize the throne succeeded (see *1 Kgs 15:29*; *16:11*).\n\n
1:28	idm39752					 **David** reassured **Bathsheba** that **Solomon** would **be the next king** by repeating his earlier **vow** in God’s name (see *1:17*).\n\n
1:31	idm39764					 **David** affirmed his pledge by ordering a public display of support by the priestly, prophetic, and military representatives, **Zadok**, **Nathan**, and **Benaiah.** \n\n
1:33	idm39774					 Riding the king’s **own mule** was a sign of prestige. In an ancient text from Mari, King Zimri-Lim was advised that royal protocol would be served by his riding in a donkey cart. David’s sons rode mules (*2 Sam 13:29*; *18:9*). Similarly Zechariah predicts that Israel’s king will come “riding on a donkey’s colt” (*Zech 9:9*), a prophecy fulfilled by Jesus (*Matt 21:4-7*; *John 12:14-15*). With Solomon mounted on David’s royal mule, the people would know that Solomon’s anointing as king had David’s blessing. • The **Gihon Spring**, just outside Jerusalem’s eastern slopes, was the city’s major water source. In this common gathering place, Solomon’s anointing would be well known, yet not visible to Adonijah’s supporters at En-rogel.\n\n
1:34	idm39787					 **Solomon**’s anointing followed established protocol in being administered by a **prophet** (see *1 Sam 16:1-13*). • **Priest**s also played significant roles in royal matters, and the populace would welcome **Zadok**’s blessing. David later confirmed Solomon’s kingship in a public ceremony (*1 Chr 29:22*).\n\n
1:35	idm39799					 **sit on my throne:** Due to David’s age and infirmities, Solomon officiated publicly for about two years before his father died. Co-regency provided for orderly royal succession and became commonplace during Israel’s divided monarchy. It was also practiced in Egypt. • The Hebrew term for **ruler,** used for various leadership positions, can have theological significance; the king was seen as both a spiritual and administrative leader of God’s people (see *Deut 31:10-11*; *1 Chr 28:4-6*; *Ps 89:3-4*; *Isa 55:3-4*).\n\n
1:38	idm39811					 **The king’s bodyguard** were foreign mercenaries from Crete; they served David throughout his reign (*2 Sam 8:18*; *15:18*; *20:7*).\n\n
1:39	idm39821					 **The priest . . . anointed Solomon** with **olive oil.** This act, a widely accepted Near Eastern practice, gave the ceremony divine sanction.\n\n
1:40	idm39829					 Those attending Adonijah’s banquet at En-rogel could not see the celebration, but it was so joyously **noisy** that they could hear it.\n\n
1:42	idm39836					 **Solomon** was proclaimed as **king** and warmly welcomed by the people. **Adonijah** and his followers panicked and fled, aborting the attempted coup.\n\n
1:50	idm39845					 Fearing for his life, **Adonijah** sought refuge at **the horns** (projections at the corners) **of the altar** (*Exod 27:2*), hoping for mercy according to biblical precedent (cp. *Exod 21:12-14*). However, such protection was provided only for unintentional homicide, so Adonijah’s treason could only be forgiven by the king. **Solomon** treated him graciously on the condition that he remain loyal. Appearances aside, Adonijah was still looking for ways to usurp the kingship and was later killed as a troublemaker (*1 Kgs 2:13-25*).\n\n
2:1	idm39858					 David gave his final charge to Solomon in two sections: personal advice for spiritual living (*2:2-4*) and instructions about people David had dealt with (*2:5-9*).\n\n
2:2	idm39866					 David’s advice to Solomon combined the spiritual and ethical standards of Deuteronomy, the standards of the covenant through Moses (see *Lev 18:4-5*; *Deut 5:33*; *6:4-5*; *8:6*; *10:12*), and the promises of the covenant with David (*2 Sam 7:12-16*, *25*). If Solomon would keep God’s standards of righteousness, the promises would be transmitted to his heir, who in turn could claim God’s blessings and convey them to subsequent generations (*Ps 89:3-4*, *20*, *24*, *27-37*). • The preeminent heir of David, the Messiah, would embody true righteousness (*Isa 11:1-5*), receive the full benefits of the covenant (*Jer 33:14-16*), and enact a new covenant with the people of Israel and Judah (*Jer 31:31-34*; *Ezek 34:24-31*; *37:24-28*). The New Testament reveals Jesus as that son of David who has come (*Matt 1:1*; *Rom 1:1-4*); he will come again to fulfill Old Testament prophecies and bless all people (*Luke 1:67-79*; *Gal 3:26-29*; *Rev 3:21*).\n\n
2:2	idm39893					 **Take courage and be a man:** God and Moses had given this same charge to Joshua at the time of the conquest (*Deut 31:6-7*; *Josh 1:6-7*, *9*). Joshua and Hezekiah gave this admonition to Israelite forces when facing enemies (*Josh 1:16-18*; *10:24-28*; *2 Chr 32:7*). David had learned the value of godly courage (*Pss 27:13-14*; *31:23-24*). When Paul urged Christians to be courageous (literally *be men*) and strong (*1 Cor 16:13*), he used the same words as the Greek Old Testament uses for the charges by Moses, Joshua, Hezekiah, and the Lord. An interesting parallel is found in the account of Bishop Polycarp’s martyrdom. As he was led into the stadium facing execution, Polycarp heard a voice from heaven saying, “Be strong, Polycarp, be a man!” (*Martyrdom of Polycarp* 9:1).\n\n
2:5	idm39911					 **Joab** had supported David’s bid for kingship but had become too ambitious. He had murdered former military rivals **Abner** (*2 Sam 3:22-30*) and **Amasa** (*2 Sam 20:10*), as well as David’s son Absalom (*2 Sam 18:1-18*). A party to David’s murder of Uriah the Hittite (*2 Sam 11:14-27*), Joab had grown very powerful (*2 Sam 20:23*), and his backing of Adonijah posed a serious threat to Solomon.\n\n
2:7	idm39925					 **Barzillai** unwaveringly supported David during his trouble with **Absalom**, while **Shimei** openly opposed David (*2 Sam 16:5-13*; *19:6-23*).\n\n
2:7	idm39936					 **at your table:** As he had done for Mephibosheth (*2 Sam 9:6-13*), David provided for **Barzillai** and his family. This privilege assured their continued loyalty.\n\n
2:8	idm39945					 **Mahanaim** was David’s refuge during Absalom’s rebellion (*2 Sam 17:24*). The Egyptian pharaoh, Shishak, invaded it during Rehoboam’s reign (see *1 Kgs 14:25*).\n\n
2:10	idm39954					 **David died** peacefully after a forty-year reign, knowing that the kingdom was **firmly established** in **Solomon**, his designated heir. Various locations have been proposed for David’s tomb, but none has been confirmed (cp. *Acts 2:29*). Royal tombs were used at least until Hezekiah’s days (*2 Kgs 20:21*).\n\n
2:13	idm39965					 **Adonijah** contradicted his supposed **peaceful intentions** when he declared, **the kingdom was rightfully mine.** \n\n
2:16	idm39974					 **let me marry Abishag:** Possessing the king’s concubine was a mark of royal legitimacy. When David became king, he was given Saul’s wives (*2 Sam 12:7-8*). The rebellious Absalom claimed David’s concubines (*2 Sam 16:20-22*).\n\n
2:19	idm39983					 **Solomon** understood the intentions behind Adonijah’s **small request**. Adonijah’s desire to **marry Abishag** could have launched a claim to the throne, whether or not she was officially in David’s harem.\n\n
2:22	idm39992					 Because **Adonijah** violated his terms of submission to **Solomon** (*1:52-53*), the king ordered **Benaiah** (see *1:8*, *26*, *38*) to execute him.\n\n
2:26	idm40005					 Solomon presumed that Adonijah’s chief supporters, **Abiathar** and **Joab**, remained involved in **Adonijah**’s schemes, so **Solomon** dealt with them as well.\n\n
2:26	idm40015					 **Abiathar** had treasonously supported Adonijah (*1:7*, *25*). But he was **deposed** rather than killed because he had **carried the Ark** (*2 Sam 15:24*, *29*, *35*), had supported David, and had **shared all his hardships**. Abiathar’s removal from the priesthood fulfilled the Lord’s word about the house of **Eli** in Ithamar’s line (*1 Sam 2:30-35*). Zadok’s appointment (*1 Kgs 4:2*) returned the high priesthood to Eleazar’s line as it had been before Eli (*Num 20:22-28*; *25:11-13*; *2 Sam 8:17*; *1 Chr 6:1-8*, *50-53*; *Ezra 7:2-5*) and as it continued throughout the divided monarchy (*2 Chr 31:10*; *Ezek 43:19*).\n\n
2:28	idm40041					 Following Adonijah’s example (*1:50*), **Joab** hoped to find mercy by grasping **the horns of the altar** according to the provisions of the law of Moses (*Exod 21:12-14*; *Num 35:22-25*; *Deut 19:4-5*). But because *Joab* was a murderer, he could not claim clemency (see *2 Sam 3:27*; *18:14*; *20:10*).\n\n
2:36	idm40057					 The confinement of **Shimei** prevented him from reaching his kinsmen in Benjamin to stir up trouble for the king.\n\n
2:39	idm40064					 **Shimei’s** journey to **Gath**, ostensibly to recover his runaway **slaves**, violated his agreement. Technically, he did not cross the Kidron Valley in going to *Gath,* but the penalty was understood by both parties to apply to Shimei’s going **anywhere else**. Because Shimei violated his **oath to the** Lord (*2:43*) and because of his past hostilities toward David (*2 Sam 16:5-13*; *19:16-23*), Solomon instructed **Benaiah** to execute him.\n\n
3:1	idm40081					 As was common in the ancient Near East, Solomon sealed a political **alliance** with the **king of Egypt** by marrying **one of his daughters.** The bestowal of an Egyptian princess and the city of Gezer to Solomon as a wedding present (*9:16*) demonstrated the Egyptians’ high regard for him. The pharaoh was probably Siamun, of Egypt’s weakened 21st dynasty. The alliance was mutually beneficial: **Pharaoh** gained access to trade routes through Israel, while **Solomon** increased security on his southern border. Apparently, Solomon had previously married the Ammonite Naamah (see *11:42-43* with *14:21*). • **City of David:** This section of Jerusalem was the old Jebusite city in the southern portion of the eastern ridge. When Solomon extended his building activities northward, he built a special palace for Pharaoh’s daughter (*7:8*; *9:24*; *2 Chr 8:11*).\n\n
3:2	idm40100					 The Ark of the Covenant sat in David’s tent in Jerusalem before the Temple was built, and **the people . . . sacrificed their offerings at local places of worship** (see *study note on 8:1*). However, this detracted from unified worship at a central sanctuary (*12:1-24*) and increased the danger of mixing with Canaanite religious practices. Israel’s worship at such places was forbidden (*Deut 12:1-14*).\n\n
3:4	idm40110					 God’s gift of wisdom to Solomon is narrated as a *chiasm* (a symmetrical arrangement in which sections A and B are mirrored by sections B’ and A’), drawing the focus in on Solomon’s transaction with the Lord: A: While he sacrificed at **Gibeon . . . the** Lord** appeared to Solomon in a dream** (*3:4-5*). B: Solomon prayed for wisdom to **govern** his **people** equitably and efficiently (*3:6-9*). B’: **The Lord** favorably answered his request and granted additional blessings (*3:10-14*). A’: Solomon awoke from the dream and offered additional sacrifices to the Lord (*3:15*).\n\n
3:4	idm40127					 The city of **Gibeon** lay six miles northwest of Jerusalem. Its altar, **the most important of these** [local] **places of worship** (literally *the great high place*), accommodated sacrifices of royal proportions. *Gibeon* was also the site of the Tabernacle (*1 Chr 16:39-40*; *21:29*; *2 Chr 1:2-6*).\n\n
3:6	idm40141					 The Hebrew word translated **faithful love** (*khesed*) expresses God’s gracious treatment and loving kindness toward humanity (*Ps 118:1-2*), especially to his covenant nation Israel (*Deut 7:9*, *12*).\n\n
3:7	idm40152					 The Hebrew term translated **little child** was often used of someone who lacked experience in his profession (“assistant,” *19:21*). Solomon humbly recognized his inexperience and his need for an **understanding heart**. If he desired to govern the **people well** and render proper decisions, he knew that he needed God’s help.\n\n
3:10	idm40162					 God **was pleased** with Solomon’s unselfish request and granted him **a wise and understanding heart.** These incomparable qualities are demonstrated in the next section (*3:16-28*) and as Solomon sets up his administration (ch *4*), business dealings, building activities, international relations, and worship practices (chs *5–10*).\n\n
3:15	idm40173					 Solomon’s sacrifice after the **dream** completes the narrative.\n\n
3:16	idm40180					 Solomon’s judgment concerning the real mother of the living baby illustrates his wisdom in cases of civil jurisprudence. Chapters *4–10* illustrate his wisdom in all areas of his rule.\n\n
3:16	idm40187					 **prostitutes:** While the law condemned prostitution (*Lev 19:29*; *Deut 23:18*), it still existed in ancient Israel. Though these women were of the most despised class of women in Israelite society, Solomon demonstrated his kindness and availability to all people by dealing justice to them as mothers, not as prostitutes.\n\n
3:28	idm40196					 Kings often claimed special **wisdom** and the ability to make just **decision**s. As God promised, Solomon’s wisdom was greater than that of other wise men (*4:29-34*; *10:6-9*, *23-24*).\n\n
4:2	idm40207					 Because **Zadok** was now quite old, his grandson (see *1 Chr 6:8-9*) **Azariah** succeeded him as high priest.\n\n
4:3	idm40216					 The **court secretaries** were state officials and Solomon’s private secretaries. **Shisha**, the father of **Elihoreph and Ahijah**, had served David in this capacity (*2 Sam 8:17*; *20:25*; *1 Chr 18:16*). • **The royal historian** functioned as chief of protocol for palace affairs and ceremonies. As in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, such officials often represented the king in important negotiations (see *2 Kgs 18:18*; *2 Chr 34:8*).\n\n
4:4	idm40231					 **Benaiah . . . Zadok and Abiathar:** All three men had also held special posts in David’s administration. Though deposed as high priest (*2:26-27*), *Abiathar* still functioned as a **priest**.\n\n
4:5	idm40241					 Two sons of **Nathan** also served in Solomon’s inner circle. **Azariah** supervised the twelve **district governors**, while **Zabud . . . was a trusted adviser**, a post held by Hushai under David (*2 Sam 15:37*).\n\n
4:6	idm40252					 **Ahishar** functioned as **manager of the palace property**, an office that became powerful under Uzziah’s son Jotham (*2 Kgs 15:5*). Later, this position was held by Eliakim, one of Hezekiah’s representatives, who met with emissaries from King Sennacherib of Assyria during negotiations concerning the siege of Jerusalem (*2 Kgs 18:18*). • **Adoniram** was head of the corvée (the system of **forced labor**). Samuel had warned about this loathsome institution (*1 Sam 8:12-17*), and the leaders of Israel later complained about it to Solomon’s son Rehoboam (*1 Kgs 12:4*).\n\n
4:7	idm40266					 The **twelve district governors** probably handled lesser administrative duties, such as securing revenue and **providing food for the king’s household.** Solomon’s twelve districts did not exactly coincide with the old tribal allotments.\n\n
4:20	idm40274					 God’s promise to Abraham (*Gen 15:18-21*; *17:8*; *22:17*) finds historical fulfillment in his blessing of **Solomon.** The surrounding lands conquered by David and *Solomon* (*2 Chr 8:3*) remained loyal to Solomon. They **sent tribute money . . . and continued to serve him throughout** his long reign.\n\n
4:22	idm40287					 Solomon’s court was enormous and splendid, as indicated by its **daily food requirements**.\n\n
4:24	idm40294					 **each family had its own home and garden:** Solomon’s subjects lived under ideal conditions that foreshadowed the coming messianic era (*Mic 4:4*), enjoying widespread prosperity and tranquility.\n\n
4:26	idm40302					 **4,000 stalls:** The number *4,000* reflects the parallel text in *2 Chr 9:25*, a suitable number for Solomon’s 1,400 chariots (*1 Kgs 10:26*; *2 Chr 1:14*). • **12,000 horses:** The Hebrew can be translated as “horsemen” (*Exod 15:19-21*) or “horses” (*Joel 2:4*). To be prepared for battles, Solomon built towns to accommodate his forces (*1 Kgs 9:19*).\n\n
4:29	idm40317					 **wise men of the East:** Babylon was well-known for wise men. Yet Solomon’s God-given **wisdom** (*3:9*, *12*, *28*; *Prov 1:7*; *Eccl 12:13*) exceeded them all (*1 Kgs 4:34*).\n\n
4:31	idm40331					 **Ethan** and **Heman** were among the musicians appointed by David (see *1 Chr 6:33-47*; *15:16-19*; *Pss 88*, *89*). • **The sons of Mahol** were Temple singers, so **Heman, Calcol, and Darda** may have participated in the worship services (see *1 Chr 15:17*, *19-22*).\n\n
4:32	idm40347					 **proverbs . . . songs:** Solomon wrote much of the book of Proverbs and composed *Pss 72* and *127*. His knowledge of **plants** and **animals** reflected his careful observation of nature (see *Prov 6:6-8*). Solomon’s wisdom and literary prowess (see *Matt 12:42*) are reflected in the Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes. No wonder many, including **kings** (*1 Kgs 10:1-9*), sought **the wisdom of Solomon.** \n\n
5:1	idm40363					 **King Hiram of Tyre had . . . been a loyal friend of David** (*2 Sam 5:11-12*). This might mean that the two shared a covenantal relationship (a treaty). Hiram was a valuable ally and commercial partner (*1 Kgs 5:7-11*, *18*; *9:11*, *26-28*; *10:22*). His name is a shortened form of Ahiram, a name seen elsewhere in Phoenician inscriptions.\n\n
5:2	idm40376					 **Solomon** responded to **Hiram** by sending word through Hiram’s ambassadors that he intended to **build a Temple to honor the name of the** Lord**,** following his father David’s desire and provisions for its construction (*2 Sam 7:1-3*; *1 Chr 17:1-15*; *22:14-19*; *28:9-12*).\n\n
5:3	idm40391					 **gave him victory over all his enemies** (literally *put them under the soles of his feet*): Ancient Near Eastern inscriptions and paintings often depict victorious kings with their feet upon the necks of vanquished foes or with enemies subdued at their feet.\n\n
5:4	idm40399					 Unlike David, Solomon enjoyed **peace** [literally *rest*] **on every side.** Solomon’s name (Hebrew *shlomoh*) may be a variation of the word for “peace” (Hebrew *shalom*). • **The name of the** Lord signifies God’s self-revealed character and reputation. The Hebrew term translated *the name* was sometimes used in oral reading of Scripture so the reader could avoid uttering the personal name of God (the tetragrammaton—YHWH). The New Testament applies the term “the name” to Jesus (*Acts 5:41*; *3 Jn 1:7*).\n\n
5:6	idm40415					 **please command:** The main thrust of Solomon’s message was his request for **cedars from Lebanon**, indicating Hiram’s wide commercial influence. Ancient Near Eastern literature often cites the use of Lebanese *cedars* in building and furnishing temples and palaces. • **Sidonians** was a general name for Phoenicians; Sidon was more ancient than Tyre.\n\n
5:7	idm40425					 Hiram’s **reply to Solomon** confirmed and perpetuated the cordial relations that he had with David. The venture was mutually beneficial. Solomon received needed construction materials for the Temple; in return, he supplied necessities for Hiram’s **household** (*5:9-10*) and paid Hiram’s workers (*5:6*). The passage illustrates the Phoenicians’ skillful commercial enterprises and Solomon’s immense wealth, and it again emphasizes Solomon’s God-given **wisdom.** The largely commercial venture led to **a formal alliance of peace** (*5:12*).\n\n
5:7	idm40438					 **Praise the** Lord**:** Hiram did not acknowledge Israel’s God as his own but, following ancient Near Eastern protocol, he politely recognized Solomon’s God (see *10:9*; *2 Kgs 18:22-25*; *Ezra 1:2-4*; *6:12*; *Dan 2:47*; *3:29*; *6:26-27*).\n\n
5:13	idm40454					 This passage describes Solomon’s work force and the division of **labor**. Forced labor was a common practice in the ancient Near East (see *study note on 4:6*).\n\n
5:13	idm40462					 Aliens with permanent residency in **Israel** comprised the bulk of Solomon’s **labor force**. Native Israelites were apparently temporary supervisors for Solomon’s building projects (*9:22-23*; *11:28*).\n\n
5:16	idm40472					 **3,600 foremen:** In 2 Chronicles (*2 Chr 2:2*, *17-18*; *8:10*) the *foremen* total 3,600 non-Israelite and 250 Israelite chief supervisors. The numbers in the Hebrew text of *1 Kgs 5:16* and *9:23* are 3,300 *foremen* and 550 chief supervisors. It is possible that 250 of the chief supervisors were Israelites, with 300 non-Israelites holding the same rank.\n\n
5:17	idm40486					 **Large blocks of high-quality stone** were probably cut to size (see *7:10*) in a quarry near Jerusalem (*6:7*). The need to handle these massive stones is probably what led Solomon to institute forced labor. The craftsmen included **men from . . . Gebal** (Byblos), a port known for exporting timber, according to ancient Egyptian inscriptions.\n\n
6:1	idm40496					 The building of the Temple and palace complex and the celebration of the Temple dedication are central to the 1 Kings account of Solomon’s era. The Temple, erected to glorify God, was Israel’s most important building, so the writer of 1 Kings carefully recorded details of its construction.\n\n
6:1	idm40502					 Solomon’s **fourth year** was about 967 BC. Treating the number **480** as representing calendar years yields a date of about 1446 BC for Israel’s exodus from **Egypt.** Those who view the number as symbolic (12 generations times 40 years each) suggest that the Exodus occurred at a later date, around 1270 BC (see *Exodus Book Introduction*, “The Date of the Exodus”).\n\n
6:2	idm40515					 Like the Tabernacle before it, the **Temple** (literally *house*) was the place where God met with his people. David had stored up materials to be used in its construction (*1 Chr 22:2-4*, *14*) and had drawn up plans for the Temple and given them to **Solomon** (*1 Chr 28:11-12*). The Temple’s floor plan resembled that of the Tabernacle but doubled its length and width and increased its height (cp. *Exod 26:3*, *15-30*; *36:26-34*).\n\n
6:3	idm40530					 Unlike the Tabernacle, the **Temple** had an east **entry room** (or porch) and two freestanding pillars before the entrance (*7:15-22*).\n\n
6:11	idm40539					 **The** Lord had an encouraging **message** for **Solomon.** Because God appeared to Solomon before (*3:5*) and after (*9:2*) this event, this *message* probably came to him by a prophet. The words reminded the king of God’s prior **promise** (*3:14*): If Solomon remained faithful to God, the Temple that he was building would become an eternal dwelling place for God.\n\n
6:14	idm40554					 The focus shifts to the **Temple** interior. While the Temple site is not mentioned here, the Chronicler located it at the former threshing floor of Araunah (*1 Chr 21:18-25*; *2 Chr 3:1*). This site is traditionally thought to be the location of Mount Moriah (*Gen 22:2*). Solomon’s Temple was in the northeastern corner of Jerusalem (now called the “old city”) in the area now associated with the Dome of the Rock.\n\n
6:15	idm40564					 **paneled with wood:** The interior walls were **paneled with cedar from floor to ceiling** so that no exterior stones could be seen. The effect was exquisitely beautiful, reflecting painstaking care and great expense.\n\n
6:19	idm40572					 Following the pattern of the Tabernacle, the **inner sanctuary**, which was **overlaid . . . inside with solid gold**, was separated from the main room of **the Temple** by a curtain (*2 Chr 3:14*) and **gold chains**. Like the Most Holy Place in the Tabernacle, the *inner sanctuary* was a perfect cube. It housed the **Ark of the** Lord**’s Covenant** that symbolized God’s presence. The place of atonement was atop the *Ark* (*Exod 25:17*); the high priest annually made propitiation for the Israelites by sprinkling the sacrificial blood of the atonement on it (*Lev 16:1-19*). • The **altar that belonged to the Most Holy Place** stood in the main room. The priests burned incense there daily (*Exod 30:34-38*; *37:25-29*). The altar was made of **cedar** and covered with *gold.* • Like the *inner sanctuary,* the main room was also completely *overlaid with gold,* which reminded the priests that Almighty God was present. The main room also housed ten golden lampstands, ten tables (*2 Chr 4:7-8*), and other furnishings (*1 Kgs 7:48-50*).\n\n
6:23	idm40599					 In the **inner sanctuary** were **two cherubim** (see *study note on 1 Chr 28:18*) made of **olive wood** and **overlaid . . . with gold.** Standing like sentries facing the door (*2 Chr 3:13*), their combined wingspan reached from wall to wall. Along with the two smaller *cherubim* facing each other atop the Ark (*Exod 25:17-21*), they symbolized the awesome presence of the Most Holy God.\n\n
6:36	idm40613					 The **inner courtyard** surrounding the **Temple** was restricted to the priests (*2 Chr 4:9*) and contained the bronze altar (*2 Chr 4:1*), the bronze Sea (*1 Kgs 7:23-26*; *2 Chr 4:2-5*), and ten carts that could hold ten basins of water for purification (*1 Kgs 7:27-40*; *2 Chr 4:6*).\n\n
6:38	idm40627					 **midautumn, in the month of Bul:** The year was 960 BC. \n\n
7:1	idm40635					 Before describing the Temple’s furnishings, the writer mentions the construction of Solomon’s **palace** complex. The multiple buildings within this complex took nearly twice as long to build (**thirteen years**) as the Temple (**seven years**, *6:38*). The entire building project took twenty years (*9:10*). Although construction details are brief, archaeological discovery of two of Solomon’s buildings provides an idea of how this palace might have looked. Despite its grandeur, Solomon’s palace is not the author’s focus; his interest is in the Temple, God’s dwelling place.\n\n
7:2	idm40646					 **The Palace of the Forest of Lebanon** was named for the abundant use of **cedar** in its construction. It would house 300 gold shields (*10:16-17*) and possibly served as both treasury and armory (see *12:25-28*; *Isa 22:8*). The Egyptian pharaoh Shishak later carried away the shields as booty (*1 Kgs 14:27*).\n\n
7:6	idm40658					 The **Hall of Pillars** was apparently a colonnaded entry to the **Hall of Justice**, where Solomon **sat to hear legal matters** (see also *10:18-20*). Similar throne rooms have been found in Syria and Mesopotamia. • Solomon erected separate **living quarters for Pharaoh’s daughter** (see *3:1*; *9:24*; *2 Chr 8:11*).\n\n
7:9	idm40672					 As with the Temple, the **stones** for Solomon’s palace complex were **high-quality stone, cut . . . and trimmed to exact** specifications. Similar stonework has been found at Megiddo. **Cedar beams** between the courses of the wall provided better protection against earthquakes.\n\n
7:12	idm40681					 **The great courtyard** that encircled the Temple and palace complex provided a gathering place for the people (see *Jer 7:1-2*; *36:10*).\n\n
7:13	idm40690					 **Huram:** Like his father, he was a master **craftsman in bronze** and other materials (*2 Chr 2:12-14*). His skillful **metal work** is detailed in the following verses (*1 Kgs 7:15-50*). • **skillful and talented** (literally *filled with wisdom and* *understanding and knowledge*): The Israelites placed great emphasis on practical skills and considered them a form of wisdom (*Prov 22:29*).\n\n
7:15	idm40705					 The **two bronze pillars** were probably free-standing since the narrator describes them here rather than in the earlier discussion of the Temple structure (*6:3-6*).\n\n
7:23	idm40713					 The giant bronze basin **called the Sea** replaced the smaller bronze washbasin used in the Tabernacle service (see *Exod 30:17-21*). The Sea was cast as one solid piece, excluding the **twelve bronze oxen** on which it sat. The oxen were placed so that **three faced** each direction, perhaps to remind priests that they served God on behalf of all twelve tribes of Israel. Ahaz later replaced the oxen with a stone base (*2 Kgs 16:17*). The priests used the Sea, like the bronze washbasin before it, for ceremonial washing (*2 Chr 4:6*) as they prepared to minister before God (see *Exod 30:17-21*). The apparent discrepancy in the volume of water it could hold (see *2 Chr 4:5*) is probably due to standards of measurement that varied according to place and time.\n\n
7:27	idm40727					 The **ten bronze water carts** each held a basin for rinsing burnt offerings (*2 Chr 4:6*). **Five** stood on either side of the **Temple.** Because they had **wheels,** they could be moved as needed.\n\n
7:40	idm40738					 **Huram** had great skill in casting items of varying size and complexity. He also made the bronze altar for the inner court that was used for burnt offerings (*2 Chr 4:1*).\n\n
7:46	idm40746					 **between Succoth and Zarethan:** This area east of the Jordan River (see *Josh 3:16*; *Judg 8:4-5*) was known for metallurgy. Abundant clay for molds, wood for fuel, and a prevailing north wind facilitated the casting process.\n\n
7:48	idm40755					 **The gold altar** replaced the altar for burning incense used in the Tabernacle (*Exod 30:1-10*). The one table and one lampstand used in the Tabernacle (*Exod 25:23-40*) were replaced by ten such sets in the Temple. Although the author lists a single **gold table for the Bread of the Presence,** the Chronicler reports ten tables, five on each side of the Temple’s main room (cp. *2 Chr 4:8*), along with ten **lampstands of solid gold**. The bread represented God’s provision for his people, and the lampstand characterized God as the source of life and truth. Both symbols pointed to Christ, the bread of life (*John 6:35*) and the light of the world (*John 8:12*).\n\n
7:50	idm40769					 The writer emphasizes Solomon’s abundant use of gold in furnishing the Temple. David and the people had collected an enormous amount of gold to be used for the Temple (*1 Chr 29:1-9*), and Solomon also amassed gold annually (*1 Kgs 10:14*), so he had a ready supply (see *10:21*).\n\n
8:1	idm40778					 Solomon’s building activities climaxed with the Ark’s move to the newly erected Temple. The king offered both prayer (*8:22-53*) and words of praise and blessing (*8:56-61*) to dedicate the Temple for the Lord’s service. After the dedication, the assembled gathering enjoyed the great Festival of Shelters. The focus of the account is on Solomon praising God and blessing the people (*8:12-61*).\n\n
8:1	idm40787					 The **Ark** was being kept in a tent in the **City of David** (*2 Sam 6:3-17*; *1 Chr 13:7-14*; *15:1–16:43*). Solomon had gone there earlier to sacrifice after the Lord appeared to him in a dream in Gibeon (*1 Kgs 3:4-15*).\n\n
8:2	idm40799					 Although the Temple was completed in the eighth month (*6:38*), Solomon apparently delayed the dedication until the following year so it could take place **at the annual Festival of Shelters, which is held in early autumn in the month of Ethanim**. This schedule allowed time to prepare for the spectacular celebration and gave the occasion double significance. As prescribed in the law, Solomon and the people expressed their gratitude to God for the completed harvest season. They also celebrated the fulfillment of Moses’ song of deliverance, which promised that God would one day settle his people in the Promised Land and make his dwelling there (*Exod 15:17*; *Deut 12:10-14*). Solomon’s dedicatory prayer and blessing may indicate that he was consciously leading his people in covenantal renewal, as prescribed in *Deut 31:10-13*, in the seventh month of the seventh year of his reign.\n\n
8:3	idm40810					 **The priests and Levites brought up the Ark of the** Lord as prescribed in the law (*Exod 25:14-15*; *Num 4:5-8*; cp. *2 Sam 6:1-15*).\n\n
8:5	idm40821					 The incalculable sacrifices by the Israelites marked both the joy and the solemnity of this occasion.\n\n
8:8	idm40827					 In accordance with the law (*Exod 25:15*), the carrying **poles** were required to stay with the Ark.\n\n
8:9	idm40835					 The focus on the **two stone tablets** that Moses placed in the Ark (cp. *8:21*; see *Exod 25:21*; *Deut 31:26*) suggests that Solomon had in mind both a renewal of the Mosaic covenant and the Temple dedication.\n\n
8:10	idm40845					 As **the priests came out of the Holy Place**, they were greeted with music praising the Lord (*2 Chr 5:11-14*). Previously, **the glorious presence of the** Lord had filled the Tabernacle (*Exod 40:34-35*). Now it filled the **Temple** to show that God was again dwelling among his people. Ezekiel recorded its later departure from the Temple (*Ezek 10:18-19*), to return at a blessed future time (*Ezek 43:1-5*). In the New Testament, John wrote that God dwells among his people through his son, Jesus Christ (*John 1:14*). Paul affirmed that Christ now dwells in each believer (*Col 1:27*) as a foretaste of a future when “God’s home is . . . among his people” (*Rev 21:3*).\n\n
8:12	idm40862					 Solomon began with prayer (*8:12-13*), then blessed the people while praising God for fulfilling his promises (*8:14-21*). As in many praise psalms, Solomon elevated God, subordinated himself, and testified to God’s great goodness.\n\n
8:12	idm40870					 **thick cloud of darkness:** Solomon recognized the cloud filling the inner sanctuary as a manifestation of God’s presence, but he also understood that God could not be contained in a man-made **Temple** (see *8:27*). Solomon fulfilled his commission to build the Temple (*8:19*; *1 Chr 28:10*), believing the promises that God would dwell in the sanctuary (see *Exod 15:17*).\n\n
8:14	idm40882					 Solomon’s **blessing** was expressed as praise to God, who had kept his covenant promises and blessed his people (see *2 Sam 7:12-16*; cp. *2 Chr 6:1-11*).\n\n
8:22	idm40891					 Like Solomon’s preceding prayer, his prayer of dedication for the Temple praised God and blessed the people. He emphasized God’s covenant faithfulness and his own role in building the Temple and prayed for God’s continued response to their prayers (*8:22-30*). Solomon then made seven distinct petitions to God (*8:31-53*) and concluded with a blessing (*8:54-61*).\n\n
8:22	idm40900					 As Solomon prayed, he **lifted his hands toward heaven** and knelt before the Lord on a platform erected in clear view of the congregation (*8:54*; *2 Chr 6:13*). Jesus condemned hypocritical individuals who displayed religiosity without true, heartfelt belief (*Matt 6:5-8*). But Solomon’s public piety was genuine, leading his people in worship and encouraging them to live in full dependence upon God. The nation that knows and obeys the Lord, and whose leaders rule in righteousness, is particularly blessed (*2 Chr 7:14*; *Pss 33:12*; *45:6-7*; *144:15*; *Prov 29:2*; *Isa 11:1-5*).\n\n
8:23	idm40916					 Solomon’s prayer affirmed God’s incomparable nature and the fulfillment of his promises to David. Solomon also prayed that God would keep his promise that David’s **descendants . . . will always sit on the throne.**\n\n
8:29	idm40923					 Solomon asked God to hear the prayers of his people from the Temple. He then addressed specific instances in which they would need God’s answers.\n\n
8:31	idm40929					 Solomon asked that God render the proper decision and carry out justice in court cases when the litigant’s **innocence** could not be determined due to a lack of witnesses (cp. *Exod 22:7-12*). Perhaps Solomon realized that later officials would not have the special wisdom God had given him (*1 Kgs 3:12*; e.g., *3:16-27*).\n\n
8:33	idm40939					 Solomon asked concerning future situations when the people of Israel **sinned** and God allowed the enemy to defeat them (see *Lev 26:14-17*; *Deut 28:15*, *25-26*, *45*, *49*; *Josh 7*) and then the people genuinely repented. Solomon asked that God honor his covenant and **forgive** them (*Lev 26:39-42*).\n\n
8:35	idm40954					 Solomon prayed about drought brought on by the people’s sin (*Lev 26:19*; *Deut 28:23-24*). Solomon prayed that if the people confessed and truly repented, God would **forgive** them and restore fertility to the land so that the people would learn to live righteously before God.\n\n
8:37	idm40963					 Solomon prayed concerning various disasters caused by individual or corporate sin (*Lev 26:16*, *19-26*; *Deut 28:21-22*, *38-40*, *42*, *58-61*). Solomon again asked that if God’s people confessed and truly repented, God would deal justly so that all might live in reverence before him (*Deut 8:6*; *2 Chr 7:14*; *Prov 1:7*; *9:10*; *15:33*).\n\n
8:41	idm40980					 Solomon asked that non-Israelites would learn to **fear** the Lord and live in relationship with him. Solomon realized that Israel must properly represent the Lord to those outside the covenant (see *Gen 12:7*; *Ps 102:15*; *Hab 2:14*; *Matt 28:19*).\n\n
8:44	idm40991					 On behalf of those without access to the **Temple,** particularly when far away fighting for God’s cause (*Lev 26:7-8*; *Deut 20:1-4*), Solomon asked that God hear their prayers directed toward the Lord and his *Temple* in Jerusalem (see *Dan 6:10*).\n\n
8:46	idm41002					 Solomon prayed concerning a time when Israel might be carried away **captive** (*Lev 26:33*). Solomon prayed that if the people genuinely repented and confessed their sin, God would listen, forgive them, and grant them favor with **their captors** (*Lev 26:40-45*; *2 Kgs 25:27-30*; *Dan 6:10*; *9:3-19*).\n\n
8:52	idm41015					 Solomon concluded his prayer of dedication with a general petition for God to be accessible to all of Israel and respond to their requests. Returning to the theme of the Exodus (*8:16*), Solomon reminded God that he had selected Israel as his **special possession** (*Exod 19:5*; *Deut 7:6*; *14:1-2*; *26:18*; *Ps 135:4*; cp. *Titus 2:11-14*; *1 Pet 2:9-10*).\n\n
8:54	idm41030					 Solomon praised God’s faithfulness and goodness to Israel in giving the people **rest** as **promised** (see *Josh 21:43-45*; *23:14*; *2 Sam 7:1*). Some Israelites failed to appropriate the rest that only God provides (*Ps 95:10-11*; *Heb 3:7-19*; *4:1-11*).\n\n
8:57	idm41044					 Solomon asked that God continue to be with his people and mold them into an obedient and faithful nation. Through God’s grace and their faithfulness, Israel could experience God’s righteous justice and teach people **all over the earth** that **the** Lord** alone is God**.\n\n
8:62	idm41054					 The closing **sacrifices** (see *Deut 12:5-14*) and the observance of **the Festival of Shelters** close the narrative frame that was opened with the sacrifices made when the Ark was installed in the Most Holy Place (*1 Kgs 8:1-11*; cp. *2 Chr 7:1-6*).\n\n
8:65	idm41065					 **Lebo-hamath** to the **north** in Aram and **the Brook of Egypt** (Wadi al Arish) to the south are the geographic boundaries that defined the Promised Land (*Josh 13:5*; *15:4*). • **seven days for the dedication of the altar and seven days for the Festival of Shelters:** When the seven days for the dedication were completed, the *Festival of Shelters* was observed for another seven days.\n\n
9:2	idm41078					 **The** Lord had previously **appeared to Solomon** when granting his desire for wisdom (*3:3-15*). The Chronicler provides additional details of God’s blessings or judgment, depending on the faithfulness of Solomon and Israel (*2 Chr 7:11-22*).\n\n
9:3	idm41089					 The Lord answered Solomon’s **prayer** by reviewing the conditions of the covenant. Obedience would bring prosperity and the Lord’s blessing; disobedience could mean utter disaster, including destruction of the city and Temple, and deportation of God’s people (see *Deut 28:36-37*, *63-68*). Although God’s covenant was irrevocable, receiving its blessings depended upon faithfulness to its terms (*Ps 89:24-37*).\n\n
9:10	idm41099					 In Solomon’s business agreement with **King Hiram**, he exchanged wheat and olive oil for timber and **gold** (*5:10-11*). When **Solomon** became indebted to Hiram, he gave him **twenty towns in . . . Galilee** as compensation. However, Hiram was dissatisfied with the towns, so he returned them to Solomon’s control (see *2 Chr 8:2*). The two friends settled upon other means of compensation and remained active allies and trading partners (*1 Kgs 9:26-28*; *10:22*).\n\n
9:15	idm41113					 Solomon used **forced labor** to complete many building projects (*4:6*; *5:13-18*; *9:20-23*; *12:4*, *18-19*; cp. *1 Sam 8:10-18*).\n\n
9:15	idm41126					 Solomon strengthened the **supporting terraces***,* which were on a slope of the southeastern ridge in the traditional City of David area of Jerusalem (see *2 Sam 5:9*), and the **wall of Jerusalem.** He also fortified the key cities of **Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.** Archaeological research shows that the walls and gates of all three cities have distinctive traits attributable to Solomon’s time. *Hazor,* in the north, was a first line of defense against invasion. *Megiddo,* in the Plain of Sharon, also had strategic military importance (*2 Kgs 23:29-30*; *Rev 16:12-16*).\n\n
9:16	idm41141					 **Gezer**, west of Jerusalem, was not previously occupied by Israelites. It was conquered by the Egyptian pharaoh and given to his daughter as a wedding gift when she married Solomon. An inscription in the Amon Temple in Tanis, apparently depicting a victory by the 21st dynasty Pharaoh Siamun (978–959 BC) against a Philistine campaign, suggests that Siamun was the pharaoh involved.\n\n
9:17	idm41150					 **Lower Beth-horon** was an important defensive site for western Judah. Several cities in Canaan were called **Baalath**; the one here was probably also known as Kiriath-jearim (*2 Sam 6:2*; see *Josh 15:9*; *1 Chr 13:5*, *6*). **Tamar** was probably located in the southeastern quarter of the Holy Land (see *Ezek 47:19*; *48:28*).\n\n
9:20	idm41165					 Solomon’s conscripted **slaves** were made up of early Canaanite settlers; 550 chief supervisors, of whom 250 were Israelites, superintended the **forced laborers** (*2 Chr 8:9-10*; see *1 Kgs 5:15-16* with *2 Chr 2:17-18*).\n\n
9:21	idm41176					 **completely destroyed:** See “*Complete Destruction*” Theme Note.\n\n
9:24	idm41184					 The **new palace** Solomon **built for . . . Pharaoh’s daughter** was separate from Solomon’s own residence because his palace was deemed holy, “for the Ark of the Lord has been there” (*2 Chr 8:11*). The place where the Ark resided was considered sacred, since it embodied God’s presence and sanctified its surroundings (*Exod 25:22*; see also *2 Sam 6:7*; *1 Chr 15:11-13*).\n\n
9:25	idm41197					 **Three times each year Solomon** provided exemplary leadership for Israel as he **presented . . . offerings** at the national festivals of Unleavened Bread, Harvest (or Pentecost, or Weeks), and Shelters (*Deut 16:16*).\n\n
9:26	idm41206					 The seaport of **Ezion-geber** was situated on the Gulf of Aqaba, which opens onto the **Red Sea.** The location of **Ophir** is uncertain but may have been located in southwestern Arabia, eastern Africa, or India; the mention of **gold** and other precious commodities (see *10:11-12*) indicates its strategic importance for trade.\n\n
10:1	idm41217					 The queen of Sheba visited to test the accuracy of accounts concerning Solomon’s wisdom (*10:1*, *3*, *6-7*). She may also have sought commercial partnership (*10:2*, *10*, *13*). All of Solomon’s accomplishments resulted from his God-given wisdom, as the queen of Sheba testifies in the central speech of the narrative (*10:6-9*).\n\n
10:1	idm41230					 **The queen** likely **heard** tales of **Solomon’s** wisdom and wealth because of his trading ventures to Ophir (*10:11*; see *9:26-28*). **Sheba**, located in southwestern Arabia (modern Yemen), was a notably fertile commercial center. The trading enterprises of the ancient Sabeans encompassed great swaths of territory, including Syria, Africa, and India. • **test . . . with hard questions** (literally *riddles*): Arabian literature is famous for its riddles and proverbs. The queen tested Solomon’s wisdom and explored perplexities of her own.\n\n
10:2	idm41244					 The queen of Sheba arrived as royalty, with a large entourage and **camels loaded** with precious commodities. This was a high-level meeting, as demonstrated by Solomon’s generous gifts to her (*10:13*).\n\n
10:3	idm41252					 The queen was satisfied with Solomon’s wisdom. He answered all of her questions well, and she was **overwhelmed** by the applied wisdom in his building activities, well-organized administration and staff, and commitment to his God. Jesus commended the queen’s search for truth while condemning the Pharisees and teachers of religious law who failed to recognize him—the one who was greater than Solomon (*Matt 12:42*).\n\n
10:6	idm41260					 The queen’s testimony confirmed her amazement. Not only was everything she had heard true, but now that she had seen it with her **own eyes,** she realized that Solomon’s accomplishments had been understated. She recognized that the Lord was Solomon’s benefactor and that Solomon should steward his God-given wisdom **with justice and righteousness.** \n\n
10:10	idm41268					 Solomon possessed and used abundant **gold** during his reign. What the **queen** provided supplemented what Solomon already possessed through his trading partnership with Hiram of Tyre. The precious metal was put to good use (see *6:20-22*, *28*, *30*, *32*, *35*; *7:49-51*; *10:18*, *21*). • Arabian traders dealt in **spices** such as frankincense and myrrh. Both were used for medicinal purposes; frankincense was also used in the sacred incense (*Exod 30:34-38*; *Lev 2:2*), and myrrh was used both for perfume and for embalming the dead. These spices and gold were presented to Jesus by wise men from eastern lands (*Matt 2:1-11*).\n\n
10:11	idm41288					 **Sandalwood** is a reddish-brown wood native to India and valued for its aromatic essential oil. Cuneiform tablets found at Ras Shamra and Alalakh also indicate its value for making fine furniture and musical instruments.\n\n
10:13	idm41295					 **whatever she asked for:** As befitting a royal host, **Solomon** reciprocated with **gifts**. The amicable relationship between Solomon and the **queen of Sheba** may have culminated in a commercial agreement. Subsequent Jewish, Arabian, and Ethiopian tales of a romantic relationship between them have no foundation in fact.\n\n
10:14	idm41305					 To further describe Solomon’s splendor, the writer builds upon the details of the queen’s visit (*10:1-13*), describing Solomon’s wise use of wealth in his palace complex (*10:14-21*) and concluding with the far-reaching effects of Solomon’s wisdom in commercial arrangements (*10:22-29*).\n\n
10:14	idm41314					 **about 25 tons:** The large amount of **gold** came from Solomon’s various enterprises and taxes; he also levied tolls upon **merchants and traders** who passed through his kingdom.\n\n
10:16	idm41323					 Although such shields were typically designed to accommodate infantry (**large shields**) or archers (**smaller shields**), these shields probably had ceremonial uses.\n\n
10:18	idm41331					 Solomon obtained **ivory** through commercial ventures with Hiram. Ancient Near Eastern kings often used **lion** figures as symbols of royal power and divine protection of the throne.\n\n
10:22	idm41339					 **fleet of trading ships of Tarshish:** The Hebrew term designates a type of merchant ship. • Phoenician sailors manned Solomon’s fleet, which put out to sea from Ezion-geber (*9:26-28*; see *Isa 23:1*). • **apes, and peacocks:** Archaeology provides ample evidence that kings imported such creatures. Apparently these animals were desired for their novelty and exotic nature and because they reflected conquest of distant lands.\n\n
10:26	idm41349					 **1,400 chariots:** Prior to Solomon, chariots were not a significant part of Israel’s army. In fact, *Deut 17:16* condemns kings for accumulating horses rather than relying on God. Although archaeological confirmation of the presence of chariots in Solomon’s day is debated, his **chariot cities** are commonly identified as Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer (*1 Kgs 9:15*, *19*). The Assyrian king Shalmaneser III reported facing a heavy contingent of enemy chariots at the Battle of Qarqar (853 BC), 2,000 of which were supplied by King Ahab of Israel.\n\n
10:28	idm41361					 In addition to his own accumulation, Solomon apparently served as a middleman, exchanging **horses** and **chariots** between the Egyptians to the south and the Syrians and Anatolians to the north.\n\n
11:1	idm41369					 In spite of his God-given wisdom, Solomon blatantly violated the law of Moses with his excessive wealth and many wives (see *Exod 34:12-17*; *Deut 7:3-4*; *17:17*). Taking wives to form foreign alliances compromised Solomon’s spiritual commitment, as predicted, and turned **his heart away from the** Lord. The spiritual and political consequences for his people were disastrous (see *1 Kgs 11:4-13*; *12:4*, *16*; *2 Kgs 17:5-23*; *25:1-23*).\n\n
11:4	idm41385					 **instead of being completely faithful:** Although **David** had committed grievous sin, he genuinely repented when rebuked by God’s prophet (*2 Sam 11:1–12:23*; *Ps 51:1-4*). However, **Solomon** failed to heed God’s warnings (*1 Kgs 3:14*; *6:12-13*; *9:4-9*) or to learn from Israel’s past; instead, he reproduced their sins.\n\n
11:5	idm41399					 **Ashtoreth**, the Canaanite goddess of love and war, was widely worshiped in the ancient Near East under names such as Ishtar and Astarte. The cult practices associated with Astarte were transmitted to the Greek world in the worship of the goddess Aphrodite. • Rites in the worship of **Molech,** the god of the Ammonites, included sacrificing children by fire (*11:7*; see *Lev 20:1-5*; *2 Kgs 16:3*; *23:5-10*; *Jer 7:30-33*; *19:4-6*; *32:35*), which the writer properly denounces as **detestable.** \n\n
11:7	idm41415					 The Moabite god **Chemosh** is mentioned on the Mesha Stela (Moabite Stone) detailing the Moabite-Israelite conflict (see *2 Kgs 3*).\n\n
11:9	idm41423					 **The** Lord** . . . had appeared to him twice** (*3:5-15*; *9:1-9*): On both occasions, God reminded **Solomon** of the need to be faithful. When the king failed to heed the Lord’s warning **about worshiping other gods**, he clearly violated the first commandment (*Exod 20:3*) and God’s covenants with both Moses and David.\n\n
11:11	idm41437					 God announced that **the kingdom** would be divided, although Solomon’s descendants would retain part of it (see *11:32-36*).\n\n
11:14	idm41445					 God delivered Solomon’s punishment through three political adversaries, **Hadad**, **Rezon**, and **Jeroboam** (see *11:40*).\n\n
11:14	idm41455					 Solomon’s first adversary was **Hadad.** David had fought against the Edomites and defeated them with a great slaughter (*2 Sam 8:13-14*; *1 Chr 18:13-14*). Hadad was the only member of the **Edomite** royal house to survive and escape. He had gone to **Egypt** with a number of followers, where the Egyptian king received him as a potential ally and **gave him his wife’s sister in marriage.** When **David and . . . Joab** died, Hadad returned to Edom, awaiting an opportunity to retaliate against Israel.\n\n
11:23	idm41468					 Solomon’s second adversary was **Rezon***,* an Aramean who had served under **King Hadadezer** of Aram-zobah. When **David** had defeated *Hadadezer* (*2 Sam 8:3-7*), Rezon escaped, gained a group of followers, and went **to Damascus.** He maintained himself there when Solomon campaigned in Hamath-zobah (*2 Chr 8:3-4*) and eventually **became king** of Damascus. Like Hadad, Rezon remained a bitter enemy of **Israel** and was troublesome to Solomon.\n\n
11:26	idm41484					 Information about Solomon’s third adversary, **Jeroboam son of Nebat**, provides background for the division of the kingdom of Israel (chs *12–14*).\n\n
11:27	idm41492					 **Solomon** noted the work ethic of **Jeroboam** during the repair of the city’s structures and **put him in charge**. Jeroboam’s status among the laborers may have made him aware of brewing discontent in northern sections of Solomon’s kingdom. Jeroboam showed leadership on this occasion, as well as during the empire’s division and reorganization of the northern tribes (*12:12-19*, *25-33*). Unfortunately, he did not always use his abilities wisely and later proved unfaithful to the Lord (*12:25–13:10*; *14:14-16*; *2 Kgs 17:21-23*).\n\n
11:29	idm41506					 The meeting between **Jeroboam** and **the prophet Ahijah** set in motion God’s judgment on the dynasty of Solomon. **Ahijah** reappears in the account of Jeroboam’s sick son (*14:1-18*). He authored an unpreserved work containing information about Solomon’s deeds (*2 Chr 9:29*).\n\n
11:29	idm41517					 Ahijah’s symbolic tearing of his cloak into **twelve pieces** and giving **ten of these pieces** to **Jeroboam** symbolized God’s plans for Jeroboam and Israel following Solomon’s death (see “*Prophetic Sign Acts*” Theme Note). **Ten of the tribes** would defect; **one tribe** (Judah) would remain with Solomon’s heir. The twelfth tribe was probably Benjamin (see *1 Kgs 12:21*). Benjamin consistently acted in tandem with Judah (see *2 Chr 11:3*, *23*; *14:8*; *15:2-9*; *17:17*). Simeon, the other southern tribe, seems to have allied with the north (*2 Chr 15:9*; *34:6*).\n\n
11:34	idm41537					 Ahijah further described the coming division of the kingdom and delivered God’s offer of blessing and perpetuity to Jeroboam, who was required to obey the Lord in order to receive the offer.\n\n
11:34	idm41543					 **For the sake of my servant David:** Although Solomon violated the terms of God’s covenant, God remained faithful in not revoking his promises to David (see also *Ps 89:28-37*).\n\n
11:36	idm41551					 **a lamp:** David’s successors were to be living representatives of God’s covenant with David, and they were to shine as lights of God’s grace (*15:4*; *2 Kgs 8:19*; *2 Chr 21:7*). They pointed to Jesus, the descendant of David, who is the light of the world (*John 1:4-5*) and who fulfills God’s promises to David (*Ezek 34:23-31*).\n\n
11:38	idm41563					 **an enduring dynasty:** Jeroboam had a great opportunity. God promised that if he was faithful and obedient to the Lord, his kingdom would be strong and long-lasting. However, he departed from God (*12:25-33*; *14:10-18*) and set Israel on a destructive spiritual path (*2 Kgs 17:21-23*).\n\n
11:39	idm41573					 David’s descendant, Jesus, would later inherit his rightful throne, as stipulated in God’s promises to David (*2 Sam 7:13*, *16-19*; *Ps 89:35-37*), Abraham (*Gen 17:1-8*; *Luke 1:67-79*), and Judah (*Gen 49:10*). He has established a new covenant with God’s people, and he will reign **forever** (*Jer 31:31-36*; *Ezek 37:22-28*; *2 Cor 3:6*).\n\n
11:40	idm41589					 **Solomon**, probably aware of impending difficulty, **tried to kill Jeroboam**. • **King Shishak of Egypt** later invaded Judah during the reign of Solomon’s son Rehoboam (*14:25-26*).\n\n
11:41	idm41599					 The brief closing summary of **Solomon’s reign** and death is similar to that of his father David (*2:10-12*). These summaries provide a typical formula for the accounts of succeeding kings. • **The Book of the Acts of Solomon** was likely kept in a prophetic center or in palace and Temple archives. It served as a source of information for the author of Kings but is now lost (cp. *14:19*, *29*). • **Solomon** reigned from 971 to 931 BC.\n\n
12:1	idm41612					 **Shechem***,* located in the heart of territory belonging to the northern tribes, had been a strategic site and religious center since the pre-Israelite occupation of Canaan (*Gen 12:6-7*; *33:18-20*), and it became important in Israel as a Levitical city and a city of refuge (*Josh 20:7*; *21:20*; *24:1*). **Rehoboam** knew that if he wanted to be **king** over a united kingdom, he would need the approval and support of the politically and religiously strong northern tribes. Shechem later became the provisional capital of the northern kingdom (*1 Kgs 12:25*). • Rehoboam reigned from 931 to 913 BC.\n\n
12:4	idm41629					 **harsh labor demands and heavy taxes:** See *4:7*, *22-23*; *5:13-18*; *9:20-23*; *11:27-28*.\n\n
12:5	idm41641					 **three days:** Rehoboam’s waiting period to consult his advisers is traditional; the third day was one of final decision (see *2 Kgs 20:4-8*). Jesus rose from the grave on the third day (*Luke 24:41*; *1 Cor 15:4*).\n\n
12:6	idm41651					 **older men:** Those who had served under Solomon advised moderation.\n\n
12:8	idm41658					 **young men:** Rehoboam’s appointed contemporaries took a hard line and advised the opposite of the older men.\n\n
12:11	idm41665					 **scorpions:** This was probably a type of whip that contained barbs or nails; the wounds inflicted by this weapon were like a scorpion’s sting.\n\n
12:12	idm41672					 Rehoboam’s decision to heed **the counsel of his younger advisers** was disastrous; it led the northern tribes to secede, followed by years of intermittent warfare (*14:30*; *15:7*, *32*). • **the will of the** Lord**:** God directed these human decisions to fulfill the prophesied judgment against Solomon (*11:11-13*, *29-39*).\n\n
12:18	idm41687					 **Adoniram** served under both David (*2 Sam 20:24*) and Solomon (*1 Kgs 4:6*; *5:13-14*). His **death** by stoning showed the folly of Rehoboam’s decision to send the unpopular supervisor of the labor force **to restore order** in the north.\n\n
12:21	idm41699					 Rehoboam resolved **to restore the kingdom to himself** by force, but he turned back when confronted with **the message of the** Lord through **Shemaiah.** The expression **man of God** emphasizes a prophet’s relationship to the Lord as his messenger. God’s prophets played a leading role in the history of the divided kingdom. Shemaiah apparently authored a history of Rehoboam’s reign (*2 Chr 12:15*).\n\n
12:25	idm41711					 Jeroboam’s actions in establishing his kingdom are reported in two sections, one on his building activities (*12:25*), the other on his false shrines and religious practices (*12:26-33*).\n\n
12:25	idm41719					 Both **Shechem** (*12:1*) and **Peniel,** which Jeroboam built across the Jordan River, were strategic defensive sites against the Arameans.\n\n
12:26	idm41728					 **Jeroboam** tried to satisfy Israel’s spiritual needs and maintain the allegiance of his people by making the worship services in the north both convenient and distinctive.\n\n
12:28	idm41735					 **Two gold calves** would strike a responsive chord regarding Israel’s history (*Exod 32*; esp. *32:4*). Similar religious practices, associated with the Canaanite god Baal-Hadad, also appealed to the remaining Canaanite population in the northern kingdom. Jeroboam’s intentions compromised true worship and caused religious confusion (see *1 Kgs 14:9*; *Hos 8:6*).\n\n
12:29	idm41746					 By placing the **calf idols in Bethel** (the southern part of Israel) and **in Dan** (the far northern section) Jeroboam gave his people two choice sites with long religious traditions (see *Gen 12:8*; *28:11-19*; *Judg 18:30-31*). Archaeological excavations confirm the existence of a high place—an altar for pagan worship—in Dan. Bethel was where Jacob had his dream (*Gen 28:10-22*), and it was the resting place of the Ark of the Covenant in the days of the judges (*Judg 20:18-28*) and a sanctuary in Samuel’s time (*1 Sam 7:16*; *10:3*).\n\n
12:31	idm41761					 Jeroboam directly violated the law of Moses, which prohibited worship at **pagan shrines** (*Deut 12:2-7*) and specified that priests were to come only from the **tribe of Levi** (*Exod 40:13-15*; *Num 1:50-53*).\n\n
12:32	idm41772					 Replacing the **Festival of Shelters,** Israel’s crowning ceremonial feast in the seventh month, with the **festival in Bethel** also violated the law (*Deut 16:13-15*). The **imitation** observance one month later during **the eighth month** may have coincided with the end of the Canaanite agricultural year. Jeroboam’s false religious practices led to Israel’s downfall (*2 Kgs 17:22*). • Jeroboam’s offering of **sacrifices on the altar at Bethel** set a bad precedent in spiritual leadership.\n\n
13:1	idm41785					 The account of the unnamed **man of God** who denounced Jeroboam’s false altar at Bethel emphasizes the authority of God’s word. Like Isaiah’s prophecy of Cyrus’s coming (*Isa 44:28*; *45:1*) and Micah’s prophecy about Bethlehem as the Messiah’s birthplace (*Mic 5:2*), this prophecy gave a distinctive proper name associated with an event long before it happened (*2 Kgs 23:15-20*). Such prophecies give assurance of God’s sovereignty and omniscience (see *Isa 42:9*).\n\n
13:3	idm41797					 In Levitical regulations, **ashes** from sacrifices at the prescribed altar were to be taken to a clean place (*Lev 1:16*; *6:10-11*). Because Jeroboam’s **altar . . . split apart, and its ashes . . . poured out**, the altar and its sacrifices were rendered unclean.\n\n
13:4	idm41807					 The paralysis of Jeroboam’s shoulder and arm and the fulfillment of the prophetic sign concerning the altar confirmed God’s omnipotence as well as his direct displeasure with Jeroboam’s apostate religion.\n\n
13:6	idm41813					 **hand was restored:** God showed mercy toward Jeroboam; his restored hand should have reminded Jeroboam that it was still possible to serve God properly.\n\n
13:7	idm41820					 **have something to eat:** In accordance with ancient Near Eastern custom, the king’s seeming gratitude and offer of hospitality also carried implications of approval and fellowship (*13:19*; see *Gen 24:52-54*).\n\n
13:11	idm41829					 Whatever the old prophet’s motives were for seeking out the **man of God,** he clearly lied about receiving God’s message through an angel. The man of God knew that what the **old prophet** asked was contrary to the Lord’s instructions (*13:8-10*, *16-17*; cp. *Gal 1:8*).\n\n
13:20	idm41840					 Although the old prophet had lied, God communicated through him. The severe pronouncement against the **man of God** was that because of his disobedience, he would be denied burial in his ancestral tomb. This death sentence was quickly carried out. Disobedience to the clear command of God is a serious offense (*Num 14:21-23*; *Deut 11:26-28*).\n\n
13:23	idm41849					 The **donkey** did not run away and the **lion** did not eat the man’s body, a supernatural event. The **old prophet** immediately understood that God had clearly **fulfilled his word** (*13:21-22*) by judging disobedience.\n\n
13:30	idm41860					 The old prophet probably had a modest **grave.** Such tombs were hewn out of soft limestone in a wadi (a stream bed) near the person’s home.\n\n
13:32	idm41867					 **the message . . . will certainly come true:** The Lord’s swift judgment convinced the old prophet that the oracle of judgment pronounced by the man of God against Jeroboam’s altar would be fulfilled. The prophecy came true years later during Josiah’s reforms (*2 Kgs 23:15-18*). • **Samaria** was established as the capital city of Israel during the reign of Omri, first king of Israel’s third dynasty (*1 Kgs 16:24*, *29-33*). The name *Samaria* sometimes refers to the capital city and sometimes to the northern kingdom in general (*2 Kgs 17:24*; *Amos 6:1*). Samaria’s mention here reflects the perspective of an author living at a later time. Similar uses of location names elsewhere reflect editorial updating (cp. *Gen 23:2* with *Josh 14:15*; *Judg 1:10*).\n\n
13:33	idm41884					 Apparently, **Jeroboam** knew what had happened to the man of God, but it did nothing to change his spiritual outlook. Jeroboam’s persistently apostate religion, despite God’s denunciation of it, doomed his **dynasty** to destruction (*14:7-11*, *15-16*; *15:27-30*). As succeeding Israelite kings perpetuated his sin, it brought about the complete demise of the northern kingdom (*2 Kgs 17:20-23*).\n\n
14:2	idm41896					 **Disguise yourself:** Jeroboam apparently recognized that his sin had separated him from any right to approach God’s prophet. He knew that the man who had predicted his accession to Israel’s throne could predict the child’s fate and perhaps intercede with the Lord on his behalf. • **Shiloh** had earlier been destroyed by the Philistines in the time of Eli (*1 Sam 4*). Before that, the Tabernacle resided there (*Josh 18:1*; *1 Sam 1:3*). A small community once again inhabited the site, which remained largely undeveloped throughout the divided monarchy.\n\n
14:3	idm41907					 It was customary to take a **gift** to a prophet when seeking his counsel (*2 Kgs 5:5*; *8:8*). King Jeroboam’s wife took everyday commodities to supplement her disguise.\n\n
14:5	idm41916					 **the answer I give you:** The Lord often instructed prophets to deliver only the message that he gave them (see *22:14*; *Num 22:38*; *23:12*; *Jer 7:2*; *Amos 7:14-15*).\n\n
14:7	idm41928					 God had blessed Jeroboam and established him as **ruler** in Israel (see *study note on 1:35*). However, Jeroboam abused God’s appointment with his false religion.\n\n
14:8	idm41936					 Unlike **David,** who genuinely repented of his sins (*2 Sam 12:13*; *Ps 51:2-4*), Jeroboam exceeded his predecessors in doing **evil.** Despite clear evidence of God’s displeasure and coming judgment (*1 Kgs 13:33*), he failed to turn from his ways. His sin would bring grave consequences to his family and descendants (*13:34*; *14:10-11*, *14*) and, ultimately, to the whole northern kingdom (*14:16*). • **gold calves:** see *12:26-30*.\n\n
14:11	idm41953					 **eaten by dogs:** This message of judgment for **Jeroboam’s family** followed the legal curses pronounced for unfaithfulness (*Deut 28:26*; see *1 Kgs 16:4*; *21:23*; *2 Kgs 9:35-37*).\n\n
14:14	idm41965					 **destroy the family of Jeroboam:** The prophecy quickly came true. God raised up Baasha, who killed Jeroboam’s son Nadab in the second year of Nadab’s reign (*15:27-28*).\n\n
14:15	idm41973					 **Asherah** was thought to be the consort of El, the elder god of ancient Canaan. Asherah **worship** included fertility rites at sacred trees or **poles;** it became a chronic sin for God’s people (*15:13*; *16:33*; *18:19*; *Deut 16:21*; *Judg 3:7*).\n\n
14:17	idm41987					 **Tirzah** was situated on the road from Shechem to Beth-shan. Noted for its great beauty (*Song 6:4*), the city was a royal retreat that apparently had become the capital of the northern kingdom (*1 Kgs 16:6*, *8*). • **The child died**, as Ahijah had predicted.\n\n
14:19	idm41998					 **all his wars:** Jeroboam engaged in repeated border skirmishes with Rehoboam (*14:30*). • **The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel** is mentioned seventeen times in *1 Kgs 14:19—2 Kgs 15:31*; it includes material that may have originated in official records kept by the court recorder (see *1 Kgs 4:3*). It was known to the original readers of 1–2 Kings but is now lost.\n\n
14:21	idm42009					 Between the opening and closing details about Rehoboam’s reign (*14:21*, *29-31*), the account focuses on the deteriorating spiritual experience of God’s people in Judah (*14:22-24*) and on an Egyptian invasion (*14:25-28*).\n\n
14:21	idm42019					 Rather than any city of the northern kingdom, **the city the** Lord** had chosen** was **Jerusalem**. • **Naamah,** as the queen **mother**, was highly esteemed in Judah. This role seems to have developed into an official status (*15:13*), and Judah’s queen mothers are often mentioned in connection with the reigning king (see, e.g., *Jer 22:26*).\n\n
14:22	idm42033					 **the people of Judah did what was evil:** Although Rehoboam seemed to begin his reign in good spiritual form (*2 Chr 11:5-17*, *23*), he deserted God’s standards (*2 Chr 12:1*).\n\n
14:23	idm42043					 Solomon had married foreign wives, who led his family into idolatry. Judah, under Rehoboam’s leadership, then perpetuated the **detestable practices of the pagan nations** that occupied the land before the Israelites. The spiritual decline of a nation easily follows from debased leadership, which leads to disgrace and destruction (*Prov 14:34*). • **Shrine prostitutes** were not uncommon in Canaan but were prohibited for Israel (see study notes on *Lev 17:7*; *Deut 23:17-18*). They became a part of Israelite society as the people embraced Canaanite culture.\n\n
14:25	idm42054					 **Shishak** (Shoshenq I, 945–924 BC), of Egypt’s 22nd dynasty, reunited the land of Egypt that was divided during the 21st dynasty. He gave Egypt renewed stability, economic expansion, and military power. His attack on Judah is also recorded by the Chronicler (*2 Chr 12:2-4*) and is written on the Amon Temple in Thebes.\n\n
14:26	idm42065					 When Rehoboam replaced Solomon’s **gold shields** with **bronze shields,** it reflected the declining spiritual value of Rehoboam’s kingdom. The complete destruction of Judah and Jerusalem was avoided only when Rehoboam repented in response to the Lord’s word through the prophet Shemaiah (*2 Chr 12:5-6*, *12*).\n\n
14:29	idm42075					 The closing report concerning **Rehoboam’s reign** notes his constant strife with **Jeroboam.**\n\n
15:1	idm42083					 The author of 1 & 2 Kings describes the reign of each king of Judah in a typical pattern: the date of his accession in chronological relationship to the current king of the other kingdom (*15:1*), the length of his reign, the name of his mother (*15:2*), a spiritual evaluation of his character (*15:3-5*), details of his reign (*15:6-7*), sources where further data about him could be found (*15:7*), where he was buried, and his successor’s name (*15:8*).\n\n
15:1	idm42095					 **Abijam** (see *study note on 2 Chr 13:1*) reigned from 913 to 910 BC.\n\n
15:2	idm42104					 Abijam’s **mother was Maacah**, Rehoboam’s favorite of his eighteen wives. She was the **granddaughter of Absalom.** Presumably this Absalom is David’s son. Maacah, an idol worshiper, was an evil spiritual influence in Judah (*15:13*).\n\n
15:3	idm42113					 Despite Abijam’s unfaithfulness, **God** remained **faithful** to his covenant with David (*2 Sam 7:12-16*; *Ps 89:19-29*) and preserved David’s line on Judah’s throne. Each king that followed David was to be **a lamp,** dispensing the light of God’s grace (*1 Kgs 11:36*).\n\n
15:6	idm42125					 **Abijam** inherited the hostility between the northern and southern kingdoms. Like Rehoboam (*14:30*), he faced **war** with **Jeroboam**. During one notable battle (*2 Chr 13:2-20*), when Abijam and his outnumbered forces were surrounded by northern troops, they cried out to the Lord; God delivered them and enabled them to inflict a severe defeat on Jeroboam.\n\n
15:7	idm42136					 **rest of the events:** Among other details of **Abijam’s reign,** the Chronicler tells us that he married fourteen wives and had thirty-eight children (*2 Chr 13:21*).\n\n
15:9	idm42145					 **Asa** reigned from 910 to 869 BC.\n\n
15:10	idm42153					 **forty-one years:** The first ten years of Asa’s long reign were peaceful (*2 Chr 14:1-7*), perhaps due to his father’s decisive victory over Jeroboam.\n\n
15:11	idm42161					 **did what was pleasing:** In addition to reforms mentioned here, the Chronicler records the positive spiritual influence of God’s prophet Azariah upon the king (*2 Chr 15:1-7*) and Asa’s convening of a great assembly to renew the covenant with the Lord (*2 Chr 15:9-15*). • **shrine prostitutes:** See *1 Kgs 14:23-24*. Asa’s efforts to restrict idolatry and pagan fertility rites even extended to **Maacah,** deposing her from her influential role as **queen mother** (*15:13*; *2 Chr 15:16*). • The **Kidron Valley** became a place for reforming kings of Judah to destroy pagan idols (*2 Kgs 23:4-15*; *2 Chr 29:16*; *30:14*).\n\n
15:14	idm42180					 Although he allowed the **pagan shrines** to remain, **Asa’s heart remained . . . faithful to the** Lord. The pagan shrines apparently became locations for worshiping the Lord. In his latter days, Asa’s spiritual ardor appears to have diminished (*2 Chr 16:7-12*).\n\n
15:16	idm42190					 **Baasha** began to reign in Asa’s third year (*15:33*); when Baasha was established, Judah faced renewed hostilities with Israel. **Asa** also withstood an attack by Zerah the Ethiopian (*2 Chr 14:9-12*), who was apparently a commander in the service of Pharaoh Osorkon I (924–889 BC). Asa and his troops won a great victory and took vast plunder from Zerah’s forces and from towns in the Negev that probably launched the Egyptian invasion.\n\n
15:17	idm42201					 Baasha’s southward thrust recaptured towns previously lost to Abijam (*2 Chr 13:19*), as well as **Ramah** in Judah**,** about four miles north of Jerusalem. This sealed the border, preventing the Israelites from defecting to **Judah** and confining Asa to his own territory. Ramah commanded the important north–south and east–west routes in Canaan (*Judg 4:5*; *Isa 10:29*; *Jer 31:15*; *40:1*).\n\n
15:18	idm42215					 **Ben-hadad . . . the king of Aram** and his successors were a major factor in Aramean-Israelite relations for many years. Asa’s appeal for Ben-hadad’s help was reinforced with rich gifts taken from the Temple treasury. Despite previous enmity between the Arameans and Israel (*11:23-25*; *2 Sam 8:3-12*; *2 Chr 8:3-4*), Ben-hadad and **Baasha** had established a treaty.** Asa** understood that the Aramean king’s assistance could be purchased for the right price (*1 Kgs 15:20*). When God’s prophet Hanani delivered the Lord’s rebuke to Asa for approaching Ben-hadad, Asa reacted uncharacteristically and threw him into prison (*2 Chr 16:7-10*). Asa apparently forgot God’s previous intervention on his behalf against Zerah’s sizeable army (*2 Chr 14:7-8*).\n\n
15:20	idm42230					 As a result of **King Asa’s request***,* the war with Baasha quickly turned to Asa’s advantage. **Ben-hadad** swiftly captured several sections of northern Israel and secured important northern trade routes, forcing **Baasha** to cease operations in **Ramah** in order to meet the emergency on his northern frontier. Asa retook Ramah and used its building materials to fortify other strategic border towns against further moves by Baasha.\n\n
15:23	idm42241					 **feet became diseased:** The nature of **Asa’s** malady is uncertain; the Talmud conjectures that it was gout. During his severe illness, Asa depended only on his physicians rather than seeking the Lord’s help (*2 Chr 16:12*).\n\n
15:25	idm42250					 The writer of 1 Kings presents Nadab’s biography following the standard format (see *study note on 15:1-8*).\n\n
15:27	idm42257					 **Baasha . . . assassinated . . . Nadab** and **slaughtered all the descendants of . . . Jeroboam**, thus terminating Israel’s first dynasty. Baasha’s father was named **Ahijah**, who is not to be confused with the prophet who predicted the demise of Jeroboam’s dynasty (*11:29-39*). Baasha’s coup d’etat was the first of several in Israel’s history (e.g., *16:9-10*).\n\n
15:30	idm42268					 **Jeroboam had provoked** the Lord’s condemnation and judgment. His sins were perpetuated by his son Nadab, and Baasha’s accession inaugurated a new dynasty that further weakened Israel’s spiritual condition (*15:34*).\n\n
15:32	idm42276					 **Baasha** established his capital at **Tirzah,** the royal retreat of earlier kings (*14:17*).\n\n
16:1	idm42285					 Like his father **Hanani,** whom Asa had imprisoned (*2 Chr 16:10*), **Jehu** was a prophet. Also like his father, Jehu would fearlessly deliver the Lord’s message anywhere, even if it meant confronting the king.\n\n
16:2	idm42294					 The Lord charged Baasha with being a murderer (*16:7*) and with following Jeroboam’s idolatry. Because he perpetuated Jeroboam’s **evil example***,* Baasha and his family would suffer the same consequences (see *14:11*).\n\n
16:5	idm42304					 The ministry of Jehu the prophet apparently covered both Israel and Judah, for he also wrote a history of events in Jehoshaphat’s reign that was included in **The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel** (cp. *2 Chr 20:34*).\n\n
16:9	idm42312					 Elah’s drunkenness in **Tirzah** while his army risked their lives at the Philistine-controlled city of Gibbethon (*16:15*) displayed his debased character; he was even less fit to reign than his father, Baasha (see *16:13*).\n\n
16:11	idm42321					 Zimri’s execution of all the **family . . . relatives and friends . . . of Baasha** was swift and merciless. While **Zimri** carried out the Lord’s sentence against the **dynasty of Baasha,** he doubtless did so for selfish reasons: to keep them from taking revenge on him or using their power or influence to organize their own coup.\n\n
16:15	idm42330					 Although **Zimri** commanded half of the royal chariots (*16:9*), he was in **Tirzah** rather than with the **army . . . attacking . . . Gibbethon.** He apparently did not have the respect of the armed forces; they saw his acts as **treason** and **chose** their commander **Omri** as **the new king of Israel.**\n\n
16:18	idm42344					 **burned it down over himself:** Zimri’s cowardice is evident in his suicide in the face of capture.\n\n
16:21	idm42351					 **Tibni** is mentioned only here, and **Ginath** is unknown. According to the Greek Old Testament, Tibni received help in his failed bid for power from his brother Joram, and both were **killed** in the confrontation with **Omri**.\n\n
16:23	idm42361					 **Omri . . . reigned twelve years in all:** Omri’s son Ahab succeeded him in the seventh year of his reign (cp. *16:29*), so Omri’s twelve-year rule likely includes about four years of co-regency with Ahab.\n\n
16:24	idm42369					 **Omri** founded the city of **Samaria** and relocated the capital there from Tirzah. Samaria was the capital of Israel until its fall in 722 BC. This site provided Israel with a centrally located and militarily defensible **hill** in the northern kingdom, and allowed oversight of the trade routes below. Omri enjoyed his new capital for only six years before his death (*16:28*).\n\n
16:25	idm42380					 **evil:** As in the transition from the first to the second dynasties (*15:33-34*), the new dynastic change did not improve Israel’s spiritual climate.\n\n
16:27	idm42388					 **the extent of his power:** Although mentioned only briefly in the Old Testament, **Omri** was well known to his contemporaries in surrounding lands. According to the Moabite Stone (Mesha Stela), Omri conquered the territory north of the Arnon River in Moab. Assyrian kings affirmed his importance by calling Israel the “House of Omri.” If, as was common in the ancient Near East, Omri arranged the marriage of his son Ahab to Jezebel (the daughter of Ethbaal, king of Tyre and Sidon, *16:31*), he may have enjoyed further political and commercial recognition.\n\n
16:31	idm42397					 The spiritual evaluation of **Ahab** is the worst yet among the kings of Israel. Later, Ahab’s evil behavior was attributed to his being “under the influence of his wife Jezebel” (*21:25*). Ahab and Jezebel propagated Canaanite worship rites, leading Israel further from the Lord. Added to Jeroboam’s false worship system, these sins eventually spelled disaster for Israel.\n\n
16:34	idm42405					 Despite Joshua’s curse against **Jericho** (*Josh 6:26-27*), the site was occasionally and temporarily occupied prior to being rebuilt by **Hiel** (see *Judg 3:13*; *2 Sam 10:5*; *1 Chr 19:5*), as archaeological excavations confirm. Hiel’s efforts signify the spiritual defection of Israel. • **When he laid its foundation . . . Segub:** The Targum (an interpretive Aramaic translation for Jews who did not know Hebrew after the Exile) suggests that Hiel sacrificed his sons as foundation offerings according to pagan practices; others understand the deaths to be from disease or accident. The sentence might be a Hebrew *merism* (using boundaries to indicate everything in between), which would imply that all of Hiel’s sons died.\n\n
17:1	idm42419					 The ministry of the prophet Elijah was intimately connected to his own spiritual journey. Elijah confronted Israel’s flirtation with the Canaanite storm-god, Baal. As the struggle ensued, Elijah learned of God’s power and provision in contrast to Baal’s impotence, as demonstrated during Elijah’s contest with the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel (*18:1-46*). Elijah’s subsequent flight from Jezebel led to God’s renewal of his prophetic commission at Mount Sinai (*19:1-18*). Elijah’s commission was completed by his successor, Elisha (*19:19-21*).\n\n
17:1	idm42428					 **Elijah** was God’s prophet to the northern kingdom during the reigns of the third-dynasty kings **Ahab** (874–853 BC) and Ahaziah (853–852 BC) and into that of Joram (852–841 BC). • Elijah showed his commitment to **the** Lord by declaring that he served the living **God of Israel.** • Elijah withheld the **dew** and **rain** as a direct affront to Baal, who supposedly controlled these natural forces. Their absence until God led Elijah to **give the word** initiated the contest with Baal that would reach a climax on Mount Carmel (ch *18*).\n\n
17:2	idm42446					 **Kerith Brook** provided a haven for **Elijah** during the divinely instituted drought (see *18:10*). The supply of food and water assured Elijah of God’s protection. • When Elijah’s source of water **dried up,** a change of location was necessary.\n\n
17:9	idm42456					 Elijah’s faith was tested further. At Kerith Brook, God had supplied his needs directly. With these supplies cut off, Elijah now had to depend on a foreign woman’s response to a divine test. The account details the setting (*17:8-10a*), Elijah’s test for the widow (*17:10b-14*), the woman’s compliance, and God’s reward (*17:15-16*).\n\n
17:9	idm42465					 **Zarephath** was in Phoenician territory about seven miles south of **Sidon,** away from Ahab’s jurisdiction. Ironically, God provided Elijah a place of refuge in Jezebel’s homeland, which was associated with worship of Baal. • **So he went:** Elijah again (see *17:5*) obeyed the Lord’s command. Obedience (*1 Sam 15:22*; *Ps 40:1-6*; *Isa 1:10-20*), trust (*Ps 37:3*; *Prov 3:5-6*), and faithfulness (*Ps 18:25*; *Rev 2:10*) are foundational attributes for successful spiritual service. • God’s ongoing provision for Elijah and the **widow** of Zarephath demonstrated God’s concern for all people who put him first. • **water . . . bread:** Elijah asked for the basic staples of life, but these were in scarce supply as the drought spread into Phoenician territory.\n\n
17:12	idm42484					 **by the** Lord** your God** (literally *as surely as the* Lord* your God lives*): The wording reflects Elijah’s oath and pronouncement to Ahab (*17:1*). The Gentile woman’s oath does not necessarily claim that the Lord is her god, but it does affirm to Elijah that what she says is the truth.\n\n
17:13	idm42497					 Despite the woman’s dwindling supplies (*17:12*), **Elijah** asked her to serve him before herself and her son. Like the poor widow who gave two small coins (*Luke 21:1-4*), this woman was asked to give all that she had to the Lord’s prophet. True faithfulness means placing God’s Kingdom ahead of personal concerns (*Matt 6:33*).\n\n
17:15	idm42507					 **She did as Elijah said**, and God rewarded her act of faith. The fresh supply of the widow’s daily necessities reminded her of God’s faithfulness and goodness (*Lam 3:22-24*; *Phil 4:19*).\n\n
17:17	idm42516					 This narrative begins with the woman’s doubts about Elijah (*17:17-18*) and ends with her acknowledging the authority of God’s word as spoken by Elijah (*17:24*). Ironically, this Gentile widow affirmed God’s miraculous power when God’s own people, Israel, had forgotten his mighty works.\n\n
17:17	idm42524					 **he died:** All attempts to explain away the subsequent miracle fly in the face of the plain statement.\n\n
17:18	idm42531					 **my sins:** The widow held to the common idea that suffering and misfortune are always the result of personal sin (see *Job 4:7*; *Luke 13:1-4*; *John 9:1-3*).\n\n
17:19	idm42541					 Following ancient Near Eastern custom, Elijah’s quarters were probably situated in a separate **room** accessed by an outside stairway. This arrangement maintained the woman’s reputation and offered Elijah a measure of privacy.\n\n
17:20	idm42548					 **why have you brought tragedy:** Elijah plaintively expressed to God the fear that his presence caused the child’s death.\n\n
17:21	idm42555					 While it is unclear what life-giving power Elijah was trying to convey by his physical contact with the deceased boy, it is clear that his confidence was in the Lord. Elisha later performed a similar physical ritual when the Lord restored the dead son of the woman from Shunem (*2 Kgs 4:32-37*).\n\n
17:22	idm42562					 The miracle of the child’s raising rewarded the faith of **Elijah** and confirmed the mother’s initial confidence in God’s prophet. Her testimony may indicate that she put her faith in **the** Lord. Jesus cited her as an example of God’s concern for non-Israelites and as an indication that God’s messengers are often more easily received by others than by their own countrymen (*Luke 4:24-26*). The Scriptures repeatedly mention God’s care of widows as illustrating his care for needy people (*Exod 22:21*; *Deut 10:18*; *27:19*; *Ps 68:5*; *Isa 1:17*; *Jas 1:27*).\n\n
18:2	idm42578					 **Elijah** continued to obey the Lord’s commands (see *17:5*, *10*), despite the personal danger of appearing **before Ahab.**\n\n
18:3	idm42588					 Due to the severity of the continuing drought, **Ahab** and **Obadiah***,* his chief officer (cp. *4:6*; *16:9*), set out to locate sufficient water and grass for the king’s horses. These provisions were crucial for military preparedness. Assyrian king Shalmaneser III wrote that Ahab put some 2,000 horse-drawn chariots into the Battle of Qarqar (853 BC). Solomon had also had many horses and chariots (*10:26*).\n\n
18:4	idm42601					 Obadiah’s care for **100** of **the** Lord**’s prophets** may indicate a group of prophets such as had existed since Samuel’s time (*1 Sam 10:5-18*; *19:20*, *24*). Such groups met together for study and mutual spiritual encouragement and are mentioned several times (*2 Kgs 4:1*, *38*; *9:1*). Elijah and Elisha apparently exercised leadership in some of these groups (*2 Kgs 2:3-7*, *15*; *6:1-7*).\n\n
18:10	idm42620					 **every nation and kingdom:** Ancient Near Eastern protocol called for the extradition of fugitives or runaway slaves, as noted in the famous treaty between Pharaoh Ramses II and the Hittite king Hattusilis (see ANET 200b, 203a). But Elijah had not had to seek asylum with a foreign king. God provided for his safety at Kerith Brook (*17:3*) and with the widow at Zarephath (*17:9*).\n\n
18:12	idm42629					 As a true believer, Obadiah recognized that **the Spirit of the** Lord operated within God’s prophets (*Judg 6:34*; *Ezek 3:12*, *14*; *11:1*). Obadiah feared that the Lord’s Spirit would **carry** Elijah **away** while he was reporting Elijah’s whereabouts to **Ahab**. The king would then interpret his inability to produce Elijah as a sign that he was hiding Elijah, and he would **kill** him.\n\n
18:16	idm42645					 **troublemakers:** Although Elijah announced the onset of the drought (*17:1*), it was **Ahab** and his **family** who brought God’s judgment upon Israel by their violations of the covenant and their sponsorship of Baal worship (see *Lev 26:19*; *Deut 28:15*, *23*; *2 Chr 7:13*; *Jer 14:1-7*; *Amos 4:7-8*).\n\n
18:19	idm42661					 **Mount Carmel** lies on a ridge dividing the coastal plain of Palestine. The site was known for Canaanite idol worship; an altar to the Lord had also been built there earlier (*18:30*). It was a natural location for the contest with **Baal.** Although the Septuagint (a Greek translation of the Old Testament) may indicate that the prophets of **Asherah** attended the ensuing contest on *Mount Carmel*, the Hebrew text does not (cp. *18:22*).\n\n
18:21	idm42673					 The Hebrew word translated **waver** means “to be lame” or “to limp.” **Elijah** compared the people’s **hobbling** between the worship of **the** Lord and of **Baal** to a person who limps awkwardly from one foot to the other. Elijah may have also been referring to the ritual dance performed by Baal’s prophets as they attempted to gain the storm-god’s attention (*18:26*).\n\n
18:22	idm42686					 **the only prophet of the** Lord**:** Obadiah had previously hidden two groups of fifty prophets to protect them from Jezebel’s purge (*18:4*, *13*). However, Elijah’s public stature must have left him feeling alone in his struggle against false religion (see *19:10*, *14*); certainly, he did stand alone in confronting the 450 prophets of Baal.\n\n
18:23	idm42699					 The Lord’s presence was attested by **fire** (*Exod 9:23*; *19:18*; *40:38*; *Deut 4:24*; *2 Chr 7:1*; *Isa 66:15*; *Amos 7:4*), which could have been lightning (cp. *Ps 18:12-13*; *Ezek 1:13-14*; *Zech 9:14*). The contest would demonstrate whether the Canaanite storm-god Baal or the God of Israel was the **true God***;* only the true God could **set fire** to the **wood** (cp. *Lev 9:24*).\n\n
18:27	idm42721					 **is relieving himself:** Elijah’s sarcastic taunts mocked the personification of the gods as having human needs. Egyptian priests awakened their god, then fed, washed, and dressed the idol in fresh clothing. They even put rouge on the idol’s face and placed the proper emblem of royalty on it.\n\n
18:28	idm42728					 **shouted . . . cut themselves . . . raved:** The prophets of Baal demonstrated ecstatic behavior common in ancient pagan religions, but their efforts produced **no response.** Of course, there is only one true God (*Deut 4:35*; *6:4*; *Isa 44:8*); all other hopes are doomed to failure (*Isa 45:22*).\n\n
18:31	idm42740					 The **twelve stones** that Elijah used **to rebuild the altar in the name of the** Lord should have reminded the people that God had a prior claim as the redeemer of all Israel (cp. *Josh 4:1-11*; see *Isa 41:14*; *49:26*).\n\n
18:33	idm42752					 Elijah avoided any hint of deception by dousing the **offering and the wood** with great quantities of water, perhaps taken from the nearby Mediterranean Sea or Kishon River.\n\n
18:36	idm42759					 At the appointed time of **sacrifice** to the Lord, Elijah prayed. He did not imitate the ecstatic behavior of the prophets of Baal but simply prayed to God in light of his promises to **Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob** (*Gen 50:24*; *Exod 3:6*, *15*; *4:5*; *Num 32:11*; *Deut 9:27*).\n\n
18:37	idm42773					 The call-**answer** motif appears frequently in the Old Testament, often depicting the petitioner’s intimate relationship to the Lord (*Job 14:15*; *Pss 4:1*; *91:15*; *102:2*; *Isa 65:24*; *Jer 33:3*).\n\n
18:38	idm42786					 Whether by lightning strike or more supernatural means, the Lord sent **fire** to consume everything, including **all the water in the trench.** This was convincing proof that **the** Lord** is God.** The continuing story demonstrates conclusively that the Lord, not Baal, has control over fire, water, and the weather.\n\n
18:41	idm42797					 **The servant . . . saw a little cloud** on the horizon that appeared to be the size of a hand. Yet it heralded the approach of **a terrific rainstorm**.\n\n
18:46	idm42805					 **He tucked his cloak into his belt** so he could run more easily **ahead of Ahab’s chariot.** The Hebrew idiom refers to doing anything vigorously or enthusiastically (*2 Kgs 4:29*). • **Jezreel** was between Megiddo and Beth-shan in the southeastern portion of the valley of Jezreel, about seventeen miles from Mount Carmel.\n\n
19:2	idm42815					 Speaking a curse, **Jezebel** reinforced her threat to kill **Elijah** within a day. Solomon had made a similar declaration regarding his half-brother Adonijah (*2:23*), and the king of Aram later issued an edict against Elisha with the same formula (*2 Kgs 6:31*). Jezebel acted with cold-blooded resolve to accomplish her purposes (*1 Kgs 21:5-15*).\n\n
19:3	idm42826					 **Elijah was afraid:** The NLT follows the Greek Old Testament and a majority of scholars in translating Elijah’s reaction as one of fear, proposing a reading of *wayyira’* (“he feared”) in the original Hebrew. The Hebrew text as we have it reads, “he saw it” (*wayyare’*)—i.e., the danger in Jezebel’s threat. Rather than a warm reception after the spectacular victory, and a hoped-for repentance beginning with the royal house, Elijah faced a death threat. • **Beersheba** lay at the southern end of the country. A familiar formula described the limits of the land as “from Dan . . . to Beersheba” (*4:25*; *2 Sam 24:2*).\n\n
19:4	idm42838					 Though technically a shrub, the **broom tree** can reach a height of ten feet. Its leaves are small, but it provides adequate shade for a weary traveler in **the wilderness.** Like Jonah (*Jon 4:3*), Elijah had successfully carried out his commission, but he felt a sense of defeat with the results. • **no better:** God’s refugee prophet felt that he had accomplished little and would be better off dead.\n\n
19:5	idm42848					 **The angel of the** Lord provided Elijah with precisely what he needed at the moment (*17:2-6*, *10-12*). God often sent an angel to minister to one of his servants (*Ps 34:7*; *Heb 1:14*).\n\n
19:8	idm42860					 Elijah’s determination to go to **Mount Sinai** took him on a journey of approximately 200 miles. The trip would not have required **forty days and forty nights**, so Elijah may have set a pace that was symbolic of Israel’s past. Moses spent forty days on Mount Sinai, and Israel subsequently wandered in the wilderness for forty years (*Num 14:33-34*; *Deut 1:2-3*). Forty sometimes represented a period of full testing (*Gen 7:4*; *Ps 95:10*; *Jon 3:4*; *Matt 4:1-2*).\n\n
19:9	idm42874					 **a cave** (literally *the cave*): Some have suggested that Elijah came to the very place where God appeared to Moses (*Exod 33:21-23*). • **What are you doing here, Elijah?** The Lord’s question may have a double implication: Why had Elijah come, and did he understand the significance of the spot where he stood? Elijah replied to the former part of the question. Elijah had boldly announced that he was alone in his stand for the Lord (*1 Kgs 18:22*); now, that feeling turned to self-pity.\n\n
19:11	idm42885					 The powerful physical phenomena that sometimes signal God’s presence (*Exod 3:2*; *19:18*; *Pss 68:7-8*; *114:4*; *Heb 3:6-7*) did not herald God’s approach on this occasion. Instead, Elijah sensed God’s presence when he heard **the sound of a gentle whisper.**\n\n
19:13	idm42897					 **What are you doing here?** The Lord repeats his question (see *19:9*), and Elijah gives exactly the same response as earlier. Elijah’s answer gives no indication that he understood how God was working through all that had happened. Paul makes reference to this interchange in *Rom 11:3-4*.\n\n
19:15	idm42906					 **Go back . . . and travel:** In loving patience, God renewed his prophet’s commission (cp. *John 21:15-19*). God directed Elijah to retrace his steps back to the place where he had strayed from God’s mission; from there he could move forward. • **Hazael** and **Jehu** both became instruments of God’s judgment (*2 Kgs 8:7-15*; *9:14-37*). • **Elisha**, Elijah’s successor, would bring spiritual discernment and the Lord’s further judgment to Israel (*2 Kgs 3:10-19*; *8:7-15*; *9:1–10:31*; *13:3*, *15-19*). • **Abel-meholah** was located south of Beth-shan, where the valley of Jezreel and the Jordan Valley come together (see *1 Kgs 4:12*; *Judg 7:22*).\n\n
19:18	idm42927					 The Lord corrected Elijah’s thinking; the prophet was not alone. Earlier he had forgotten the 100 prophets protected by Obadiah (*18:4*, *13*). Now he learned that there were **7,000 others** who remained faithful to the Lord. • **bowed down . . . or kissed him:** These common forms of submission in the ancient Near East (*2 Kgs 21:3*; *Isa 46:6*; *60:14*; *Hos 13:2*) are often mentioned in the annals of victorious kings or in the ancient epics. Ashurbanipal reported that on his sixth campaign, an Elamite king kissed his royal feet and tidied up the ground with his beard. In the Mesopotamian creation epic (*Enuma Elish,* V 86), even the great gods bowed down and kissed the feet of Marduk, the victorious head of the pantheon.\n\n
19:19	idm42942					 The anointing of **Elisha** is an epilogue to the Lord’s charge to **Elijah.** The two other anointings that God assigned to Elijah (*19:15-16*) were carried out by Elisha instead (*2 Kgs 8:7-15*; *9:1-10*).\n\n
19:19	idm42953					 **Twelve teams of oxen** would indicate that **Elisha** came from a wealthy family. • Elisha understood that Elijah’s power from God would come upon him with the prophet’s **cloak.**\n\n
19:21	idm42962					 Elisha burned his **plow** and **slaughtered** his **oxen** to signal a complete break from the past in his present calling. From now on, he would serve the Lord. His meal with family and friends may have been a thanksgiving sacrifice to God capped by a communal meal in joyful celebration of God’s claim upon Elisha’s life. • **Elisha** would first serve as Elijah’s **assistant.** Great leaders often begin as good learners. Joshua was Moses’ assistant (*Exod 24:13*) before becoming his successor (*Num 27:18-23*; *Deut 34:9*) and assuming command of the forces of Israel (*Josh 1:1-9*). Later, Elisha had an assistant named Gehazi (*2 Kgs 4:12*).\n\n
20:1	idm42978					 Whether this is **Ben-hadad** I or II is unclear. • **thirty-two allied kings:** Confederations of kings were common in the ancient Near East. Shalmaneser III recorded Ben-hadad’s name as *Hadad-ezer* and reported that he was part of a twelve-king coalition that opposed him in the Battle of Qarqar (853 BC).\n\n
20:2	idm42988					 Ben-hadad’s first delegation of **messengers** brought his demand that Israel must agree to surrender both its treasures and people. Ahab capitulated, wanting peace at any cost. He would give up royal treasures and even his family rather than face bloody war with a powerful enemy.\n\n
20:7	idm42995					 When Ben-hadad’s second delegation made even greater demands (see *1 Sam 11:1-2*), **Ahab** recognized that **Ben-hadad** seemed bent on war. Ahab repeated his compliance with Ben-hadad’s first **demand** but rejected the second. • **my lord the king:** Ahab addressed Ben-hadad in polite diplomatic terms, conceding his willingness to accept the Aramean king’s rule. Perhaps he hoped that his courteous reply would still avoid military confrontation.\n\n
20:10	idm43006					 Ben-hadad’s third delegation delivered an ultimatum: Surrender or die. His caustic threat to thoroughly plunder **Samaria** was reinforced with a curse, an example of the psychological warfare often practiced in the ancient Near East (see *2 Kgs 18:19-35*). • Ahab’s third reply to Ben-hadad contained proverbial wisdom. The outcome of the conflict was not yet sealed.\n\n
20:12	idm43014					 **Ben-hadad and the other kings . . . were drinking in their tents** in anticipation of **Ahab’s** capitulation. *Ahab’s* **reply** constituted a challenge, and the Aramean officers **prepared to attack.**\n\n
20:13	idm43025					 Two distinct battles ensued, one in Samaria (*20:13-25*) and one at Aphek (*20:26-34*). The writer included similar details regarding both: (1) pre-battle counsel (*20:13-14*, *23-25*), (2) pre-battle conditions (*20:15-16*, *26-28*), (3) victory for Israel despite the superior numbers of the enemy (*20:17-21*, *29-30*), and (4) post-battle counsel (*20:22*, *31*).\n\n
20:13	idm43041					 Ahab’s forces attacked **about noontime** after receiving assurance of victory from an unknown prophet. The Jewish historian Josephus suggested that the prophet was Micaiah (cp. *22:8*). The timing of the Israelite attack, during the heat of the day (see *Josh 8:14*), took the enemy by surprise. **Ben-hadad and the . . . allied kings** were still **drinking**, demonstrating their disdain for Ahab’s military capability.\n\n
20:17	idm43052					 **first contingent:** Ahab apparently sent this small squad to test the enemy. Surprise attacks in the ancient Near East often divided the attacking forces into assault groups designed to launch a pincer movement against the enemy (*Judg 7:16*; *1 Sam 11:11*), to lure the opposing forces into an ambush (*Josh 8:15-22*), or to draw the enemy to a spot where the attacking army enjoyed a superior position (*Judg 4:14-16*; *5:19-21*).\n\n
20:20	idm43064					 **Horses and chariots** were a key asset in ancient warfare. Ahab’s destruction of the major portion of Ben-hadad’s striking power was essential to guard against a future incursion. Still, God’s **prophet** warned that **the king of Aram** would return. • **next spring:** Late *spring* and early summer were standard seasons for warfare in the ancient Near East; the forces could count on good weather and a supply of grain from the early harvest.\n\n
20:23	idm43075					 The reasoning that Israel had **gods of the hills** set the stage for the Lord to show his true identity (*20:28*). **Ben-hadad’s officers** had a pagan religious outlook. Perhaps their erroneous view was fostered by traditional knowledge of the Lord’s appearance to Israel on Mount Sinai (*Exod 19:1-3*, *16-18*) or of Israel’s long-term settlement of the hill country of Canaan (see *Josh 10:40*; *11:16*; *Judg 1:19*). The Arameans were not aware that God is the Creator and Lord of all the earth (*Isa 40:28*; *54:5*), the only God who alone can save (*Isa 45:5*, *22*).\n\n
20:24	idm43093					 Ben-hadad’s **field commanders** reasoned that with trained military leadership and superiority in manpower and equipment, they would easily defeat Israel on the plains in the next encounter.\n\n
20:26	idm43100					 **Aphek** was east of the Sea of Galilee in northern Ramoth-gilead. Ben-hadad’s officers assumed that this location would favor the Aramean chariots and take away the power of Israel’s “gods of the hills.”\n\n
20:27	idm43107					 Despite the Arameans’ superior numbers, Israel won another outstanding victory by God’s help. All the parties learned that “nothing is impossible with God” (*Luke 1:37*; see *Matt 19:26*; *Mark 10:27*) and that when God is on one’s side, the enemy will retreat (*Ps 56:9*) with staggering losses (*Deut 32:30-31*; *2 Kgs 19:32-36*). Israel could face the foe fearlessly (*Pss 3:6*; *27:1-3*). • God’s assurance to Israel through the **man of God** showed that this battle was not just for Israel’s well-being but for the Lord’s glory.\n\n
20:31	idm43122					 **burlap . . . ropes:** Knowing the **merciful** mindset of the **kings of Israel**, **Ben-hadad’s officers** advised that they approach Ahab with symbols of humble repentance (*Joel 1:13*; *Jon 3:5-9*) and submission (*Job 12:18*; *Lam 1:14*). Ancient Near Eastern reliefs often depict captured enemies with ropes around their necks. Assyrian kings boasted of piercing their captives’ lips or cheeks with ropes.\n\n
20:32	idm43136					 **my brother:** Ahab spoke to **Ben-hadad** in terms that politely indicated the Aramean king’s royal authority and Ahab’s desire for good relations. Ahab welcomed Ben-hadad **into his chariot** to demonstrate his warm reception of the king, yet serving notice that he should recognize **Ahab** as his equal. Correspondence and parity agreements between kings of the ancient Near East used the language of brotherhood to express friendship, good relations, or formal equality.\n\n
20:34	idm43146					 The **treaty** that **Ahab** and **Ben-hadad** established provided parity between the parties, although it was especially favorable to Ahab as the victor. • **The towns** that Israel had lost to Aram (*15:20*) were restored and Ben-hadad made important **trade** concessions to Ahab, who may have reasoned that such an arrangement would be profitable and provide him with an ally against the rising power of Shalmaneser III of Assyria.\n\n
20:35	idm43158					 Ahab’s leniency toward Ben-hadad met with God’s disfavor, portrayed in the symbolic actions of an unidentified **prophet**. God’s prophets often conveyed the Lord’s message through symbolic actions (*Isa 20*; *Jer 27:1-7*; *Ezek 4:1-3*, *9-17*; *5:1-4*). Ahab had brought judgment upon himself and his people by sparing an untrustworthy enemy rather than trusting further in the Lord.\n\n
20:36	idm43170					 **a lion will kill you:** A lion was previously the means of divine judgment (*13:20-24*) and would be so again during the repopulation of Israel following the fall of Samaria (*2 Kgs 17:25-26*).\n\n
20:42	idm43179					 **The** Lord had apparently told Ahab to put Ben-hadad to death (cp. *Josh 6:17-21*), but Ahab violated his charge, perhaps viewing the Aramean king as part of the spoils of war (cp. *1 Sam 15:1-23*). The **king of Israel** would regret his folly: He later faced Ben-hadad in another battle that would cost him his life (*1 Kgs 22:29-37*). Rather than learning from the prophet’s rebuke, Ahab went home **angry and sullen.**\n\n
20:42	idm43192					 **destroyed:** See “*Complete Destruction*” Theme Note.\n\n
21:1	idm43200					 The writer includes another incident in which king Ahab responded in an **angry and sullen** manner (*20:43*; *21:4*).\n\n
21:1	idm43209					 In addition to his palace in the capital city, **Ahab** had a second **palace** in **Jezreel**. Excavations at Jezreel have unearthed a sizeable palace there. • **Samaria**, which sometimes refers to the capital city, here indicates the whole northern kingdom.\n\n
21:2	idm43219					 Naboth refused Ahab’s generous offer to **buy** or **exchange** land for his vineyard. While he may have desired to sell, Naboth noted that the law said that inherited property should stay in the family or tribe that originally owned it (*Lev 25:23-28*; *Num 36:7-9*). Unlike the kings of the surrounding nations, who could seize whatever property they wished (*1 Sam 8:11-17*), Ahab was bound by Israel’s law.\n\n
21:4	idm43230					 **angry and sullen:** Ahab’s reaction was the same when he was rebuked by God’s prophet (*20:43*). A sullen attitude can easily arise in a stubborn, self-centered person (*21:16*, *20*, *25-26*; see *16:31-32*; *18:10*, *17*; *20:42-43*; *22:3*, *27-30*).\n\n
21:7	idm43247					 **I’ll get you Naboth’s vineyard!** With her ruthless disposition and actions, **Jezebel** displayed her cultural upbringing; Canaanite kings did as they pleased (*21:8-10*, *15*, *25*; see *19:1-2*; *2 Kgs 9:30-31*).\n\n
21:8	idm43260					 **Call the citizens together:** This kind of assembly would normally address sin that could bring divine judgment against the people (see *Deut 21:1-9*; *Josh 7:10-12*; *1 Sam 7:1-6*). Jezebel convened it to bring false charges against an innocent person.\n\n
21:10	idm43270					 **scoundrels** (literally *sons of Belial*): The Hebrew expression refers to totally evil reprobates (*Deut 13:13*; *Judg 19:22*; *1 Sam 10:27*; *Prov 6:12*). Later Jewish writings attributed the name Belial to Satan, a use reflected by Paul in the New Testament (*2 Cor 6:15*). • Legally, two witnesses were needed to establish a charge against a person (*Deut 19:15*; *Matt 18:16*). The twofold charge of Naboth’s blasphemy against God and against the king carried a penalty of death by stoning outside the city (*Deut 17:5-6*; *22:24*). Naboth was apparently put **to death** on his own land (see *2 Kgs 9:21-26*).\n\n
21:13	idm43289					 As with Achan (*Josh 7:24-26*), Naboth’s sons were killed at the same time (see *2 Kgs 9:26*), in this case to prevent the property from passing on to them. Because the charge carried the penalty of state execution (*Deut 13:10-11*; *17:5*) and because Naboth no longer had male heirs, Ahab exercised the royal prerogative of confiscating the property (see *1 Sam 8:14*).\n\n
21:17	idm43300					 **Elijah** delivered the Lord’s sentence against **Ahab** just as he was about to take possession of the vineyard. Because Ahab was responsible for the death of **Naboth** and the seizing of his field, Ahab and his **family** would be destroyed. The prophecy concerning Ahab’s children would be fulfilled in Jehu’s purging of Baal worshipers from Israel (*2 Kgs 9:30-37*; *10:1-11*).\n\n
21:25	idm43312					 The author interrupts his account to reemphasize (see *16:30-34*) Ahab’s **evil** character, to denounce the king’s commitment to idolatry, and to condemn his weakness in allowing himself to be **under the influence of his wife Jezebel.** Wicked Jezebel would stop at nothing to achieve her own ends (*18:4*; *19:1-2*; *21:5-10*, *15*). Though arrogant and defiant to the end (*2 Kgs 9:30-31*), she eventually met her predicted doom (*1 Kgs 21:23*; *2 Kgs 9:32-37*).\n\n
21:27	idm43328					 Ahab was a complex character. Although justly condemned for his evil character, here he repented when the Lord’s prophet brought a **message** of rebuke (*21:27*). Because of Ahab’s repentance, **the** Lord sent **Elijah** to postpone the awful sentence against Ahab and instead impose it on his equally wicked sons (*2 Kgs 1:17*; *9:24-26*; *10:1-11*).\n\n
22:1	idm43342					 **three years . . . no war:** During this time, the repeated westward thrusts of the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III (858–824 BC) led to the Battle of Qarqar (853 BC). Shalmaneser’s records mention that he faced both Hadadezer (Ben-hadad) and Ahab at that battle. With the Assyrian king temporarily thwarted, old enmities between Aram and Israel flared up again.\n\n
22:2	idm43351					 **Jehoshaphat** and **Ahab** were in-laws by the marriage of Ahab’s daughter Athaliah to Jehoshaphat’s son Jehoram (*2 Kgs 8:25-26*). However cordial Jehoshaphat may have intended his **visit** to be, he quickly became involved in Ahab’s plan to occupy Ramoth-gilead. The Assyrian menace prevented Ahab from taking control of this key area that dominated the eastern end of the Plain of Jezreel. Now it needed to be taken by force, and Jehoshaphat placed his **troops** and **horses** at Ahab’s disposal.\n\n
22:5	idm43363					 In accordance with ancient Near Eastern custom, **Jehoshaphat** requested that the two kings determine the will of the Lord before going into battle. Examples of this custom are common in Aramean, Moabite, and Assyrian inscriptions as well as in the Old Testament (*1 Sam 23:2-4*; *2 Sam 5:19-25*). Despite Ahab’s misgivings, Jehoshaphat insisted on summoning Micaiah, a genuine **prophet of the** Lord.\n\n
22:10	idm43374					 In the ancient Near East, important business was often conducted **at the threshing floor** near the city **gate.** David secured the threshing floor of Araunah and built an altar there (*2 Sam 24:18-25*; *1 Chr 21:26*); it later became the site for the Temple in Jerusalem (*2 Chr 3:1*).\n\n
22:13	idm43385					 **The messenger who went to get Micaiah** warned that he had better **agree** with the false **prophets.** However, Micaiah promised only that he would faithfully deliver the Lord’s word (see *Num 22:38*; *24:13*).\n\n
22:15	idm43396					 The word **sarcastically** does not occur in the Hebrew text; the NLT simply makes explicit what Ahab sensed in Micaiah’s tone of voice (*18:27*; *Job 12:1-2*; *16:2*).\n\n
22:17	idm43406					 Like God himself (*Ps 23*; *Isa 40:10-11*), Israel’s kings and leaders were charged with care of the people much as a **shepherd** cares for his **sheep** (*Num 27:16-17*; *Ezek 34:2*, *11-16*). The motif of the shepherd and the sheep, applied to the coming Messiah (*Ezek 34:23-24*), was fulfilled in Christ the Good Shepherd (*John 10:1-11*). Although he laid down his life for the sheep (*John 10:14-18*; *1 Pet 2:24-25*), he still lives (*Heb 13:20*) and will come again for them (*1 Pet 5:4*).\n\n
22:19	idm43425					 Micaiah explained that God had allowed a **lying spirit** of prophecy to mislead Ahab to bring about his death. In his sovereignty, God used the counsel of Ahab’s false prophets to accomplish his will.\n\n
22:24	idm43432					 An indignant **Zedekiah**, one of the false prophets, insisted that he and the others were telling the truth. Like Ahab, they would one day find out the real truth when the prophecy against them was fulfilled in Jehu’s purge of Baal worship (*2 Kgs 10:18-28*).\n\n
22:29	idm43440					 Ahab hoped to avoid direct reprisal from Ben-hadad by wearing a **disguise.** By urging **Jehoshaphat** to **wear** his **royal robes,** Ahab hoped to escape detection and thwart Micaiah’s prophecy.\n\n
22:34	idm43450					 An Aramean soldier’s random **shot** fulfilled Micaiah’s prophecy about Ahab’s death. Ancient armor discovered during excavations in the Near East suggests that the arrow would have found a small unprotected area between the breastplate and the metal platelets that comprised the lower **armor.** Although he was **badly wounded,** Ahab displayed courage by remaining **propped up in his chariot** throughout the course of the day’s battle before calling for retreat.\n\n
22:37	idm43460					 Elijah’s prophecy that **dogs** would lick the **blood** of Ahab’s fallen body (*21:19*) was fulfilled.\n\n
22:39	idm43469					 Excavations at Samaria have disclosed Ahab’s **palace** and a nearby pool. The description of the palace as **ivory** may arise from the ivory-covered furnishings and wall panels. Gleaming white limestone covering the outside of the building also added to the palace’s ivory-like luster.\n\n
22:41	idm43477					 This overview provides basic information about Jehoshaphat’s twenty-five-year reign as king of Judah. The Chronicler provides more details on Jehoshaphat’s good spiritual character that led to religious reforms and the Lord’s blessing (*2 Chr 17:1–21:1*). Including a two-year co-regency with his father, Asa, **Jehoshaphat** reigned from 872 to 848 BC.\n\n
22:43	idm43486					 Although **Jehoshaphat** is remembered as a king who **did what was pleasing in the** Lord**’s sight**, his record is blemished by his failure to **remove all the pagan shrines** (see *15:14*) and by his involvement with Ahab (*22:4*, *29-32*; *2 Chr 19:1-3*) and, later, Joram (*2 Kgs 3:4-27*).\n\n
22:46	idm43502					 To Jehoshaphat’s credit, he eliminated religious **prostitutes,** who, although banned by **his father, Asa** (*15:12*), still existed. Religious prostitution was apparently centered at pagan shrines that his father had not removed (*15:14*).\n\n
22:47	idm43512					 The lack of a **king in Edom** may indicate Edom’s dependence upon Judah at this time.\n\n
22:48	idm43519					 Jehoshaphat built this **fleet of trading ships** in alliance with Ahaziah (see *2 Chr 20:35-37*). Like Solomon, the two kings planned to send a fleet to **Ophir** in search of **gold** (*1 Kgs 9:27-28*; *10:11*). The venture was ill-fated; to fulfill a prophetic warning (*2 Chr 20:37*), the Lord destroyed the fleet before it left port. **Jehoshaphat** wisely did not become entangled with **Ahaziah** a second time. • **Ezion-geber** was Solomon’s port city on the Gulf of Aqaba (*1 Kgs 9:26*).\n\n
22:51	idm43536					 The tragic story of the rule of **Ahaziah** in Israel continues in *2 Kgs 1:1-18*. He followed in the **evil** ways of his parents, Ahab and Jezebel (*1 Kgs 21:25-26*); he worshiped **Baal** (*2 Kgs 1:2*, *16*) and supported the state religion instituted by **Jeroboam** I (*1 Kgs 12:28-32*). Ahaziah’s accession and statement of character provide closure to the account of Ahab in 1 Kings and a smooth transition to the continuing story of the divided kingdom in 2 Kings.\n\n
