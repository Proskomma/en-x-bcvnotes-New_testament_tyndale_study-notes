1:1	idm60376					 *Psalms 1* and *8* form an *inclusio* (set of literary bookends) that describes what God expects of the ideal person (cp. *Pss 19*; *33*; *104*; *145*), contrasts the godly person with the wicked, and extols the godly person’s dignity. Jesus the Messiah (*Ps 2*)—the sovereign Lord (*Heb 2:6-8*; see *1 Cor 15:27*) and perfection of humanity—embodies this ideal.\n\n
1:1	idm60392					 The first two psalms are an introduction to the entire Psalter. *Psalm 1* introduces the Lord’s instruction in wisdom, while *Ps 2* introduces God’s rule over a rebellious, sinful world. Together, these psalms invite people to leave the way of folly that leads to destruction and to enter the way of God that leads to wisdom and salvation. The New Testament affirms that God will rule the nations through Jesus Christ, his appointed agent (*Heb 1:5*; *Rev 12:5*; *19:15*).\n\n
1:1	idm60403					 This wisdom psalm sets the tone for the whole Psalter. The psalmist strongly contrasts the happiness of the godly with the condemnation of the wicked; in the end, the way of wisdom will triumph. This idealization of the godly person (as in *Ps 8*) highlights the Lord’s expectations of his people and especially of the coming Messiah (*Ps 2*). The people of Israel did not live up to this ideal, and neither did the kings of David’s dynasty. Not even the best of them could bring in the triumph of righteousness described in *Psalms 1*, *2*, *and 72*. In the New Testament, the apostles’ use of the Psalter to describe the life and ministry of Jesus the Messiah confirms that Jesus alone fulfills the ideal of the godly person presented in the psalms. Only Jesus could please God and secure redemption, happiness, and peace. *Psalm 1* introduces the hopeful anticipation of the final hallelujah (*Ps 150*), when the Lord will remove all evil from his creation and prosper his children.\n\n
1:1	idm60416					 The Lord gives true happiness to all who reject evil and delight in him.\n\n
1:1	idm60422					 **Oh, the joys:** This Hebrew term (*’ashrey*) is used twenty-six times in Psalms. Some translations render it as “blessed,” but a different term (*barak*) is used in contexts of blessing (*5:12*; *45:2*; *107:38*). • The godly do not permit themselves to live under the influence of sinners. Those who do not fear the Lord are **wicked** (*36:1*); they are the enemies of those who love God, those who do right, and the poor and oppressed (see *10:2-13*; *37:14*). The wicked might appear pious (*50:16*) and sometimes enjoy temporary prosperity (*37:35*), but sorrow (*32:10*) and destruction (*1:4-6*) await them when their deeds catch up with them (*9:16*). • Those who go astray (*25:8*) in rebellion against the Lord (*78:17*) are **sinners***;* they commit heinous crimes such as adultery and murder (cp. *Ps 51*). • **join in with:** This expression (literally *sit in the seat of*) depicts a life in bondage to sin (cp. *1:2*; *26:3-7*; *Deut 6:7*). • **Mockers** hate the Lord, scorn his wisdom, and insult anyone who attempts to correct them (*Prov 9:7-8*). They seek only the “wisdom” that justifies their actions. These brash people have little regard for the Lord, his plans, or his children (see *Pss 86:14*; *119:51*, *69*, *78*, *85*, *122*). These three terms (wicked, sinners, mockers) apply to all kinds of ungodly people.\n\n
1:2	idm60461					 The **law** (Hebrew *torah*) **of the** Lord is the full revelation of God’s instructions (see *study note on Deut 4:44*). • **Meditating** is a process of inner reflection that can be positive (*Pss 1:2*; *63:6*; *77:12*; *143:5*) or negative (see *2:1*; *38:12*). The Lord’s word is the object of godly meditation (*119:48*). • **Day and night** includes all times, whether one is walking, standing, sitting, or sleeping (see *Deut 6:7*).\n\n
1:3	idm60482					 The future belongs to the godly.\n\n
1:3	idm60488					 Well-watered **trees** endure and bear abundant fruit (cp. *Jer 17:8*).\n\n
1:4	idm60496					 The coming time of judgment (*1:5*) will carry off **the wicked** and their deeds (*35:5*; *83:13*; *Isa 17:13*; see *study note on Jer 13:24*).\n\n
1:5	idm60508					 The wicked cannot abide the scrutiny of the Lord’s **judgment***;* they are already **condemned** (see *5:5*; *7:6*; *101:7*).\n\n
1:6	idm60520					 The Lord’s care for the righteous and the demise of the wicked both demonstrate the Lord’s principle of retribution (see *Gal 6:7-10*). The brief and futile lives of the wicked will end, whereas the Lord and his saints will triumph (see *Pss 9:5*, *6*, *18*; *10:16*; *37:20*; *73:27*; *92:9*; cp. *142:4*; *Isa 57:1*). • The godly (see *Pss 5:12*; *14:5*) are joyful (*1:1*) because **the** Lord protects and cares for them, hears them when they cry out for justice, and secures their future (see *121:3-4*). • A person’s **path** is their life and character.\n\n
2:1	idm60543					 This royal psalm pertains to the Lord’s appointment of a king descended from David. It celebrates the mission of all the kings in David’s line, and it introduces the hope of an ideal ruler who will accomplish the Lord’s goal of bringing all nations into submission (*2:11*) or to destruction (*2:9*). The New Testament identifies Jesus as this descendant (see *Acts 13:33*; *1 Cor 15:25-27*; *Heb 1:5*; *5:5*; *Rev 19:15*).\n\n
2:1	idm60556					 Their futile paths lead to death (*1:4*, *6*), but fallen human beings unite in opposing the true God and his Messiah.\n\n
2:1	idm60564					 **plans:** The Hebrew verb rendered “meditate” in *1:2* here suggests an attitude of opposing the Lord in speech (*Isa 59:13*) or in thought (*Ps 38:12*; *Prov 24:2*).\n\n
2:2	idm60575					 **The kings** hate the Lord’s established order in the world, so they desire to be independent of him (see *36:4*). They scheme about dominating the Lord’s people (*31:13*; see *83:1-4*). Their goal is to subvert the Lord’s rule in the world by overthrowing **his anointed one** (or *his messiah*); the Lord chose the kings of David’s dynasty to establish his kingdom throughout the earth. The New Testament confirms that Jesus, the appointed and anointed Son of God (*Acts 4:26*; *13:33*; *Heb 1:5*; *5:5*), fulfills the role in which these earlier kings failed.\n\n
2:3	idm60591					 **break their chains:** These kings believe that acknowledging the true God and his chosen ruler will result in their enslavement (*Isa 28:22*; *52:2*; cp. *Lam 3:7*; *Rom 1:1*; *1 Cor 7:22*; *Titus 1:1*).\n\n
2:4	idm60604					 The Lord finds the human threat insignificant. He provided a solution long before their rebellion. He will end their agitation through the appointment of a human agent, a descendant of David’s line who will rule the nations.\n\n
2:4	idm60610					 **rules in heaven:** The Lord’s place in the universe is so certain that he **scoffs** at humans who boast that they can rebel against his power and authority (see *37:13*; *59:8*).\n\n
2:6	idm60620					 **my chosen king:** The Lord establishes his anointed ruler.\n\n
2:7	idm60627					 The Lord adopted **the king** of David’s dynasty to conquer rebellious **nations** by force (see *89:26-27*).\n\n
2:7	idm60636					 **Today I have become your Father:** People in the ancient Near East commonly accepted a father-son relationship between gods and kings. In Israel, the Lord adopted kings as his sons. God set David apart as his most excellent and exalted son (*89:27*). All descendants of David were the Lord’s representatives or agents. As an eternal member of the Godhead (*John 1:1*) and a descendant of David (*Acts 13:33*; *Heb 1:5*; *5:5*), Jesus is the true Son of God.\n\n
2:8	idm60648					 In an example of the suzerain-vassal relationship between the Lord and Israel’s king (see *Deuteronomy Book Introduction*, “Literary Form”), the Lord invites the king to **ask** for favors (see *Ps 21:2*, *4*). • All nations will be subject to David’s descendant, the Messiah.\n\n
2:9	idm60658					 The Lord gives his anointed ruler the power to conquer the nations as his inheritance (*Isa 11:4*; *Rev 2:27*; *12:5*; *19:15*), breaking their rebellion, resistance, and independence.\n\n
2:10	idm60668					 It pleases the Lord when his people submit to him and seek his protection. The wise accept the Lord’s rebuke and desire to repent.\n\n
2:11	idm60674					 **rejoice:** Rulers must welcome the Son as their true and only King. • **Submit to God’s royal son** (or *Submit to God’s royal Son,* or *kiss the son*): Kissing was an expression of submission (*Hos 13:2*). • The Lord gives **joy** to all who fear him (*Ps 1:1-2*) and trust him (*18:30*; *34:22*; *119:1-3*).\n\n
3:1	idm60690					 This group of psalms moves readers from the orderly world of *Pss 1–2* to a disoriented one. The Lord’s anointed cries out while facing enemies, ferocious opposition, evil schemes, and the Lord’s apparent distance.\n\n
3:1	idm60697					 This psalm laments that the expectations raised by *Pss 1–2* have not been met. But even when beset by enemies, godly people need not question the Lord’s just dealings. Rather, they can confidently trust his goodness and expect God to rescue them.\n\n
3:1	idm60704					*title* This sad episode in David’s life (see *2 Sam 15–18*) helps readers keep the promises of *Ps 2* in perspective. The Lord granted victory to his anointed king (*Ps 2*), but the manner and timing of this victory remained in God’s hands.\n\n
3:1	idm60714					 The psalmist’s **many enemies** speak brashly (*4:6*; *12:4*; *40:15*) and question the Lord’s ability to rescue (*10:11*; *22:7-8*; *71:10*). Their words haunt him because it seems that the Lord will not answer his prayer. • These enemies wield great power (cp. *2:1-3*); unlike *Ps 2*, this psalm does not resolve the crisis.\n\n
3:3	idm60729					 The psalmist’s eyes turn from his enemies to the Lord.\n\n
3:3	idm60735					 The psalmist contrasts the contention of his enemies (*3:2*) with the Lord’s provision. The Lord is a **shield** for his people; he turns their defeat and shame into victory and **glory**.\n\n
3:5	idm60744					 By refocusing on the Lord (*3:3-4*) in the midst of his crisis, the psalmist can rest, confident of his **safety** (see *study note on 4:8*). The Lord cares for his servant; he protects him and keeps his mind and heart from fear (*37:17*; *54:4*; *119:116*; *145:14*).\n\n
3:6	idm60757					 The psalmist’s peaceful confidence in the Lord’s protection and care shields him from evil and gives him a new sense of reality (*23:4*; *27:1*, *3*; *46:1*; *56:4*, *11*; *91:5-6*; *118:6*).\n\n
3:7	idm60771					 The psalmist does not seek revenge; instead, he waits for the Lord’s vengeance. • **Arise:** The psalmist calls upon the Lord to take action now.\n\n
4:1	idm60778					 This individual lament includes a prayer for rescue (*4:1*), a rebuke of the adversary (*4:2-3*), an exhortation to the godly (*4:4-5*), and an expression of confidence (*4:6-8*).\n\n
4:1	idm60788					 Waiting for the Lord’s **answer** allows for growth in patience and for the refinement of living faith (*38:15*).\n\n
4:2	idm60796					 The opponents of the godly place their hope in delusions, treachery, and idolatry. • **my reputation** (or *my glory*): The honor of the psalmist, or possibly of the Lord, is at stake.\n\n
4:4	idm60804					 Angry feelings are not sinful, but **letting anger control you** leads to sin (see *37:7-8*; cp. *Eph 4:26-27*, *31-32*). • Instead of acting on their emotions, the godly **think about** their circumstances **overnight**. They might be disturbed as they sleep, but silence opens their hearts to trust in the Lord (*Ps 4:5*).\n\n
4:5	idm60817					 **Offer sacrifices in the right spirit:** Redirecting emotions toward the Lord prevents a godly individual from doing too much self-reflection (*40:6-8*; *51:17*).\n\n
4:6	idm60826					 **your face** (or *the light of your face*): The psalmist seeks God’s favor and peace (*Num 6:25-26*), which can transform darkness into light (see *Ps 27:1*). Confident trust in the Lord is an antidote to anger, resentment, jealousy, and materialism.\n\n
4:8	idm60836					 **Peace** comes from God’s blessing and protection (*4:6*; see *37:11*).\n\n
5:1	idm60845					 This morning prayer (*5:3*) expresses unwavering confidence in the Lord’s help and protection. The psalmist asks for and awaits God’s response (*5:1-3*). He describes the schemes of the wicked in detail but does not get lost in his circumstances. The psalmist also knows that the wicked cannot coexist with God (*5:4-6*, *9*; see *1:5*). He keeps returning to the Lord (*5:7-8*, *10*; see *5:1-3*), and then he prays for the godly community (*5:10-12*; see *3:8*).\n\n
5:1	idm60861					 The request **hear me** appears in several prayers as a call for God’s attention during a time of trouble (*39:12*; *84:8*; *143:1*), as does **pay attention** (*17:1*; *54:2*; *130:2*). The needy ask their God, “Are you listening?”\n\n
5:3	idm60875					 The psalmist begins and ends each day with prayer, awaiting new expressions of God’s fidelity and goodness (*143:8*). • **wait expectantly:** The psalmist does not demand God’s grace but places hope in it (see *Mic 7:7*; *Hab 2:1*).\n\n
5:5	idm60885					 **the proud:** Mockers (see *study note on 1:1*), the wicked (*73:3*; *75:4*), and the arrogant (*10:2*) use their mouths to twist truth and challenge the faith of the godly. • The Lord allows only the godly into his **presence** (see *1:5*). His holiness and justice do not tolerate oppression or those **who do evil**. • **you hate:** The Lord rejects proud sinners (see also *11:5*).\n\n
5:7	idm60901					 God promises his **unfailing love**—his covenant goodness and faithfulness—to his people (see *25:6*; *69:16*; *Lam 3:32*). • **your house:** The godly long to come into God’s presence with reverence and awe (see *Heb 12:28*).\n\n
5:8	idm60913					 God guides those who are obedient, submissive, and patient in waiting for him to **lead***,* provide, and protect them (*27:11*; *43:3*; *143:10*), not those who expect God simply to endorse their own decisions. • Following **the right path** of wisdom leads to the Lord (*27:11*; *61:2*; *139:24*).\n\n
5:9	idm60928					 The psalmist again describes the vile acts of the wicked, who cannot stand in God’s presence.\n\n
5:10	idm60934					 The psalmist prays for the justice and retribution that God promised against the wicked (*1:6*)—those who have **rebelled against** the Lord. • The wicked lay **traps** to kill (*38:12*) or deceive (*140:4-5*).\n\n
5:11	idm60945					 A blessing rests on **all who take refuge in** God (see *18:30*). • Joy and praise make good companions. The godly **rejoice** when they see evidence of God’s rescue. They **sing joyful praises** as a new song (see *33:3*). When the Lord restores peace to this world, puts down evil, and rewards the righteous, they will have lasting **joy** (*9:2-4*; *53:6*; *90:14-15*; *118:24*). • The children of God, who find refuge in him, **love** his **name**. To love his name is to love his very character.\n\n
5:12	idm60963					 The psalmist extends his concern beyond himself to all the **godly.** • A **shield***,* here an image of God’s protection, deflects spears and arrows from its bearer.\n\n
6:1	idm60972					 The occasion for this lament might have been sickness or a mental or spiritual depression from which the psalmist sought healing.\n\n
6:1	idm60978					 The psalmist asks for God’s favor and restoration at a difficult time.\n\n
6:1	idm60984					 **don’t rebuke me . . . or discipline me:** The psalmist does not explicitly connect God’s discipline with sin here (cp. *39:8-11*), but it might be implied.\n\n
6:2	idm60992					 In his longing for God’s response to his prayer, the psalmist grew physically **weak** (*6:6*; see *77:3*; *119:81*; *142:1-3*; see also *Ps 101*). Fasting might have played a part in his **agony***,* but this is not mentioned.\n\n
6:4	idm61006					 The experience was so painful that the psalmist might as well have been **dead***,* or perhaps he feared for his life.\n\n
6:5	idm61014					 **from the grave?** Hebrew *from Sheol?* In the Old Testament, Sheol is the abode of the dead. It is not necessarily associated with punishment.\n\n
6:6	idm61022					 The psalmist is exhausted to the depths of his being from the anguish of his spiritual distance from the Lord (*22:1*; *31:9-10*; *102:5*). • When **eyes** dim, the body is failing (see *13:3*; *31:9*; *38:10*; *Matt 6:22*).\n\n
6:8	idm61036					 In a closing note of triumph, the psalmist reasserts his confidence in the Lord.\n\n
7:1	idm61042					 This psalm consists of a lament (*7:1-2*), an oath of innocence (*7:3-5*), an appeal to God’s justice (*7:6-9*), an affirmation of God’s just kingship (*7:10-16*), and a concluding hymn of praise (*7:17*).\n\n
7:1	idm61053					*title* **Cush***,* an unknown person **of the tribe of Benjamin***,* remained hostile to David.\n\n
7:1	idm61064					 **Persecutors** (a common term for “enemies”) intentionally seek out people in order to destroy them (*31:15*; *56:1-2*; *71:11*; *143:3*).\n\n
7:2	idm61075					 **Like a lion***,* a wicked enemy relentlessly and violently pursues its prey (*10:9*; *17:12*; *22:13*, *21*; *35:17*; *57:4*), but God promises victory (*91:13*).\n\n
7:3	idm61090					 The psalmist swears to his innocence, making himself vulnerable to scrutiny (*7:9*.\n\n
7:3	idm61097					 The psalmist does not claim to be without sin, but he knows that he does not deserve the brutal attacks of his opponents (see *35:7*).\n\n
7:5	idm61104					 **trample:** Cp. *44:5*; *60:12*; *91:13*; *108:13*. • **into the ground . . . in the dust:** Disgrace and shame can lead to death and the grave (*143:3*; see *13:3-4*).\n\n
7:6	idm61118					 With this appeal to God for justice in the world, the psalmist also submits to God’s examination.\n\n
7:6	idm61124					 God’s judgment brings **justice***,* despite the chaos created by adversaries (see *7:11*).\n\n
7:8	idm61133					 The judgment is against the defendants (the nations) and in favor of the **righteous** plaintiff (the psalmist; see *43:1*). • Although not **innocent** of all sin, the psalmist is a person of authentic integrity (see *15:2*; *25:21*; *41:12*; *78:72*; cp. *Job 1:1*, *8*; *9:20*, *22*).\n\n
7:9	idm61150					 God examines **the mind and heart** of each person (see *11:3-4*; *26:2*; *139:1*, *23*).\n\n
7:10	idm61161					 The psalmist moves from his own situation (*7:1-9*) to speak for all the godly who long for redemption (*7:10-16*). He depicts God as the righteous King who vindicates his subjects when they cry out for rescue.\n\n
7:11	idm61169					 The **honest** Lord cannot be bought or bribed, nor does he abuse his power (*9:4*; cp. *82:1-8*).\n\n
7:12	idm61178					 **sword . . . bow . . . deadly weapons . . . flaming arrows:** As the Divine Warrior, **God** goes on the offensive on behalf of himself and his people.\n\n
7:14	idm61186					 **Evil** begins with small words or steps, and gives **birth** to increasingly worse deeds as time goes on (see *Isa 59:4-5*).\n\n
7:17	idm61195					 **I will thank . . . sing praise:** The laments in *Pss 3–7* usually move from lament to praise, as does the Psalter as a whole. • **Most High:** This is an ancient designation for God (see *Gen 14:19*). • God is **just** and reliable, so his order prevails in this world.\n\n
8:1	idm61206					 *Psalm 8* opens the second segment of Book One (*Pss 8–14*). The psalmist celebrates God’s creation and the dignity of the ideal human being (see *Ps 1*). Instead of the world of enemies, wicked people, and distorted justice that is presented in *Pss 3–7*, this psalm promotes an image of the world as God originally created it. A weary person can envision a place of dignity in God’s world.\n\n
8:1	idm61216					 The Lord (Hebrew *Yahweh*), the covenant God of Israel (*Exod 3:15*), also holds the title of **Lord** (Hebrew *’adonay*), the king of the earth. • The word translated **majestic** (sometimes translated “mighty”) can describe kings (*Ps 136:18*), heroes (*16:3*), mountains (*76:4*), or waves breaking on the seashore (*93:4*). While all are awe-inspiring and mighty, the created order pales in comparison with the Lord. • A person’s **name** embodies their reputation. • **The earth** and **the heavens** reveal the Lord’s splendor. All creation worships and praises the Lord (*66:4*; *113:3*; *145:21*).\n\n
8:2	idm61238					 **silencing:** The loud noise of the oppressors contrasts with the praise of God. In the end, the praise of God will overwhelm the sound of evil (*31:18*; *63:11*; *101:5*; *143:12*). • Those who **oppose** God seethe with vindictive anger (*2:1-3*; *44:16*; cp. *149:6-7*).\n\n
8:3	idm61253					 In light of God’s awesome glory, it might seem that people would be insignificant to him. However, he has **crowned them with glory and honor** and placed them over all creation.\n\n
8:3	idm61260					 The nations around Israel worshiped heavenly objects as deities. The sun, **moon***,* and **stars** are indeed immense and glorious, but they are merely **the work of your fingers,** a reason to praise the Almighty.\n\n
8:4	idm61270					 **human beings** (literally *son of Adam*): The Hebrew idiom *son of man* (or *son of Adam*) means a human being. Through the influence of *Dan 7:13-14*, it became a title with divine overtones in the New Testament. See *Heb 2:6-8*, where this passage is quoted.\n\n
8:5	idm61282					 **Yet you made them only a little lower than God:** Humans bear God’s image; the Lord has endowed humans with dignity and charged them to rule (*Gen 1:26-27*). *Hebrews 2:6-8* applies these words to Jesus Christ, the ideal human who fully realized God’s purposes.\n\n
8:6	idm61291					 **gave them charge of everything:** The psalmist is still referring to humans in general. Paul applies these words to Jesus as the perfect man who has made the created order—even death (*1 Cor 15:25-27*)—subject to God and his glory. The New Testament connects these themes of creation and salvation with Jesus Christ (*John 1:1-2*, *14*; *Col 1:16*).\n\n
8:7	idm61302					 **Wild animals***,* including **birds** and **fish***,* remind readers of God’s creation of the animal world in *Gen 1*. Contrary to beliefs among Israel’s neighbors in the ancient Near East, animals are not sacred.\n\n
9:1	idm61314					 This hymn celebrates the Lord’s kingship and victory over evil. It might also serve as a response to the laments of *Pss 3–7*. Some believe that *Pss 9* and *10* should be read together as one psalm in two parts because *Ps 9* includes a title and *Ps 10* does not, and although several letters are missing or inverted, the two psalms connect as an acrostic of the Hebrew alphabet (other such alphabetic acrostics are *Pss 25*, *34*, *37*, *111–112*, *119*, *145*). The ancient Greek and Latin translations treat 9 and 10 as one.\n\n
9:1	idm61331					*title* This psalm was originally **sung to the tune “Death of the Son***,***”** but that tune is no longer known. So also with the tunes mentioned in *Pss 22*, *45*, *56–60*, *69*, *75*, *and 80*.\n\n
9:1	idm61347					 The verb translated **praise** is translated “thank” in *7:17*, suggesting a close connection between *Pss 7* and *9* (see *7:17*; *8:1-2*). **With all my heart** expresses the psalmist’s deep devotion and commitment (*86:12*; *111:1*; *119:10*; *138:1*). • **I will tell:** These stories educate the next generation (*78:4*; *145:4*); when they are not remembered, a generation might easily depart from the Lord (*78:11*, *32*). • The **marvelous things** include the Lord’s judgments on the enemies of his people (*9:4*) and his care for the oppressed (*9:9*). The wonders in creation, in redemption, and in revelation reveal his character and show his power (*89:5*; *111:4*; *119:18*, *27*). His powerful manifestations evoke public praise (*9:1*; *26:7*; *75:1*).\n\n
9:2	idm61379					 **filled with joy . . . sing praises:** The psalmist often connects joy with praises, as one leads to the other (*5:11-12*; *32:11*; *67:4*; *90:14*; *92:4*).\n\n
9:3	idm61391					 The psalmist celebrates God’s judgment of the wicked, which is a testimony to the Lord’s reliable promise to establish his kingdom on earth (*1:6*; *Ps 2*).\n\n
9:3	idm61399					 **retreated . . . staggered:** The Lord overpowers even powerful **enemies** (see *27:2*). Israel also experienced judgment when it resisted the Lord (*107:12*).\n\n
9:4	idm61409					 The **throne** represents the Lord’s royal authority.\n\n
9:5	idm61416					 God created the heavens and the earth with a word (*Gen 1*), and he can bring **nations** to an end with a word (see *Ps 2:5*). Evil and those who do evil will come to an absolute end (*69:28*; *109:13*; *Rev 21:4*).\n\n
9:7	idm61428					 The godly do not put their hope in corruptible human government but in God’s everlasting rule of **justice** and **fairness** (see *Pss 96–100*).\n\n
9:9	idm61437					 The Lord provides **shelter** in dangerous circumstances and **refuge** from powerful and oppressive people. The Psalter includes many similar images of the Lord, such as fortress (*18:2*; *31:2*), rock (*18:2*; *42:9*), strength (*18:1*), and strong tower (*144:2*). These images occur frequently in the royal prayers (see *9:9*; *18:30*). • Even **oppressed***,* afflicted, and marginalized people (*10:17*; *74:21*) can enjoy divine protection. • The **times of trouble** (*10:1*; *20:1*) stand in contrast with appointed times when the Lord openly bestows his favor upon the afflicted (*69:13*; *102:13*; see *Ps 107:6*).\n\n
9:10	idm61463					 Alienation from the Lord might be part of an individual’s experience (*22:1*; *42:9*; *119:8*), yet the psalms affirm that the Lord will not **abandon** his people (*16:10*; *37:25*, *28*).\n\n
9:11	idm61476					 Recognition that the Lord’s judgment falls on some of the wicked (*9:3-6*) and that God promises to judge all evil (*9:7-10*) motivates praise. The psalmist calls on the godly community to join him.\n\n
9:11	idm61484					 The psalm writers often connect the idea that God **reigns** (or* sits,* or *is enthroned*) with a place, such as heaven (*2:4*; see *47:9*), **Jerusalem***,* “between the cherubim” (*80:1*; *99:1*), “on high” (*113:5*), or “at my right hand” (*110:1*). Since the Lord rules the **world***,* all people must know of **his unforgettable deeds** of salvation (see *9:1*; *64:9*; *66:16*; *105:1*).\n\n
9:12	idm61508					 The Lord **avenges** and saves his servants (*18:46*) by righteously judging his enemies on earth (*58:11*). The godly do not seek revenge; they wait for the Lord to vindicate them (*94:1-2*; *Deut 32:35*; *Rom 12:19*).\n\n
9:13	idm61520					 The psalmist returns from a vision of the glorious future to the reality of facing his **enemies** (*9:3*). • The **jaws** (literally *gates)* are a vivid image of the powerful grip of **death** (see *13:3-4*). • **Jerusalem’s gates** provide an intentional contrast to the “gates” of death.\n\n
9:18	idm61533					 Hope requires waiting for the Lord’s rescue or justice (*25:3*, *5*, *21*). The godly find hope, rest, and quietness as they await the Lord (see *1:6*; *27:14*).\n\n
9:19	idm61544					 The psalmist ends his lament with a prayer for the Lord’s intervention and divine vengeance. • **mere mortals . . . merely human:** Humans who have received authority and glory sometimes become oppressive and assume glory for themselves (see *8:4*; *10:18*).\n\n
10:1	idm61553					 The lament of *9:13-20* continues in *Ps 10* (see *study note on Pss 9–10*), but the mood changes from confident assertion to anguished questioning. The psalmist prays for rescue, believing that the Lord, as a just king, takes care of the needy.\n\n
10:1	idm61562					 The opening questions set the mood. The Lord does not seem to hear the prayers of his people (*22:1*, *19*; see *2 Kgs 4:27*; *Isa 1:15*).\n\n
10:2	idm61572					 Wicked and oppressive people might prosper, leaving ugly consequences. Evil can be as dramatic as the psalmist portrays it here, or it could be more subtle.\n\n
10:2	idm61578					 **The wicked** brazenly defy God with their acts and speech (*17:10*; *31:18*; *59:12*; *73:8*; *123:4*). Although the Lord will deal with them (*31:23*), they disturb the righteous (see *5:4-6*) prior to their condemnation and judgment.\n\n
10:3	idm61592					 Unlike those who have **evil desires***,* the godly wait for justice (*10:17*).\n\n
10:4	idm61601					 **God is dead:** See *10:11*; *14:1*.\n\n
10:6	idm61610					 Despite their evil ways (*5:9*; *28:3*; *Rom 3:14*), the wicked expect a future **free of trouble** such as the righteous will enjoy.\n\n
10:8	idm61620					 The wicked rely on outright violence (*11:5*; *37:32*) and deception (*Prov 12:6*; *23:27-28*).\n\n
10:12	idm61630					 With confidence that the wicked will be held responsible for their deeds and that the Lord will care for the helpless, the psalmist prays intensely for rescue from evil.\n\n
10:14	idm61636					 Because the Lord cares for the afflicted, he will **take note** and **punish** evildoers (see *72:14*; *116:15*).\n\n
10:15	idm61646					 The psalmist strongly invokes a curse as he prays (see “*Prayers for Vengeance*” Theme Note). • **Arms** represent an ability to wage war (*18:34*; *44:3*).\n\n
10:16	idm61656					 As the true and just **king***,* God will bring the wicked to an end, as he promises (*1:6*).\n\n
10:17	idm61665					 The psalmist expresses his confidence in the Lord.\n\n
10:18	idm61671					 **Mere people** misuse their power and enslave the very people God wants them to serve (see *9:19-20*; *Luke 22:25-26*).\n\n
11:1	idm61680					 The psalmist affirms his faith in the righteous God. Even though the world appears hopelessly chaotic, both the godly and the wicked can count on God’s justice. The godly can depend on him as a refuge and shelter.\n\n
11:1	idm61686					 God provides **protection** (or *refuge;* see *5:11*; *9:9*; *25:20*) when the foundations of justice collapse. • The **mountains** provide another place of refuge (see *121:1*).\n\n
11:2	idm61699					 In the inevitable battle between the evil and the godly, the wicked cannot tolerate the righteous, so they victimize them. This seems to leave the godly with nothing but questions.\n\n
11:2	idm61705					 The **wicked** live in the **shadows** and create gloom for the godly (*82:5*; *139:11*; *143:3*; *Prov 4:19*).\n\n
11:3	idm61717					 The wicked create a world of darkness (see *82:5*).\n\n
11:4	idm61724					 The righteous King **rules from heaven***,* where his throne is untouched by human corruption (see *2:4*). He examines everyone and sees everything that happens on earth (see *14:2-3*).\n\n
11:5	idm61734					 **hates:** See *5:4-6*; *Prov 6:16-18*. • Wicked deeds result in destruction and **violence** (*Pss 58:2*; *73:6*; *74:20*).\n\n
11:6	idm61747					 God rained **blazing coals** and **burning sulfur** on Sodom and Gomorrah (*Gen 19*) as symbols of judgment (*Pss 18:8*; *120:4*; *140:10*).\n\n
11:7	idm61759					 The godly are assured of the Lord’s favorable presence when they **see his face** (see *23:6*).\n\n
12:1	idm61767					 This community lament seeks the Lord’s help against the prevalence of evil. Because of the Lord’s answer, the godly can face the future knowing that God protects them.\n\n
12:1	idm61773					 Evil becomes so pervasive that the godly pray for rescue (*Isa 57:1*; *Mic 7:2*; cp. *Pss 1:6*; *37:20*; *58:7*; *104:35*).\n\n
12:4	idm61785					 The words **they say** reveal the character of the wicked. They deceive and overpower the godly and arrogantly question the Lord’s purposes.\n\n
12:6	idm61792					 The godly can rely on the Lord**’s promises***,* but not on the lies of the wicked (*12:2-4*). • **Seven times** means totally or completely.\n\n
12:7	idm61803					 The godly know that the Lord cares, even though the wicked continue to oppress them. The Lord sees the corrupt and foolish people who praise evildoers (see *9:19-20*; *14:2-6*).\n\n
13:1	idm61811					 The psalmist’s piercing cry for help becomes a confident song of hope.\n\n
13:1	idm61817					 **How long?** The fourfold repetition expresses agitation and deep anguish (*79:5*).\n\n
13:2	idm61825					 A sense of **anguish** and **sorrow** closes off any perspective of hope (*6:3*). Unless the Lord answers the psalmist’s prayers (*22:1*), death seems inescapable, torturous, and slow (*6:6*; *32:3*; *55:4*; *61:2*; *102:5*; *116:3*). The psalmist hardly knows how to pray; he longs for God’s redemption (*25:17-18*; *31:10*; *38:8*; *39:2*).\n\n
13:3	idm61845					 Only the Lord can bring enlightenment and relief. The psalmist longs for the Lord’s vindication so that his foes will not rejoice.\n\n
13:3	idm61851					 The psalmist’s affliction feels like death (*22:15*; *55:4*; *88:15*; *94:17*; *116:3*).\n\n
13:5	idm61862					 The psalmist no longer hears the ridicule of his foes. Instead, because of his trust in the Lord, he is full of joy.\n\n
14:1	idm61868					 This wisdom psalm contains some characteristics of lament and prophetic speech. The ideals of *Ps 8* have run aground on the reality of foolish human attitudes and sinful actions. With the exception of vv *5-6*, this psalm parallels *Ps 53*.\n\n
14:1	idm61877					 Paul uses phrases from the Greek translation of this passage in his description of the depravity of all people (*Rom 3:10-12*).\n\n
14:1	idm61884					 Also known as **fools***,* the wicked speak to themselves, think, scheme (*10:4*, *6*, *11*), and make claims; however, because they do not heed God’s revelation, they possess no understanding (*14:1*; *39:8*; *53:1*; *74:18*, *22*).\n\n
14:2	idm61900					 From **heaven** (*33:13*; *80:14*; *102:19*), the Lord sees the wicked, who stand out as vile sinners (*11:3-5*). The **entire human race** lacks wisdom and fails to live up to the glory originally given to them (*10:4-11*; see *Rom 1–3*).\n\n
14:4	idm61914					 The evil live at the expense of others (*27:2*; *44:11*; *53:4*; see *Isa 5:8*) and have no reverence or knowledge of God (*Ps 79:6*).\n\n
14:5	idm61925					 Though the wicked perish (*1:5-6*), **God is with** the godly.\n\n
14:7	idm61933					 The psalmist prays for the renewal of God’s relationship with his people. • **Jacob** is a synonym for **Israel** (see *Gen 35:9-10*).\n\n
15:1	idm61942					 The psalms in this section affirm integrity and purity (*17:15*; *18:20-26*; *19:13-14*). They refer to people as dwelling in God’s presence (*16:9-11*; *17:15*) and as not being shaken (*15:5*; *16:8*).\n\n
15:1	idm61955					 In this wisdom poem, the psalmist contrasts the lifestyle of the godly with the actions of fools (*Ps 14*). The questions in this psalm invite readers to examine themselves and to look away from problems with the wicked. The question of who dwells in God’s presence leads into a description of godly character qualities (cp. *24:3-6*; *Isa 33:14-16*).\n\n
15:1	idm61964					 Only the godly may reside in the Lord’s **presence** (*5:4*). As his guests, they experience his hospitality and protection. • **sanctuary** (or *tent*): In David’s time, God’s sanctuary was a tent (the Tabernacle; see *1 Sam 21:6*; *2 Sam 6:17*; *7:6*; *12:20*; *1 Chr 6:32*).\n\n
15:2	idm61979					 The godly speak truthfully and act faithfully in their relationships. Unlike the wicked, they are open and transparent (*12:2-4*).\n\n
15:5	idm61986					 The Lord prohibited Israel from **charging interest** to people in need (*Exod 22:25-27*). • The assurance of God’s presence keeps the godly from destruction (*Pss 16:8*; *46:5*; *125:1*). Their circumstances might shake them temporarily, but they ultimately **stand firm** (*30:6*; *94:18*; *112:6*).\n\n
16:1	idm62001					 In this psalm of confidence, the poet moves quickly from a short petition (*16:1*), to expressions of passionate commitment to God and his people (*16:2-6*), to a conclusion of confident praise (*16:7-11*).\n\n
16:1	idm62010					 The psalmist feels **safe** because the Lord alone offers security (*16:5-6*), guidance (*16:7-8*), and the joy of his presence (*16:9-11*).\n\n
16:2	idm62020					 **I said to the** Lord**:** The various writers of the psalms pray, lament, and praise the Lord throughout the Psalter, and the Lord answers them (see *12:5-6*).\n\n
16:4	idm62030					 The psalmist dissociates himself from ungodly worship, rituals, and words (see *15:3-5*).\n\n
16:5	idm62037					 The **cup of blessing** represents God’s provision for all the psalmist’s needs (*23:5*; see *116:13*; cp. *75:8*; *Isa 51:17*).\n\n
16:6	idm62048					 The **land** is God’s gift for his people (*Deut 18:8*).\n\n
16:7	idm62056					 God’s instruction brings life (*16:11*; see *5:8*; *23:1-3*; *32:8*; *73:24*). • The psalmist so deeply depends on the Lord for strength and joy that he senses that God is **right beside** him (*16:11*; see *73:23*; *109:31*; *110:1*, *5*; *121:5*). • Peter quoted *16:8-11* in his sermon on the day of Pentecost (*Acts 2:25-28*).\n\n
16:9	idm62076					 Knowing that not even death can separate him from the Lord strengthens the psalmist’s confidence. He fears a separation (see *13:3-4*), but he remains confident of seeing the Lord (see *11:7*).\n\n
16:10	idm62084					 The psalmist expresses his confidence that life continues beyond death. The apostles applied this text to the resurrection of Jesus (*Acts 2:25-33*; *13:35*).\n\n
16:11	idm62092					 **with you:** See *16:7-8*; *110:1*.\n\n
17:1	idm62101					 The psalmist pleads for God’s protection and vindication, affirms his own integrity, and prays that the Lord will prevail against his fierce enemies.\n\n
17:1	idm62107					 **comes from honest lips:** Deception characterizes the wicked. The godly reject such deceit as a failure of character and pray for rescue from such people (*5:6*; *43:1*; *120:2*). They love honesty, truth, and integrity (*15:2-3*; *24:4*; *101:7*).\n\n
17:3	idm62120					 The psalmist declares his innocence (*17:1*) and commits himself to integrity by being open to God’s examination.\n\n
17:3	idm62127					 Though he is not perfect, the psalmist commits himself to the Lord. He does not want to **sin** through deception, flattery, or gossip (see *10:7*; *15:2-3*; *17:1*).\n\n
17:6	idm62137					 This prayer for God’s care returns to the petition begun in *17:1-2* for redemption from evil.\n\n
17:8	idm62144					 **as you would guard your own eyes** (literally *as the pupil of your eye*): This metaphor expresses God’s care and affection for the psalmist (see *Deut 32:10*). • The **shadow of** God’s **wings** is a place of his protection from enemies and adversity (*Pss 36:7*; *57:1*; *61:4*; *63:7*; *91:4*).\n\n
17:13	idm62160					 The psalmist confidently prays for the Lord’s victory, knowing that God possesses more power than the evildoers. The psalmist finds his joy in the Lord’s inheritance (*16:5*), whereas the wicked search for joy in this world.\n\n
17:15	idm62167					 **see you face to face:** The psalmist does not allow temporary concerns raised by adversaries to stand in the way of his experiencing a real and lasting relationship with the Lord.\n\n
18:1	idm62174					 This royal drama of divine rescue (also found with minor variations in *2 Sam 22:1-51*) encourages readers who are following the laments and requests for rescue in *Pss 16* and *17*. The psalmist describes the dramatic nature of God’s rescue in three different ways (*18:7-15*, *16-19*, *30-36*). The psalm also extends hope that a future Son of David will be totally victorious over evil (*18:43-50*; cp. *Ps 2*).\n\n
18:1	idm62188					*title* David was a faithful **servant of the** Lord*,* charged with the responsibility of establishing God’s kingdom on earth (see *78:70*; *132:10*; *144:10*). • The Lord **rescued** David **from all his enemies** when he enabled David to conquer them (see *2 Sam 8:1-14*).\n\n
18:2	idm62204					 A **shield** is an image of protection, salvation, and victory (*7:10*; *18:2*, *30*, *35*; *84:11*; *91:4*; *115:9*, *10*, *11*; *119:114*; *144:2*). It evokes a response of trust, waiting, and godly confidence.\n\n
18:3	idm62222					 God deserves praise for his greatness and faithfulness (*48:1*; *96:4*; *145:3*).\n\n
18:6	idm62231					 God dwells in **his sanctuary***,* the heavenly temple (*102:19*; see *14:2-3*). He knows everything, sees everyone, and will vindicate the godly (see *11:3-7*).\n\n
18:7	idm62242					 The psalmist depicts the Lord’s descent from heaven to earth with phenomena such as earthquakes, flames, smoke, darkness, and rain. Creation shudders at God’s marvelous coming as the Divine Warrior (see *97:2-5*) and Judge (see *50:1-6*).\n\n
18:7	idm62250					 The destabilization of the whole **earth** will be a means of God’s judgment (*77:17-18*; *96:9*; *97:4*; *99:1*; *104:32*; *Isa 29:6*; *Mic 1:3-4*; *Nah 1:2-6*; *Hag 2:7*, *21*).\n\n
18:8	idm62267					 **his nostrils . . . his mouth:** The psalmist likens God to an angry person or a fierce creature (see *Job 41:12-22*). • The terrifying images of **smoke***,*** flames***,* and **glowing coals** express God’s wrath against sin.\n\n
18:9	idm62280					 The Lord’s sovereignty extends over all of nature (see *104:2-4*; *148:5-6*).\n\n
18:10	idm62288					 **a mighty angelic being** (Hebrew *a cherub*): See study notes on *1 Chr 28:18*; *2 Chr 3:10-13*.\n\n
18:19	idm62298					 Because God loves and **delights in** the psalmist (see *18:1*), he will save him (*37:23*; *41:11*; *91:14-16*).\n\n
18:20	idm62309					 The psalmist affirms that loyalty is rewarded. He puts his trust in the Lord (see *16:1*) and commits himself to living with integrity (see *Pss 1*, *15*, *24*; see also *19:12-14*).\n\n
18:21	idm62320					 **kept the ways of the** Lord**:** The psalmist faithfully obeys God’s instructions (see *25:8-10*). • **not turned . . . to follow evil:** The psalmist rejects the way of folly (see *Pss 1* and *14*) and chooses the way of wisdom (see *Pss 1* and *15*).\n\n
18:25	idm62335					 The **faithful** God remains true to his character. He loves faithfulness, blamelessness, and purity, and he hates the perverse (see *1:6*).\n\n
18:26	idm62343					 The **pure** have clean hands (see *18:20-24*). • **to the crooked you show yourself shrewd:** The Lord knows each person’s character, and he justly responds to them in kind.\n\n
18:27	idm62352					 **proud:** The Lord hates pride (*101:5*; *131:1*; see *Prov 6:16-17*; *21:4*; *30:13*).\n\n
18:28	idm62364					 **light a lamp:** The Lord renews the psalmist’s life, helping him overcome the **darkness** of adversity (see *Pss 112:4*; *119:105*).\n\n
18:29	idm62374					 **scale any wall:** God helps his servants fight their battles.\n\n
18:30	idm62381					 The psalmist experiences God’s rescue and provision of victory.\n\n
18:30	idm62387					 **perfect:** God’s character has integrity (see *18:26*). • God **promises** to protect his people, and he does so. • Seeking God’s **protection** entails trust and faith. Regardless of his feelings or external circumstances, the psalmist makes a deep commitment to the Lord. He experiences joy (*5:11*; *64:10*) as he awaits the Lord’s rescue (*57:1*).\n\n
18:32	idm62400					 The psalmist’s victories come from the Lord. He completely depends on God.\n\n
18:36	idm62406					 A **wide path** represents freedom and safety (see *4:8*; *119:35*).\n\n
18:37	idm62415					 With help from the Divine Warrior, the psalmist experienced victory over his enemies.\n\n
18:40	idm62421					 Placing a **foot** on the **necks** of the enemy represents total victory (see *Josh 10:23-26*).\n\n
18:43	idm62430					 With God’s victorious help, the psalmist achieved military and political success, thus fulfilling the history of David’s dynasty (*Ps 2*). The previous laments find some resolution in this psalm.\n\n
18:46	idm62437					 The psalmist again reflects on the Lord’s victories. God’s marvelous rescue and the king’s victory are cause for celebration.\n\n
18:47	idm62443					 God vindicates his servant and so fulfills his mission (*Ps 2*; see *47:3*; *144:2*).\n\n
18:49	idm62452					 The psalmist’s vision of **praise . . . among the nations** motivated Paul in his mission to the Gentiles (*Rom 15:9*).\n\n
18:50	idm62460					 God appointed David, his **anointed** ruler, to bring order into God’s world (see *Ps 2*). Both **David** and **his descendants** received this responsibility.\n\n
19:1	idm62470					 God’s wisdom is manifest in heaven (*19:1-4*), in nature (*19:4-6*), in his instruction (*19:7-11*), and in the life of the psalmist (*19:12-14*). Like *Ps 8*, this hymn uses creation to motivate reflection—it is a peaceful oasis after the drama of the lament and victory psalms. The psalm begins with creation as a source of wisdom, then moves to God’s word as the perfect source of wisdom, and ends with the human need for redemption.\n\n
19:1	idm62481					 The created order is an arena of God’s wisdom, and the heavens are the place of God’s dwelling (*2:4*; see *8:1*; *57:5*; *89:6*; *115:3*). From heaven, God observes humanity (*11:4*; *14:2*; *33:13*; *53:2*; *80:14*; *102:19*) and comes to the rescue of his servants (*18:6-8*, *13*; *20:6*; *57:3*; *76:8*; *144:5*). The heavens remain unaffected by human failures and rebellions (see *2:1-4*). They display God’s qualities of fidelity, righteousness (*36:5*; *50:6*; *57:10*; *85:11*; *89:2*, *5*; *97:6*; *108:4*), and wisdom (*136:5*; see *119:89-90*). The heavens reveal the Lord’s glory (see *19:1*) and give evidence of his presence and handiwork.\n\n
19:1	idm62516					 The **glory of God** refers to the splendor or manifest presence of the Creator (*113:4*). • **God** (Hebrew *’el*): *El* is an ancient designation for God that signifies his creative power.\n\n
19:3	idm62527					 God’s wisdom does not need to be spoken. Through creation, it is seen, felt, and experienced. Paul applied this text to condemn Israel for its lack of receptivity to Jesus Christ (*Rom 10:18*). • The **sun** is part of God’s creation, but it is not a deity, as people of other nations in the ancient Near East commonly believed.\n\n
19:7	idm62535					 God’s **instructions** to humans reveal his character and wisdom. God’s instruction is precious and pleasant (*119:103*). It nourishes the person (*Prov 16:24*; *24:14*) and is of more value than objects of human worth (*Ps 81:13-16*).\n\n
19:12	idm62546					 The psalmist knows his faults, so he prays to remain faithful and commits himself to the Lord.\n\n
19:13	idm62552					 An individual who commits **deliberate sins** does so with an insolent (*86:14*) or arrogant (*119:21*, *69*) attitude. • The **great sin** is rebellion (see *32:1*).\n\n
19:14	idm62564					 **words of my mouth . . . meditation of my heart:** The psalmist desires to please God in everything he says and thinks (see *Luke 6:45*; *Rom 12:1-2*).\n\n
20:1	idm62573					 This sequence of psalms expresses the experience of moving from confidence and commitment (*Pss 20–21*), through anguish and abandonment (*Ps 22*), and finally to comfort, insight, and hope (*Pss 23–24*).\n\n
20:1	idm62582					 This royal prayer for God’s victory (*20:1-5*) leads to confidence in God’s rescue (*20:6-8*) and a communal request for God’s response (*20:9*).\n\n
20:1	idm62591					 The community prays for the king’s protection and victory.\n\n
20:1	idm62597					 The title **God of Jacob** affectionately expresses God’s ancient relationship with his people (see *46:7*, *11*; *75:9*; *76:6*; *81:1*, *4*; *84:8*; *94:7*; *114:7*; *146:5*). • **keep you safe from all harm:** See *59:1-2*.\n\n
20:3	idm62616					 **Gifts** and **burnt offerings** express submission to the Lord (cp. *40:6*).\n\n
20:4	idm62625					 **make all your plans succeed . . . answer all your prayers:** These requests could be those stated in *21:3-6* (cp. *27:4*).\n\n
20:5	idm62634					 Troops carried a **victory banner** to battle, under which they gathered and roused one another to action (see *Isa 11:10*, *12*).\n\n
20:6	idm62643					 An individual member of the community (*20:1-5*) responds with a word of assurance and confidence in God’s help.\n\n
20:6	idm62650					 God chose **his anointed king** to be ruler (see *2:7*).\n\n
20:7	idm62658					 **chariots and horses:** These were instruments of war (see *33:16-17*; *76:6*; *147:10*; *Isa 30:16*; *31:1-3*).\n\n
21:1	idm62670					 God’s people thank him for giving victory to the king.\n\n
21:2	idm62676					 The king has experienced **his heart’s desire**—God’s protection and blessing (see *20:5*; see also *2:8*).\n\n
21:3	idm62685					 The king returned victorious from battle and received honor from the people. His greatest honor came from God, who gave him blessings, life, and his presence.\n\n
21:3	idm62691					 **success and prosperity:** See *Prov 10:6*.\n\n
21:4	idm62699					 God offers a rich quality of **life** (*61:6-7*; *91:14-16*; *128:4-6*) characterized by his presence (*16:11*; *23:6*; *27:4*; *36:9*), joy (*16:11*), goodness (*23:6*; *34:14-15*), and protection (*41:2*; *61:7*).\n\n
21:6	idm62718					 God’s **eternal blessings** also bring fullness of life in the present (see *Ps 133*).\n\n
21:7	idm62726					 The king enjoyed victory not because of his strength or intrinsic goodness but because God honored his faith.\n\n
21:8	idm62732					 As long as even a single enemy opposed the king’s authority, God’s kingdom was not fully present. This prayer requests victory over all evil in the world.\n\n
21:9	idm62738					 The **flaming furnace** and **fire** portray the severity of God’s judgment on the wicked. In the Old Testament, this image often refers to hell (*11:6*; *18:8*; *50:3*; *68:2*; *78:21*; *79:5*; *80:16*; *89:46*; *97:3*; *104:4*; *140:10*; see *Isa 66:24*).\n\n
21:10	idm62758					 **children . . . descendants:** Evil will end when God destroys all opposition to himself (*109:13*; cp. *18:50*; *22:30-31*; *25:13*; *102:28*).\n\n
21:13	idm62770					 **Rise up** (or *be exalted,* as in *57:5*, *11*; *108:5*) expresses communal praise and joy in God’s greatness and **power**.\n\n
22:1	idm62782					 All previous laments pale in comparison with this outcry against the enemy and God’s abandonment. The psalm contains two main sections: the lament (*22:1-21*) and praise for redemption (*22:22-31*), which leads naturally to *Ps 23*. The apostles saw in this psalm an expression of the sufferings of Jesus Christ, who ultimately fulfilled the purpose of David’s humiliation, rejection by people, and divine abandonment (*Matt 27:35*, *39*, *43*, *46*; *Mark 15:34*; *John 19:23-24*, *28*; *Heb 2:12*).\n\n
22:1	idm62799					 The psalmist alternates between reflections on his present dire circumstances and memories of the Lord’s past faithfulness; he ends with a prayer for rescue.\n\n
22:1	idm62805					 A deep sense of alienation from God overwhelms the psalmist (see *10:1*).\n\n
22:3	idm62812					 God, the **holy** King, is set apart from all his creation, but he chooses to reveal himself to Israel. • God greatly desires that his people offer **praises** to him.\n\n
22:6	idm62820					 Both the Lord and people reject the psalmist. He vividly describes his anguish (*22:1-2*); he lives like a lowly animal.\n\n
22:7	idm62827					 Everyone **mocks** the psalmist’s confidence in the Lord (see *3:2*; *Matt 27:43*), which shames him (*Pss 44:13-14*; *74:10*; *89:50*; *109:25*).\n\n
22:9	idm62840					 The psalmist reflects on his past relationship with God (see *22:3-5*). The Lord has been his very life.\n\n
22:9	idm62847					 The Lord took care of the psalmist before he could do anything for himself (see *71:6*; *139:13*).\n\n
22:12	idm62855					 The psalmist returns to expressing his anguish and suffering (see *22:1-2*, *6-8*). His trouble comes from human beings who act like beasts.\n\n
22:12	idm62863					 **Bashan***,* a region known for its herds and vegetation, produced strong **bulls** (*68:30*).\n\n
22:14	idm62873					 The psalmist’s sense of being **poured out like water** expresses a meaningless, transitory existence that leaves him depleted.\n\n
22:15	idm62880					 Facing adversity is as horrible as dying of thirst (see *137:6*). • Jesus may have had this verse in mind when he said, “I am thirsty” (*John 19:28*).\n\n
22:16	idm62888					 The wild **pack of dogs** represents fierce and unscrupulous people.\n\n
22:17	idm62895					 **I can count all my bones:** The psalmist’s enemies have utterly shamed him by taking his garments. Jesus also suffered this disgrace (see *Matt 27:35*). • **stare at me and gloat:** Enemies make the psalmist the object of their scorn (see *Pss 35:24*, *26*; *38:16*; *55:3*; cp. *59:10*). • **throw dice:** Literally *cast lots.* The casting of lots was sometimes a way for godly people to find God’s direction (*Lev 16:8*; *Num 27:21*; *Acts 1:24-26*). Here, the lots are thrown simply as a game of chance. The soldiers threw dice for Jesus’ clothing after the crucifixion (*Matt 27:35*; *Mark 15:24*; *Luke 23:34*; *John 19:24*).\n\n
22:19	idm62918					 The psalmist faces his troubles by praying for God’s rescue. Only the Lord has the strength to ward off **dogs**, **lions**, and **oxen**.\n\n
22:20	idm62927					 The **sword** makes evident the lethal intent of the enemy.\n\n
22:22	idm62934					 The psalmist praises the Lord and calls for the godly to join him. He tells of God’s goodness to the needy, including himself.\n\n
22:22	idm62940					 **I will proclaim your name:** The writer to the Hebrews ascribes these words to Jesus (*Heb 2:12*). • **my brothers and sisters:** Literally *my brothers.* In the New Testament quotation, the Greek translation picks up the broader meaning as “my brothers and sisters.”\n\n
22:23	idm62950					 The godly respond with awe (see *22:25*).\n\n
22:24	idm62957					 Unlike his response to the wicked (see *21:8-12*), God cares about the needy and hears their prayers (*51:17*; *69:33*; *102:17*).\n\n
22:25	idm62967					 The psalmist vows to praise the Lord, the great King of the earth (*22:27-28*) who cares for the needy. God alone deserves praise.\n\n
22:25	idm62974					 The **great assembly** might include all nations (*22:27*; *26:12*; *35:18*).\n\n
22:26	idm62984					 God knows his people’s needs and addresses them (*63:5*; *81:16*; *103:5*; *107:9*; *132:15*; *145:16*; *147:14*).\n\n
22:27	idm62997					 **families of the nations:** All clans and tribes of humanity (see *Gen 12:3*; *Rev 5:9-10*) will live in submission to the Lord (*Ps 96:1-3*; see *Pss 2*, *72*; *Isa 2:2-4*; *1 Cor 15:25-27*).\n\n
22:28	idm63011					 The universal kingdom belongs to God alone (*Obad 1:21*).\n\n
22:29	idm63018					 The Lord invites all people, **rich** and poor (*22:26*), to the banquet as long as they **worship** him.\n\n
22:30	idm63027					 **Future generations** will join those from the past who praised the Lord (*22:3-5*). The descendants of the godly will receive blessings (*22:30-31*), unlike the offspring of the wicked (*21:10*).\n\n
22:31	idm63037					 The Lord’s **acts** of redemption (*40:9*; *50:6*; *71:15*, *16*, *24*; *97:6*) demonstrate that he is **righteous** (see *4:1*). His righteousness provides the character required for rule, judicial decisions, and relationships. This virtue leads to harmony and order (see *50:6*).\n\n
23:1	idm63053					 These psalms develop the importance of integrity (*25:4-7*, *12-14*, *21*; *26:6*, *11*; *27:7-12*), God’s shepherding care (*23:1*; *28:9*), God’s guidance (*23:2-3*; *25:5*; *27:11*), God’s goodness (*23:6*; *25:7-8*; *27:13*), and living in his house (*23:6*; *26:8*; *27:4*, *8*).\n\n
23:1	idm63077					 This psalm of trust and confidence in the Lord has been a favorite of God’s people for generations. It expresses assurance of God’s presence in the midst of adversity. It evokes images of the Good Shepherd (*23:1-3*; see *Ezek 34:12*; *John 10:11*) and of the messianic banquet (*Ps 23:5-6*; see *Isa 25:6*; *Rev 19:9*).\n\n
23:1	idm63089					 People in the ancient Near East commonly viewed their rulers as shepherds.\n\n
23:1	idm63095					 The Lord promises to take care of his children (*34:9-10*; *Isa 51:14*). He demonstrated this ability to Israel in the wilderness (*Deut 2:7*) and in the Promised Land (*Deut 8:9*).\n\n
23:2	idm63105					 Sheep **rest** after they have eaten their fill (*Zeph 3:13*; see *Isa 11:7*; cp. *Isa 13:20*; *27:10*). • The Lord **leads** the sheep for their own benefit (see *Ps 5:8*). • Sheep only drink from still water, so the shepherd seeks out **peaceful streams** for his flock.\n\n
23:3	idm63119					 Cp. *19:7*; the Lord’s word **renews my strength.** • The Lord **guides** by rescuing his people from evil (*23:4-5*; see *31:3*), bringing them back to himself (*5:8*; *61:2*), caring (*48:14*; *139:10*), ruling (*67:4*), counseling (*73:24*), protecting (*78:53*; *107:30*; *143:11*), and instructing them in wisdom (*27:11*; see *Prov 4:11*). • The Lord’s **name** guarantees the relationship; he guards his reputation against any accusation of his abandoning his people or allowing them to sin (see *Pss 25:11*; *31:3*; *106:8*; *143:11*).\n\n
23:4	idm63146					 The shepherd used his **rod** and **staff** to fend off danger.\n\n
23:5	idm63154					 A **feast** demonstrates the Lord’s care and mercy toward his people (see *22:26*, *29*). Although **enemies** can watch, they cannot trouble the guests. • The ritual of **anointing** the **head with oil** showed guests **honor** (*92:9-11*), hospitality, and refreshment (*104:15*; *133:2*).\n\n
23:6	idm63170					 The Lord expresses his **unfailing love** through the **goodness** of his presence and other benefits that he alone provides (*69:16*; *86:17*; *109:21*; see *18:6*; *61:4*). He actively bestows care that is greater than the temporary trials imposed by enemies (*7:1*).\n\n
24:1	idm63184					 The shepherd of *Ps 23*, who is also the King of the whole world, takes possession of Zion.\n\n
24:1	idm63191					 The kingdom belongs to the Creator, the Great King (cp. *22:27*).\n\n
24:1	idm63198					 The Lord created and now rules the **earth** and **everything in it** (see *1 Cor 10:25-26*). He sees **all its people** (*Ps 33:14*), regardless of their status (*49:1-2*).\n\n
24:2	idm63210					 God created everything in an orderly and stable manner (see *89:11*; *102:25*; *104:5*).\n\n
24:3	idm63219					 The citizens of the King’s realm include all who seek him. The Lord invites them to enter his presence.\n\n
24:3	idm63225					 These questions invite readers to look away from their problems with the wicked and to examine themselves (see *15:1*). • God’s **holy place** is the holy **mountain**, a reference both to Jerusalem and to heaven.\n\n
24:4	idm63234					 Those with pure **hands** have not shed blood or injured relationships between people (see *9:12*; *15:2-5*). • Those with pure **hearts** commit themselves fully to the Lord, as evidenced in strength of character, transparency, and selflessness (*51:10*; *73:1*; see *Matt 5:8*).\n\n
24:10	idm63247					 **The** Lord** of Heaven’s Armies** reigns from his home, the Temple in Jerusalem (*84:3-5*). He excludes sin and sinners (*24:3-6*) but protects all who dwell in Zion.\n\n
25:1	idm63258					 This individual lament includes instruction in wisdom and a community lament; it begins and ends with an affirmation of trust in the Lord (*25:1-3*, *15-22*). The psalmist prays for guidance (*25:4-7*) and encourages the godly to practice a lifestyle of wisdom (*25:12-14*). In addition to the enemies who trouble him, the psalmist confesses his sins (*25:7*, *11*, *18*) as part of his anguish. Trust develops with understanding God’s character: He is compassionate, faithful, and good (*25:8-10*).\n\n
25:1	idm63272					 The psalmist expresses confidence that the godly will be vindicated and his enemies will not succeed (see *25:15-22*).\n\n
25:1	idm63279					 The psalmist commits himself to the Lord instead of to idols (see *24:3-4*).\n\n
25:2	idm63286					 Enemies would **rejoice** by singing a victory song.\n\n
25:4	idm63293					 In this prayer for guidance, compassion, and forgiveness, the psalmist turns to the Lord for instruction in wisdom. He confesses his past failures and acknowledges that his hope lies with his merciful Savior.\n\n
25:4	idm63299					 The **right path***,* the path of wisdom (see *5:8*), means being open to instruction that leads to life (*27:11*; *43:3*; *73:24*; *119:12*).\n\n
25:5	idm63312					 Biblical **hope** does not mean wishing for an event to turn out favorably. Hope trusts the Lord’s will and gives the courage to face disappointments (*33:22*; *130:5*).\n\n
25:6	idm63321					 **compassion:** See also *51:1*; *57:1*; *103:8*.\n\n
25:8	idm63331					 The Lord keeps his people close to himself.\n\n
25:11	idm63337					 The psalmist again asks forgiveness for his **many sins** (*25:7*; *32:1-5*). The sins of Israel’s kings demonstrated the weaknesses inherent in David’s dynasty and the reasons for its failure in Old Testament Israel (see *Ps 89*).\n\n
25:12	idm63347					 Those who fear the Lord will receive further instruction and experience God’s presence (*25:14*) and blessing (*25:13*).\n\n
25:13	idm63355					 **prosperity:** See *23:6*. • **inherit the land:** Unlike the wicked, who will perish (*1:6*), the godly have a secure future. In the end, God will bless them, and their blessings will endure (see *37:9*, *11*, *22*, *29*, *34*; *Isa 57:13*; *Matt 5:5*).\n\n
25:15	idm63372					 The psalmist expresses confidence in the Lord, commits to a life of integrity, and prays for rescue.\n\n
25:15	idm63378					 **the traps of my enemies:** See *5:9-10*; *31:4*; *140:5*; *Prov 3:26*.\n\n
25:17	idm63389					 The psalmist can find no relief (see *4:1*; *13:1-2*) as his **problems go from bad to worse**. He associates his anguish with sin, but he does not elaborate on the nature of his sin (see *25:7*, *11*).\n\n
25:19	idm63400					 Knowing that the Lord hates violent people (see *11:5*), the psalmist pleads with God to deal with these **enemies**.\n\n
25:21	idm63408					 Just as it opened, the psalm closes with a commitment of trust and **hope** (see *9:18*; *25:5*).\n\n
26:1	idm63417					 In this individual lament, the psalmist prays for redemption on the basis of his own innocence and the Lord’s justice.\n\n
26:1	idm63423					 The psalmist opens himself to divine examination of his life, especially in the areas of his character and devotion.\n\n
26:3	idm63429					 For God’s **truth** to become part of one’s character requires a habitual commitment.\n\n
26:4	idm63436					 Because of his devotion to the Lord (*26:1-3*), the psalmist dissociates himself from evil people (see *1:1*).\n\n
26:6	idm63444					 The psalmist demonstrates his loyalty to the Lord through pious rituals, praise, and acknowledgment of the Lord’s presence in the Temple.\n\n
26:6	idm63450					 Ritual purity required the worshiper to **wash** their **hands***,* symbolic of separation from evil and evildoers (see *73:13*). • The **altar** symbolizes God’s presence (*43:4*).\n\n
26:8	idm63462					 The **sanctuary** symbolized the manifest **presence** of the Lord (see *18:6*).\n\n
26:9	idm63471					 **Don’t let me suffer:** The end of the godly cannot be the same as that of the wicked.\n\n
26:12	idm63478					 The psalmist’s footing on **solid ground** represents salvation (cp. *143:10*). • **publicly:** Or *in the great assembly* at the Temple (*26:6-8*; *22:25*).\n\n
27:1	idm63490					 This psalm mixes two genres—a psalm of confidence (*27:1-6*) and an individual lament (*27:7-14*)—held together by the theme of longing for the Lord’s presence. The psalmist focuses on the Lord; his circumstances are secondary. The strength of the psalmist’s faith is expressed in his openness to the Lord’s instruction, timing, and priorities.\n\n
27:1	idm63498					 The psalmist acknowledges the Lord at the center of his life (*27:1*). Because of God’s presence, he engages his adversaries with confidence. They cannot intimidate him or penetrate his inner security.\n\n
27:1	idm63505					 **Light** expresses the Lord’s goodness (*27:13*; see *4:6*; *23:6*; *31:19*; *38:10*; *43:3*; *56:13*).\n\n
27:2	idm63519					 The psalmist’s enemies seek to **devour** him by living at his expense (see *study note on 14:4*).\n\n
27:3	idm63527					 **remain confident:** See *25:2*; *26:1*.\n\n
27:4	idm63536					 Searching for and enjoying the Lord’s presence provides the psalmist’s foundation for confidence and security. He lives in the assurance of God’s protection and looks forward to offering sacrifices of thanksgiving and praise (see *18:6*).\n\n
27:5	idm63543					 **sanctuary** (or *tabernacle*): This early shrine was the Israelites’ place of worship before the Temple was constructed.\n\n
27:6	idm63551					 **hold my head high:** A sign of victory. • The granting of the request of *27:4* prompts **sacrifices with shouts of joy**.\n\n
27:7	idm63560					 The psalmist requests the Lord’s mercy, presence, and instruction. God is the psalmist’s greatest good; enemies and other circumstances are peripheral.\n\n
27:7	idm63566					 Unlike the wicked (*10:4*), who only want a temporary advantage (*78:34-36*), the godly search for the Lord as a thirsty person searches for water in the desert (*63:1*; *105:4*; *119:2*, *10*; *Matt 6:33*). They act wisely (*Ps 34:10*, *14*) while waiting for the Lord to resolve their crisis (*34:4*; *69:6*; *77:2*; *119:58*).\n\n
27:13	idm63585					 The psalmist expresses confidence and hope in the Lord’s presence. To live in faith means to **wait patiently** in recognition of the Lord’s goodness. Such a life is not always pleasant for the godly (*42:2-3*; *43:5*), but their future is secure (*37:9*; *130:7*; see *9:18*).\n\n
28:1	idm63597					 In this individual lament, the psalmist pleads for justice and mercy. He expresses confidence in the Lord’s strength and faithfulness, and he intercedes for the Lord’s people.\n\n
28:1	idm63603					 The psalmist urges the Lord to listen; his urgency flows out of the tension between his deep relationship with the Lord and the adversity he faces.\n\n
28:1	idm63609					 **if you are silent:** The psalmist appeals to the Lord to take action (*35:22*; *50:3*; *83:1*; *109:1*).\n\n
28:2	idm63620					 It was common to **lift** up one’s **hands** in a gesture of devoted prayer (*63:4*; *134:2*).\n\n
28:3	idm63630					 The psalmist curses his enemies, asking God for retribution and vindication.\n\n
28:5	idm63636					 The wicked do not acknowledge the difference between the sacred and the common, so they have no respect for the Lord’s creation, redemption, or revelation.\n\n
28:6	idm63642					 The psalmist anticipates rescue because of his confidence in the Lord’s justice.\n\n
28:7	idm63648					 **my strength and shield:** The Lord protects the psalmist (see *59:9*, *17*).\n\n
28:9	idm63657					 The poem closes with intercession for the Lord’s people. • **Bless Israel, your special possession:** See *29:11*; *133:3*.\n\n
29:1	idm63666					 This nature hymn in praise of the Creator declares that the Lord holds all power over nature. God uses the same unsurpassed strength to care for his people.\n\n
29:1	idm63672					 The psalmist issues a call to **honor** the Lord for his power (cp. *96:7-8*). • **you heavenly beings:** Angels or deities who, some believed, held special powers. The psalmist did not believe in other deities but called on people who thought they were real to look to the Lord as the only God.\n\n
29:3	idm63681					 The word translated **voice** (Hebrew *qol*) can also mean “noise” (*1 Kgs 1:45*) or “thunder” (*Joel 3:16*). The Lord’s voice is awe-inspiring, and it dominates whatever rumblings people might attribute to other deities.\n\n
29:5	idm63691					 The **cedars of Lebanon** were known for their size and quality (see *Isa 2:13*).\n\n
29:6	idm63699					 **Lebanon’s mountains** and **Hermon** are high mountains to the north of Israel. • The Lord can cause even immense **mountains** to shake at his command (see *114:4*).\n\n
29:8	idm63709					 The **wilderness of Kadesh** was located south of Judah. God’s voice can be heard throughout the land, from the north (*29:6*) to the south.\n\n
29:10	idm63717					 The image of powerful **floodwaters** connects with the Genesis flood (*Gen 6:17*). The Lord **reigns as king** over the whole created order; no one contests his kingdom.\n\n
29:11	idm63726					 The ruler of nature **blesses** his people **with peace** (see *28:8-9*; *37:11*; *133:3*).\n\n
30:1	idm63737					 This individual thanksgiving psalm opens in praise to the Lord for his salvation (*30:1-3*), then contrasts God’s favor with his anger (*30:4-7*), and ends with a transformation from mourning to dancing (*30:8-12*).\n\n
30:1	idm63746					*title* Perhaps **David** wrote this psalm in advance for **the dedication of the Temple***,* making his own experience representative of the nation’s.\n\n
30:1	idm63756					 The psalmist praises God for his triumph over adversity, which he likens to salvation from the grave.\n\n
30:1	idm63762					 **I will exalt you** is a call to lift up the Lord’s name in praise and thanksgiving (*34:3*; *81:1*; *99:5*, *9*; *107:32*; *118:28*; *145:1*; see *Exod 15:1*; *Isa 25:1*). • **you rescued me:** God pulled the psalmist from death (*Ps 30:3*). • In his justice and care, God **refused to let** the psalmist’s **enemies triumph** (see *26:9*; *27:12*; *28:3*; *31:8*).\n\n
30:4	idm63786					 The godly should celebrate the Lord’s acts of rescue with song and **praise** (*33:21*; *97:12*; *103:1*; *105:3*; *145:21*).\n\n
30:6	idm63798					 **Nothing can stop me now!** The psalmist confesses his presumptuous attitude (cp. *32:3-4*). • **secure as a mountain:** In the psalms, this phrase creates a powerful image of stability and of God’s control (see *11:1*; *18:7*; *36:6*; *46:2*; *72:3*; *76:4*; *83:14*; *97:5*; *114:4*, *6*; *125:2*). • **I was shattered:** The absence of God’s favor destroys the security of the proud (cp. *104:27-30*).\n\n
30:8	idm63820					 The psalmist faced death (also in *30:1-3*)—perhaps literally, perhaps figuratively. But when he turned to the Lord, the Lord rescued him and turned his **mourning into joyful dancing**. Only God’s favor can permanently and powerfully overcome human failure and the depths of despair.\n\n
31:1	idm63828					 The psalmist encourages the godly to find refuge in the Lord and wait for his salvation. Despite having had a death-like experience, he testifies to the Lord’s faithfulness. This psalm foreshadows the suffering of Jesus (*Luke 23:46*).\n\n
31:1	idm63835					 The Lord offers refuge to anyone who comes to him for protection. The psalmist trusts in and submits to the Lord. See also *71:1-3*.\n\n
31:2	idm63842					 The psalmist issues an urgent call for the Lord to pay attention to his desperate situation (*71:2*; *88:2*; *102:2*).\n\n
31:5	idm63851					 **I entrust my spirit into your hand:** Whether he lives or dies, the psalmist will trust his Lord. Jesus uttered these words on the cross just before he died (*Luke 23:46*).\n\n
31:6	idm63859					 Trust in the Lord requires confidence that he has our best interests at heart.\n\n
31:8	idm63865					 A **safe place** literally means a broad place, in contrast to a “narrow” or constricted place of distress (see *18:19*).\n\n
31:9	idm63873					 In this prayer for mercy, the psalmist wedges a description of the intensity of suffering and the pain of rejection between two affirmations of trust (*31:6*, *14*).\n\n
31:10	idm63881					 **wasting away from within:** This is a powerful description of how despair takes a toll on our physical well-being.\n\n
31:14	idm63888					 Hope does not confide in frail and changeable human beings but only in the Lord. The sufferer entrusts himself to God while waiting for the Lord’s justice.\n\n
31:15	idm63894					 **My future is in your hands:** To relinquish control of timing is one way to express submission.\n\n
31:17	idm63901					 The psalmist, who did not deserve to be **disgraced***,* invokes the principle of retribution (see *study note on 1:6*; see also “*Prayers for Vengeance*” Theme Note).\n\n
31:19	idm63911					 The psalmist thanks the Lord for answering his prayer (*31:1-18*) and rescuing him.\n\n
31:19	idm63918					 Since the godly are under the Lord’s protection and shelter, evil has no power over them.\n\n
31:21	idm63924					 **Praise the** Lord**:** The psalmist expresses his joy at the experience of God’s goodness and love. Throughout his ordeal, the Lord has cared for him.\n\n
31:23	idm63933					 Out of his own pain and renewed awareness of the Lord’s goodness, the psalmist turns to others who suffer. He holds out the promise of God’s loving care for those who persevere in hoping for the Lord.\n\n
32:1	idm63939					 This wisdom psalm of confession and thanksgiving encourages and exhorts the godly to learn from the psalmist’s experience of sin, denial, confession, and forgiveness. This psalm was one of the seven psalms of penitence used in the early church (also *Pss 6*, *38*, *51*, *102*, *130*, *143*).\n\n
32:1	idm63951					 The Lord’s forgiveness restores people to fellowship with him, clears them of **guilt***,* and gives them great **joy**. Paul quoted this text when explaining justification by faith alone (*Rom 4:4-8*).\n\n
32:3	idm63961					 The psalmist acknowledges his own sin (see *19:12-13*; *25:7*, *11*, *15-22*) and his resistance to confessing sin. The Lord pressed him hard until he confessed his guilt.\n\n
32:4	idm63971					 The psalmist attributes his suffering directly to the Lord’s **hand of discipline** (cp. *38:2*; *39:10*).\n\n
32:5	idm63980					 God has forgiven the **guilt** and **rebellion** of *32:1*. The Lord’s nature is to reconcile and forgive (*78:38*; *85:2*; *130:4*), but he requires confession and repentance.\n\n
32:6	idm63992					 The **godly** will learn from the psalmist’s experience to pray for forgiveness before it is too late.\n\n
32:7	idm63999					 The Lord promises to be his people’s **hiding place** (*31:20*). Instead of being overwhelmed by terror (*31:13*), the psalmist is surrounded by **songs of victory**.\n\n
32:8	idm64009					 God interrupts the psalmist’s teaching with a message that invites the godly to receive the Lord’s wisdom (see *5:8*; *23:3*; *25:4-6*).\n\n
32:9	idm64018					 The **senseless** person is not wise. Rejecting the Lord’s counsel ruins life and makes one like an animal (see *Isa 1:3*; *Jas 3:3*).\n\n
32:10	idm64027					 Difficulties common to all of life will ensnare the wicked, whereas the Lord promises to protect the godly with his care.\n\n
33:1	idm64033					 This hymn of creation (see also *Pss 8*, *19*, *104*, *145*) might be a continuation of *Ps 32*. It exhorts readers to praise God (*33:1-3*), to recognize the power of his word in creation (*33:4-7*), and to fear the Creator (*33:8-11*). It offers hope to forgiven sinners (*Ps 32*) that they can live a new life in the fear of the Lord and under divine protection.\n\n
33:1	idm64048					 The psalmist exhorts **the godly** to praise the Lord **with melodies***,* with **a new song***,* and with **skillfully**-played music.\n\n
33:4	idm64060					 God’s **word** displays his character and his power.\n\n
33:7	idm64067					 The nations surrounding Israel thought that the **sea** had divine power, but it is under God’s control, within **boundaries** that he set (see *104:8-10*).\n\n
33:8	idm64076					 **Fear** of the Lord begins with awe for God and for his powerful word. His word created everything and continues to order and sustain creation. He **frustrates** the plans of people who oppose his will.\n\n
33:8	idm64084					 The power of the Lord extends to all the nations (see 2; *96:1-3*).\n\n
33:10	idm64091					 The **plans** and **schemes** of the mighty will not prevail, except by God’s will (see *Isa 8:9-10*).\n\n
33:11	idm64100					 God’s word still orders creation and will do so **forever**. • God’s **intentions** are marvelous (*40:5*; *92:5*).\n\n
33:12	idm64110					 People who fear God are **chosen as his inheritance** (see *33:13-19*); this excludes rebellious people (*78:62*).\n\n
33:13	idm64119					 From the heavens, the Lord searches out and cares for anyone who fears him (see *14:2-3*).\n\n
33:16	idm64126					 **army . . . great strength . . . warhorse:** Even military might is under God’s control (see *33:10-11*; *Eccl 9:11*).\n\n
33:18	idm64135					 God **watches over** all who live by his counsel (*32:8*). He protects, rescues, and remains close to them (*34:15-22*).\n\n
33:20	idm64144					 The godly respond to this magnificent vision of God’s power in creation and in the affairs of the world with an affirmation of trust, commitment, joy, and hope as they pray and wait for God’s rescue.\n\n
33:22	idm64150					 Using a play on words, the psalmist contrasts his people’s sure **hope** (Hebrew *yakhal*) in the Lord with the supposed strength (*33:17*; Hebrew *khayil*) of the horses of the wicked.\n\n
34:1	idm64160					 This wisdom psalm includes a thanksgiving hymn (*34:1-7*) that celebrates the Lord’s care for and protection of godly sufferers. It also includes an invitation to wisdom (*34:8-14*) and an exposition of wisdom concerning the Lord’s care for the needy and the suffering of the wicked (*34:15-22*).\n\n
34:1	idm64169					*title*** Abimelech** is another name for Achish (see *1 Sam 21:10-15*). The body of the psalm makes no explicit connection to this event.\n\n
34:1	idm64178					 The psalmist exhorts the **helpless** to join him in praise.\n\n
34:5	idm64185					 The psalmist narrates his experiences of answered prayer.\n\n
34:7	idm64191					 The **angel of the** Lord represented the Lord’s presence during the wilderness journey. He protected Israel from the forces of Egypt (*Exod 14:19-20*), and he will guard all the godly (*Ps 91:11*).\n\n
34:8	idm64201					 The godly encourage everyone to seek wisdom, to fear the Lord, and to place themselves under the protection of the Lord’s angel.\n\n
34:9	idm64207					 Fear of the Lord includes reverence and respect, and it motivates a life of wisdom (see *Prov 1:7*; *9:10*).\n\n
34:11	idm64215					 Wisdom contains three components: fearing the Lord (*34:11*), doing good (*34:14*), and rejecting evil (*34:13*).\n\n
34:11	idm64224					 Anyone who listens, even **children***,* can become wise followers of God.\n\n
34:12	idm64232					 Peter quotes this passage in his instructions for peaceful living (*1 Pet 3:10-12*).\n\n
34:13	idm64239					 Godly people control their words; **speaking evil** and **telling lies** are foolish (see *10:7*; cp. *17:1*).\n\n
34:14	idm64249					 The way of **peace** leads to harmony and order, whereas **evil** destroys them (see *37:11*).\n\n
34:15	idm64258					 The Lord distinguishes between wise and foolish people; he shows his concern for the wise by rescuing them from trouble (*34:15*, *17-20*), but he destroys the foolish (*34:16*, *21*).\n\n
34:18	idm64268					 Those who are **brokenhearted** possess a spirit of deep contrition and dependence on the Lord. God accepts this spirit as a proper sacrifice (*51:17*). The wicked hate the brokenhearted (*109:16*), but the Lord heals them (*147:3*; see *Isa 57:15*; *61:1*).\n\n
34:19	idm64280					 The godly might suffer, but the Lord will reward them in the end. Similarly, the wicked might prosper for a time, but ultimately they will perish (*1:6*; *34:15-16*).\n\n
34:20	idm64288					 **Bones** represent a person’s entire being (see *6:2*). • **not one of them is broken:** John applied this statement to Jesus at the crucifixion (*John 19:36*).\n\n
35:1	idm64298					 In this lament, the Lord’s troubled servant calls for God to see his circumstances and vindicate him.\n\n
35:4	idm64304					 The psalmist longs for the Lord’s salvation. The language seems vindictive, but it arises from a desire for justice and for the Lord to care for the needy and oppressed.\n\n
35:6	idm64310					 A **path** that is **dark and slippery** suggests instability and untimely doom under the Lord’s judgment (see *69:23*; *73:18*; *82:5*; *107:10*; *143:3*). • The **angel of the** Lord is an agent of judgment as well as salvation.\n\n
35:10	idm64325					 Nothing in the universe can **compare** with the Lord (see *86:8*; *89:6*, *8*; *Isa 40:18*, *25*).\n\n
35:11	idm64337					 The psalmist presents the Lord with the reasons for his suffering. Evil has many faces. He is tired and worn out, and he knows that only the Lord can help him.\n\n
35:11	idm64343					 **Malicious witnesses** want nothing but violence (see *11:4-6*; *54:3*).\n\n
35:16	idm64352					 The psalmist’s attackers **snarl** to express their bitter envy.\n\n
35:19	idm64359					 In this prayer for vindication, the psalmist’s crisis looms so large that a resolution must be found in the Lord. The psalmist has taken the high road, believing that vengeance belongs to the Lord. God’s patience hardens the hearts of the wicked and gives them reasons to justify their evil lifestyle.\n\n
35:19	idm64365					 John applied this claim of innocence (see also *69:4*) to Jesus (*John 15:25*).\n\n
35:21	idm64373					 **Aha! . . . Look:** Both words translate the same expression of glee (Hebrew *he’akh*).\n\n
35:26	idm64382					 The psalmist calls on the Lord to judge the wicked and to rescue the godly and bring them joy.\n\n
36:1	idm64388					 This lament contrasts the world of folly devised by the wicked with the world of wisdom created and sustained by the Lord. The wicked care only about themselves, whereas the Lord cares for all of creation. He will intervene to bring about justice in his world. The righteous will enjoy his protection, but the wicked will perish.\n\n
36:1	idm64394					 Fools despise what is wise and good as they pursue evil.\n\n
36:1	idm64400					 **no fear of God:** Paul includes this phrase in his description of the depravity of all people (*Rom 3:18*).\n\n
36:5	idm64408					 As the source of wisdom, the Lord is reliable and incomparable. His faithful care extends to all parts of the created order.\n\n
36:5	idm64414					 God’s all-encompassing goodness surpasses that of the created order. God graciously meets his people’s practical needs.\n\n
36:6	idm64420					 All creatures live by God’s grace (*1 Tim 4:10*).\n\n
36:7	idm64427					 God invites **all humanity** to the banquet in his **house** (cp. *Prov 9:1-6*).\n\n
36:9	idm64436					 **Light** represents salvation and celebration (*18:25-29*; *27:1*; cp. *35:6*).\n\n
36:10	idm64446					 Since God’s wisdom extends to all of creation, it protects the godly.\n\n
36:12	idm64452					 The psalmist remains confident that the disorder caused by the wicked (*36:1-4*) will end when they meet their demise.\n\n
37:1	idm64459					 This psalm elaborates on the problems posed in *Ps 36*: How should the godly respond to the reality of evil? When will the Lord bring justice? Why does he permit the wicked to destroy his created order? *Psalm 37* offers clear responses that reduce the tensions of life (*37:1-9*, *34*) and promise that the meek will have a future (*37:10-11*, *39-40*). The alternating contrast between the godly and the wicked emphasizes the futility of folly (*37:12-24*, *27-33*). The personal observations of the psalmist add a human touch (*37:25-26*, *35-38*). He encourages viewing the inheritance of the land from a long-range perspective: The earth belongs to the Lord, who will give it to those he blesses—the lowly and godly who trust in him, put their hope in him, and follow him (see *37:9*, *11*, *22*, *29*, *34*; see also *Isa 57:13*; *Matt 5:5*).\n\n
37:1	idm64482					 The wise respond to evil by trusting in the Lord. Trust includes five dimensions: (1) renouncing irritability and envy (*37:1-2*); (2) delighting in the Lord (*37:3-4*); (3) submitting to the Lord (*37:5-6*); (4) practicing patience in hope (*37:7*); and (5) avoiding anger (*37:8-9*).\n\n
37:1	idm64493					 **envy:** The jealous desire to have what others enjoy leads to further sin (*73:3*; *Prov 3:31*; *Jas 1:14-15*; *4:1-2*).\n\n
37:2	idm64504					 Finite existence is part of the human condition (see *90:5-6*; *92:7*; *102:4*, *11*; *103:15*; *129:6*; *Isa 40:7-8*).\n\n
37:3	idm64517					 The antidote to irritability and envy (*37:1*) is trust in the Lord.\n\n
37:3	idm64524					 To **do good** means cultivating a devotion to wisdom (see *34:14*; *Prov 3:5-7*).\n\n
37:4	idm64533					 To **take delight in the** Lord means aligning with the Lord’s way in order to enjoy him.\n\n
37:6	idm64541					 **Justice** occurs when the Lord’s will triumphs and the godly experience his rescue (*Isa 45:8*; *51:5-6*; *58:8*, *10-11*).\n\n
37:7	idm64552					 **Be still:** We should let the Lord be God rather than taking matters into our own hands.\n\n
37:8	idm64559					 Irritability and anger quickly corrode character.\n\n
37:9	idm64565					 The wicked will not **possess the land***;* those who **trust in the** Lord will. The Lord promises an inheritance because he is committed to caring for his people.\n\n
37:11	idm64575					 The Lord is the author of **peace** (*85:10*)—he brings peace to a chaotic world (*29:11*; *37:11*; *85:8*; *147:14*). His wisdom guides **the lowly** into the way of peace (*119:165*; *Matt 5:5*).\n\n
37:12	idm64590					 **The wicked** seek to destroy the Lord’s order, but he defeats them.\n\n
37:12	idm64597					 The wicked **snarl** to express their bitter envy. They plot to bring an end to the godly, but the Lord derides them because they cannot succeed (*2:4*).\n\n
37:14	idm64605					 The weapons of the wicked will turn against them (cp. *7:12-13*).\n\n
37:16	idm64612					 Being wise with modest means is **better** than having prosperity and power and being wicked (*Prov 15:16*; *16:8*, *19*; *17:1*; *28:6*).\n\n
37:18	idm64624					 The Lord cares for the blameless in this life and for eternity, but the wicked will perish.\n\n
37:20	idm64630					 **Smoke** depicts the temporary nature of life (*68:2*; *102:3*).\n\n
37:21	idm64639					 To **borrow and never repay** is a behavior of a crooked lifestyle. • **Generous givers** freely share what they freely receive from the Lord (see *111:5*; *112:5*).\n\n
37:23	idm64649					 The rectitude and strength of a godly person’s life comes from the Lord (see *Prov 4:12*; *14:15*; *16:9*; *20:24*).\n\n
37:25	idm64659					 The Lord does not abandon his children or their descendants.\n\n
37:27	idm64665					 The **godly** are wise; they do good and reject evil. The Lord cares for them, protecting them and ensuring that they receive their rightful portion of **the land** as their inheritance. The **wicked** might try to **ambush** the **godly***,* but they will not succeed.\n\n
37:30	idm64677					 **The godly** base their **counsel** on the Lord’s wisdom.\n\n
37:31	idm64685					 **They have made God’s law their own:** The godly internalize God’s wisdom and instructions (see *119:11*; *Jer 24:7*; *31:31-34*).\n\n
37:35	idm64695					 The **wicked** might appear to be **flourishing like a tree** (cp. *52:8*; *92:12-13*), but they eventually die and are forgotten (*37:2*).\n\n
37:39	idm64706					 The Lord provides strength for his people.\n\n
38:1	idm64712					 This psalm is a lament and prayer for healing. The psalmist’s suffering is associated with his unconfessed sin. He confesses his sin and entrusts his case to the Lord.\n\n
38:1	idm64718					*title* **asking God to remember him:** The meaning of this phrase is uncertain (also in *70:title*).\n\n
38:1	idm64728					 These verses form a prelude to the psalmist’s confession (*38:18*) and describe his woeful condition.\n\n
38:1	idm64735					 The psalmist’s **sins** had triggered the Lord’s **anger** and **rage***,* resulting in the **arrows** and **blows** of **discipline** and **rebuke***;* as a result, his **whole body is sick**.\n\n
38:3	idm64751					 Sin can lead to sickness and even death (*1 Cor 11:30*). Whether the psalmist actually felt physically ill or his sickness was a metaphor for emotional turmoil, he knew that it came from God and threatened his life (see *Pss 32:3*; *39:10*).\n\n
38:4	idm64760					 The psalmist’s **burden** results from sin (see *40:12*; *41:4*; cp. *Gen 4:13*).\n\n
38:5	idm64770					 The severity of God’s punishment brings anguish that affects every part of the psalmist’s being.\n\n
38:9	idm64776					 The psalmist longs for a restored relationship with God, but he feels alienated. He finds himself lost and alone as his friends disappear.\n\n
38:13	idm64782					 The psalmist suffers quietly before his opponents (see *Isa 53:7*).\n\n
38:15	idm64789					 The Lord alone will resolve the conflict (*9:18*; *27:14*; *37:9*, *34*).\n\n
38:17	idm64799					 No longer able to endure his suffering and teetering **on the verge of collapse** (cp. *15:5*), the psalmist confesses his sin (see *32:5*).\n\n
38:19	idm64808					 That the psalmist’s enemies hate him **without reason** compounds his pain.\n\n
38:22	idm64815					 Asking the Lord to act quickly in times of great need is common in the Psalter (*22:19*; *31:2*; *40:13*; *69:17*; *70:1*; *71:12*; *79:8*; *102:2*; *141:1*; *143:7*). However, wisdom and experience teach that God’s people must often wait for him to act (*27:14*; *37:7*; *Isa 8:17*; *40:31*).\n\n
39:1	idm64835					 This prayer for rescue reflects the psalmist’s discouragement, which comes from having a limited perspective on his situation.\n\n
39:1	idm64841					*title* **Jeduthun** was a levitical singer appointed by David along with Asaph (*1 Chr 9:16*; *16:38*; *25:1*).\n\n
39:1	idm64852					 Suffering in **silence** only intensifies the psalmist’s anguish, pain, and inner **turmoil**.\n\n
39:4	idm64860					 Because of his suffering and sin, the psalmist concludes that life is meaningless and fleeting (see *Job 7:7-10*; *Isa 40:6-8*). He had expected a wicked life to have those qualities (see *Pss 37:2*, *20*; *103:15-16*), but now whether a person is godly or not seems to be irrelevant.\n\n
39:4	idm64871					 **how fleeting my life is:** This perspective comes out of suffering (see *78:39*; *89:47-48*; *90:3-10*). The human **lifetime** is but a **moment** to God (*90:4*), as temporary as a **breath** (see *39:11*; *144:4*).\n\n
39:8	idm64887					 The idea that **rebellion** brings on suffering is a common thread in *Pss 32*, *38–41*.\n\n
39:9	idm64896					 The psalmist links suffering with God’s **discipline**, assuming that it is **punishment** for his sin.\n\n
39:11	idm64904					 The Lord uses **discipline** to correct his children (*38:1*, *3*, *7*; *40:12*; see *Prov 3:11-12*; *Heb 12:5-6*).\n\n
39:12	idm64917					 A **guest** (or *foreigner*) had no rights of land ownership (see *Lev 25:23*). The patriarchs had lived as guests in Canaan (*Ps 105:23*).\n\n
39:13	idm64927					 Unlike the psalmist’s earlier request that God stay close to him (*38:21-22*), his present desire for God to **leave** him **alone** echoes Job’s disposition (*Job 7:17-19*).\n\n
40:1	idm64937					 This psalm includes a thanksgiving song (*40:1-10*) followed by a lament (*40:11-17*). The thanksgiving song includes the reason for the thanksgiving (*40:1-5*), an affirmation of commitment (*40:6-8*), and a public testimony of God’s character (*40:7-10*). The lament concerns the psalmist’s troubles because of his sins (*40:11-12*) and is followed by two prayers for vindication (*40:13-15*, *17*).\n\n
40:1	idm64951					 The psalmist thanks the Lord for his rescue and testifies that God can be trusted.\n\n
40:6	idm64957					 The Lord delights in the attitude and character of the person making an offering more than in the offering itself. • **Now that you have made me listen, I finally understand:** Greek text reads *You have given me a body.* In *Heb 10:5-7*, the writer quotes from the Greek version of *Ps 40:6-8*. He casts the words as something Jesus said as he left heaven and came into the world.\n\n
40:7	idm64967					 **As is written about me in the Scriptures:** Moses had recorded God’s requirements for Israel’s kings in *Deut 17:14-15*.\n\n
40:11	idm64975					 The psalmist prays that the Lord will be true to his character when answering this plea for mercy.\n\n
40:12	idm64981					 The psalmist is troubled by both his adversities and his own **sins** and prays for rescue. • This passage is repeated almost verbatim as *Ps 70*.\n\n
41:1	idm64989					 In this wisdom psalm, the psalmist prays for healing (*41:4*, *10*), laments his distress (*41:5-9*), and expresses confidence in the Lord’s blessing (*41:1-3*, *11-12*).\n\n
41:1	idm65000					 The **poor** who suffer hardship have special protection under God’s law (*Lev 14:21*; *19:10*); they receive God’s justice and godly rule (*Pss 72:13*; *82:3-4*). The word translated *poor* is often a synonym for the godly (*113:7*; see *Zeph 3:12*).\n\n
41:3	idm65014					 **when they are sick:** This illness might be physical or spiritual (see *6:2*; *Ps 38*).\n\n
41:4	idm65023					 The psalmist applies the blessing to himself (*41:12*). Apparently he has taken care of the poor (*41:1*), but he has sinned against the Lord in other ways. Out of his pain, he cries for healing while confessing his sin. The Lord alone can grant the restoration that brings true joy (*30:2*; *107:20-21*).\n\n
41:5	idm65033					 The psalmist’s enemies disguise themselves as friends, while his friends openly become his enemies.\n\n
41:5	idm65039					 **How soon will he die?** The psalmist’s opponents regard his suffering as a divine judgment (cp. *1:6*).\n\n
41:9	idm65047					 **the one who shared my food:** Eating together was a sign of unity (*Acts 2:42*). Refusing to eat with someone indicated hostility (*1 Cor 5:11*). Jesus experienced the same kind of betrayal (*John 13:1*, *18*).\n\n
41:11	idm65058					 The psalmist knows that the Lord has forgiven him and will bless him.\n\n
41:13	idm65064					 This doxology closes Book One (*Pss 1–41*). Cp. *106:48*.\n\n
42:1	idm65072					 These psalms, like *Pss 9* and *10*, form a unit comprising a lament with a bittersweet refrain of hope (*42:5*, *11*; *43:5*). In many Hebrew manuscripts these two psalms are combined as one. The historical context is uncertain; these psalms might be the voice of God’s people in exile, confessing their loyalty to God as he punishes them for their prevailing apostasy. The psalmist longs for fellowship with God such as he enjoyed in Jerusalem (*42:4*); his memories only make him more discouraged. As the psalmist cries out to God, he recalls God’s love and faithfulness (*42:8*), which moves him to plead for vindication (*43:1-4*).\n\n
42:1	idm65086					*title* **The descendants of Korah** were members of a Levitical choir appointed by David to serve as Temple singers (see *1 Chr 6:22-38*; *9:19-34*; *2 Chr 20:19*). Their ancestor Korah was the apostate who had rebelled against Moses and whom the earth swallowed up (*Exod 6:24*; *Num 16*).\n\n
42:1	idm65099					 The psalmist’s longing for God comes from being geographically distant from the Temple as he remembers the past. • The verb translated **longs** is found only here and in *Joel 1:20* (“cry out”); in both cases it refers to extreme **thirst** in a waterless desert (see *Pss 63:1*; *143:6*; see also *84:2*).\n\n
42:3	idm65111					 Having **tears for food** speaks of great grief (*80:5*; *102:9*; see *6:6*; *56:8*; *119:136*; *126:5*). • The wicked try to hold God to their timetable and deny his power to intervene.\n\n
42:4	idm65124					 The psalmist recalls **leading a great procession** as a member of the Levitical choir, possibly during the high holy days.\n\n
42:5	idm65131					 The psalmist encourages himself with questions and answers.\n\n
42:5	idm65137					 The psalmist feels depressed, but it does not incapacitate him. He remembers that the living God is his **Savior**. This verse is repeated in *42:11* and *43:5*.\n\n
42:6	idm65146					 **Mount Hermon** is a high mountain range northeast of Israel. The **source of the Jordan** is by Dan at the foot of Mount Hermon. • **Mount Mizar** might be a peak in the Mount Hermon range.\n\n
42:7	idm65155					 The **raging seas***,* **waves***,* and **surging tides** conjure images of God’s wrath (see *88:7*).\n\n
42:8	idm65167					 The psalmist sees rays of hope. A life oriented to God includes **songs** of joy and **praying** for justice and vindication (*42:9-10*; *43:1-4*).\n\n
42:9	idm65177					 The psalmist brings his many doubts, discouragements, and questions directly to God.\n\n
43:1	idm65183					 The psalmist turns to the Lord for rescue from his troubles, for guidance, for restoration, and for vindication.\n\n
43:2	idm65189					 **tossed me aside:** Other psalms similarly ask whether God has rejected his people (*44:9*, *23*; *60:1*, *10*; *74:1*; *77:7*; *88:14*; *89:38*; *108:11*).\n\n
43:3	idm65205					 In this prayer for God’s redemption, **light** and **truth** are viewed as guides (see *18:25-29*; *27:1*; *85:10-13*; *89:14-18*; see also *119:105*; *John 3:19*; *Eph 5:8*; *1 Thes 5:5-7*). • The Temple on the **mountain** in Jerusalem symbolized God’s **holy** presence among his people (*Pss 15:1*; *43:3*; *99:5*, *9*; *132:7*).\n\n
43:5	idm65228					 This verse is repeated in *42:5*, *11*.\n\n
44:1	idm65236					 This national lament after defeat in battle continues the tone of the previous two psalms, including reflecting on an unspecified moment in Israel’s history and calling on God for salvation. The people recite God’s past acts of rescue (*44:1-3*), acknowledge God’s power to save (*44:4-8*), describe their humiliation in exile (*44:9-16*), claim their innocence and lament the injustice of their current situation (*44:17-22*), and cry for vindication (*44:23-26*).\n\n
44:1	idm65247					 **we have heard . . . of all you did:** The story of redemption encompasses the story of God’s favor and power in his past acts of rescue (see *78:1-4*; see also *Pss 105–106*).\n\n
44:2	idm65256					 God **drove out the pagan nations** during the conquests recorded in Joshua.\n\n
44:3	idm65263					 Though the Israelites used **swords** and other weapons (*44:6*), they would have lost their battles without the **light** of the Lord’s favor (see *18:25-29*; *27:1*; *89:15*).\n\n
44:4	idm65275					 God’s people feel confident about his mighty acts; he was with them in the past, and he is their king in the present.\n\n
44:9	idm65281					 The people have experienced defeat (*44:9-12*), so they understand suffering and disgrace (*44:13-16*).\n\n
44:11	idm65289					 **scattered us among the nations:** This probably refers to the Exile (see *51:18-19*; *89:38-51*; *106:40-47*; *137*).\n\n
44:22	idm65300					 Paul quotes this verse as a parenthetical aside in his list of things that cannot separate us from Christ’s love (*Rom 8:36*).\n\n
44:23	idm65307					 In the end, God’s people can turn to the Lord and trust him for rescue. Their petition for God to remedy their situation is as strong as their lament about God’s rejection.\n\n
44:23	idm65313					 **Wake up:** Biblical authors often call for God’s attention in a crisis (*35:23*; *44:23*; *73:20*; *80:2*; *Mark 4:38*).\n\n
45:1	idm65325					 This psalm celebrates a royal wedding; it might have been sung on many occasions and not just at one wedding. As God’s representative, the king carried the responsibility of dispensing justice and maintaining order in God’s world (see *Ps 2*).\n\n
45:1	idm65332					*title* The **tune “Lilies”** is no longer known (see also *Ps 69*).\n\n
45:2	idm65341					 This general description of the king’s symbolic status anticipates his permanent legacy (*45:16*). That the Lord has **blessed** him and charged him to bear God’s attributes is symbolized by his **handsome** appearance and **gracious words**.\n\n
45:3	idm65351					 The psalmist expounds on the royal splendor the king showed when fighting his enemies.\n\n
45:3	idm65357					 Glory and majesty belong to the Lord (*96:6*; *111:3*).\n\n
45:4	idm65365					 As God’s agent of **truth, humility, and justice** (see *72:1-2*, *4*, *7*), the king can carry out **awe-inspiring deeds** (*65:5*; *96:4*).\n\n
45:6	idm65378					 The king is like a god among humans; he is anointed by God, he has received a mighty throne, and he dispenses justice as he rules forever. • The writer to the Hebrews applies *45:6-7* to Jesus as he argues that the Son is greater than the angels (*Heb 1:8-9*).\n\n
45:6	idm65386					 **Justice** characterizes God’s **rule***,* as it should characterize the king’s administration.\n\n
45:8	idm65395					 Fine spices mixed with oil create distinctive perfumes. • The king’s **palaces** were wood paneled with ivory inlays (cp. *6:4*; *Amos 3:15*).\n\n
45:9	idm65404					 Marriages often sealed diplomatic connections between kings; the **women** became part of the harem (see *1 Kgs 11:1-3*).\n\n
45:10	idm65412					 The bride is a representative of the king. Powerful people and nations try to gain her favor in order to get close to the king. This is a great honor, and she is encouraged to give herself fully to her new position.\n\n
45:12	idm65418					 **The princess of Tyre:** Israel traded with Tyre, a powerful city-state. The noblest woman of the city bears a wedding gift to her counterpart, the new queen, who represents an honored kingdom.\n\n
46:1	idm65425					 This psalm of Zion celebrates God’s special presence in Jerusalem (see also *Pss 48*, *76*, *87*, *122*), inviting confidence in the Lord because the citizens of Zion enjoy his protection.\n\n
46:1	idm65435					*title* **sung by soprano voices:** Hebrew *according to alamoth* (“maidens”; see also *study note on 1 Chr 15:20*). In worship, a choir or a group of instrumentalists performed this hymn.\n\n
46:1	idm65445					 Even when faced with natural disasters, the citizens of Zion express no fear.\n\n
46:4	idm65451					 The strong city where **God dwells** protects its inhabitants. They enjoy the **river** flowing inside the city. This river contrasts with the turbulent waters (the powers of the nations) outside the city.\n\n
46:4	idm65459					 Like the streams flowing through Eden, this **river** brings the water of life, restoration, and healing (*36:8-9*; see *Gen 2:10*; *Ezek 47*; *Rev 22:2*).\n\n
46:5	idm65470					 **From the very break of day:** In the ancient Near East, enemies attacked cities during the day; even during the most dangerous times, the Lord **will protect** the place where his name dwells.\n\n
46:6	idm65478					 People and **nations** live **in chaos***,* characterized by opportunism (*83:2*), busyness (*39:6*), and noise. These people shake, totter, and **crumble***,* unlike the city of God (cp. *15:5*). In contrast, when the godly feel disturbed, they cry out for God’s help (*42:5*, *11*; *43:5*; *55:17*).\n\n
46:7	idm65496					 This refrain reminds readers of the identity of the God of Zion. • **among us:** Hebrew *‘immanu**,* part of the name Immanuel, “God with us” (*Isa 7:14*; *8:8*; *Matt 1:23*).\n\n
46:8	idm65508					 This invitation to trust in the Lord offers a perspective on God’s interactions with human powers.\n\n
46:8	idm65514					 Israel saw the Lord’s **glorious works** in the wilderness (*107:24*; *111:2*), but the wicked, who have no concern for them (*28:5*), are left desolate (*73:19*).\n\n
46:10	idm65525					 A message directly from the Lord confirms the authenticity of the psalmist’s vision (see also *12:5-6*; *32:8*). • **know that I am God:** The Lord will do what he promises (*Isa 45:3*; *49:23*; *60:16*). • God will be exalted (*Ps 47*; *Isa 6:1*); he will judge the nations and rescue his people (see *Pss 57:11*; *89:13*; *108:5-6*; *118:16*).\n\n
47:1	idm65543					 This psalm celebrates God’s kingship over all the earth; it tells of God’s victory in dealing with Israel and the nations. Both Israel (*47:3-4*) and the nations (*47:9*) participate in God’s kingdom.\n\n
47:1	idm65551					 As the sovereign king over the nations, God requires praise.\n\n
47:1	idm65557					 People **clap** their **hands** in praise and recognition of marvelous deeds (*47:3-4*; see *98:8*; *Isa 55:12*; cp. *Nah 3:19*).\n\n
47:3	idm65569					 The Lord made Israel victorious, especially under David (see *18:40-50*). God’s mighty deeds of redemption manifest his love for Israel.\n\n
47:4	idm65576					 **Jacob’s descendants:** Jacob was the father of all Israelites (*Gen 32:28*); the name Jacob often represents the nation of Israel. • God **loves** and commits himself to Jacob (see *Pss 78:68*; *127:2*; see *Rom 11:28*).\n\n
47:5	idm65588					 The psalmist portrays the Lord as returning to heaven, having accomplished his victories. For a portrayal of his descent, see *18:9-16*.\n\n
47:5	idm65595					 **trumpets:** Or *rams’ horns* (see *81:3*). At times, rams’ horns were sounded in celebration (*98:5-6*; *2 Kgs 11:14*; *1 Chr 15:28*).\n\n
47:7	idm65607					 People from **all the earth** (see *96:1-3*) will worship God.\n\n
48:1	idm65615					 This song of Zion (see also *Pss 46*, *76*, *87*, *122*) explicitly views Jerusalem (Zion) as the city of the Great King where the godly find protection (*48:1-3*). God rules from Zion in faithfulness, righteousness, and justice, and he inspires his subjects with confidence and joy (*48:9-11*). They commit themselves to seeing the glory of Zion for themselves so that they can tell the next generation about it (*48:8*, *12-14*).\n\n
48:3	idm65629					 God dwells in Zion to protect it from all enemies (see *46:5*).\n\n
48:7	idm65636					 The **ships of Tarshish***,* built for long voyages, represent human accomplishment (see also *2 Chr 9:21*; *Isa 2:16*). Their destruction might be the event mentioned in *1 Kgs 22:48*.\n\n
48:9	idm65647					 The psalmist joyfully celebrates the Lord’s presence in the midst of the community, reflecting on the faithfulness, righteousness, and justice of God’s rule.\n\n
48:12	idm65653					 **towers . . . fortified walls . . . citadels:** These structures provide a visual tour of Zion’s strength.\n\n
48:14	idm65660					 No one is like God (*35:10*; *71:19*; *86:8*; *89:6*, *8*; *113:5*; see *Isa 40:18*, *25*). He is the shepherd King (*Ps 95:7*) who **will guide** (see *5:8*; *23:2*) the sheep of his flock (*77:20*).\n\n
49:1	idm65679					 In this wisdom psalm, a wise teacher warns against enemies, whom he portrays as living a rich lifestyle and caring only for themselves (*49:5-9*). They cannot keep anyone alive, least of all themselves, even in their memories (*49:10-12*). Like fattened animals, they are led to slaughter (*49:14-20*).\n\n
49:1	idm65688					 The wisdom teacher invites everyone to the hall of wisdom; he promises to instruct with a proverb and a riddle.\n\n
49:1	idm65694					 Anyone who will **listen** can gain wisdom (*Prov 1:5*, *8*, *33*).\n\n
49:4	idm65704					 The teacher used both **proverbs** and **riddles** for instruction in wisdom (see *Prov 1:5-6*).\n\n
49:5	idm65713					 If enemies who live for material rewards cannot sustain themselves, how can they give life to others?\n\n
49:11	idm65719					 The teacher brings wisdom through irony. Everyone dies, and even those with **estates** named after them will be forgotten.\n\n
49:13	idm65726					 The teachers of false wisdom cannot rescue themselves from death. Only God has that power.\n\n
49:16	idm65732					 The **wicked** might have rich, luxurious lives, but they forget that they cannot avoid death.\n\n
50:1	idm65739					 God appears as judge to remind the godly and the ungodly in turn that outward performance of sacrificial rituals and recitation of the law are worthless without thankfulness, repentance, and justice.\n\n
50:1	idm65745					 The whole universe must pay attention when **God approaches** to bring justice into the world.\n\n
50:4	idm65752					 The Lord is coming to bring righteousness. This hope encourages his **faithful people***,* but those who have been unfaithful will not experience blessing when **the heavens above and earth below** testify against them (cp. *Deut 30:19*; *31:28*; *32:1*; *Isa 1:2*). The Lord comes to restore order to the world (*Pss 5:8*; *22:31*; *33:5*; *40:9*; *50:6*; *71:16*; *97:6*).\n\n
50:7	idm65772					 The psalmist delivers a message against those who regard the sacrificial rituals as more important than having a proper heart attitude.\n\n
50:9	idm65778					 Unlike pagan gods, God does **not need** food; instead, he wants his people to serve him with a right heart (*50:14-15*).\n\n
50:10	idm65786					 **I own the cattle on a thousand hills:** God has no needs; he possesses everything.\n\n
50:14	idm65793					 **Thankfulness** means looking beyond self-interest to express gratitude for God’s blessings (see *51:15-17*; *54:6*). • True **sacrifice** requires offering one’s self to the glory of God (*50:23*; *Rom 12:1-2*).\n\n
50:15	idm65805					 God’s response to his people’s cry is to **rescue** them.\n\n
50:16	idm65812					 This message is against the wicked, who only pretend to listen to God.\n\n
50:17	idm65818					 **my discipline . . . my words:** The wicked may observe rituals, but they reject more important matters such as justice, mercy, and faithfulness (cp. *Matt 23:23-24*).\n\n
50:21	idm65826					 Because he is patient, God **remained silent**.\n\n
50:22	idm65833					 The wicked will experience God’s justice, while the godly will see God’s everlasting salvation.\n\n
50:22	idm65839					 God **will tear** the wicked **apart** like a lion tearing its prey (*Isa 5:29*; *31:4*; *Ezek 19:3*; cp. *Pss 7:2*; *22:13*).\n\n
51:1	idm65852					 These psalms of David share a common thread in their reflection on the experience of evil. In *Ps 51*, the psalmist confesses the evil he has done and asks God’s forgiveness. *Psalms 52–64* lament specific evils that David experienced. A song of praise (*Ps 65*) brings David’s laments to an end.\n\n
51:1	idm65861					 This moving prayer for restoration asks for God’s favor, mercy, forgiveness, and cleansing. Out of a broken spirit, the psalmist confesses and accepts responsibility for his sin (*51:3-6*), then petitions God to remove his guilt and renew him inwardly (*51:7-12*). The psalmist then recommits himself to a lifestyle of wisdom and joy in the service of God and others (*51:13-17*).\n\n
51:1	idm65870					*title* **regarding the time Nathan . . . Bathsheba:** See *2 Sam 11:1-27*. The text of the psalm contains no explicit reference to this event.\n\n
51:1	idm65879					 The repentant offender has nothing to offer God. He needs God’s favor, mercy, forgiveness, and blessing before he can experience renewal and restoration.\n\n
51:1	idm65885					 A prayer for God’s **mercy** and kindness is part of the genre of lament. Sometimes the plea comes from the psalmist’s acknowledgment of his weakness and sin, as here (see also *6:2*; *9:13*; *25:16*; *31:9*; *41:4*, *10*). At other times, it arises from the psalmist’s commitment to the Lord (see *26:11*; *27:7*; *119:29*, *58*, *132*). In each case, God’s mercy brings an inner renewal.\n\n
51:2	idm65903					 **Wash me . . . Purify me:** The psalmist prays for cleansing and release from the **guilt** of his sin (*51:7*; see *26:6*; *Isa 1:16*, *18*; *4:4*).\n\n
51:3	idm65916					 The psalmist accepts the consequences of his sin against God. He knows that there is nothing good in him unless God renews his life.\n\n
51:4	idm65922					 **Against . . . you alone:** This is hyperbole—the psalmist knows he also **sinned** against human beings (*2 Sam 11:2-4*, *15-17*), but his offense against God is more important. He expects God to rebuke him and will accept whatever verdict God renders (see *Rom 3:4*).\n\n
51:5	idm65933					 **I was born a sinner:** The psalmist is not making excuses but is acknowledging the depth of his sinfulness. From the time we are **conceived***,* we all share in the human condition of sinfulness.\n\n
51:7	idm65942					 **Purify me from my sins** (literally *Purify me with the hyssop branch*; see *Exod 12:22*; *Lev 14:4*; *John 19:29*; *Heb 9:19*): The psalmist depends on God to purify and renew him (see *Isa 1:18*).\n\n
51:8	idm65955					 Regaining **joy** is a gracious gift from God. • **you have broken me:** The psalmist’s whole being feels broken (*6:2*; cp. *34:20*).\n\n
51:10	idm65965					 God’s Spirit renews and recreates the human spirit.\n\n
51:10	idm65971					 **A loyal spirit** yields the inner qualities of constancy and perseverance.\n\n
51:11	idm65978					 **your Holy Spirit:** Only the power of the Holy Spirit can change the human will to make it “loyal” (*51:10*) and “willing to obey” (*51:12*).\n\n
51:13	idm65987					 As he learns from his sin and its consequences, the psalmist wants to **teach** others.\n\n
51:14	idm65994					 **shedding blood:** This idiom includes any injustice, not just homicide (*9:12*; *58:10*; see *2 Sam 11:14-26*; cp. *Isa 1:15-17*).\n\n
51:18	idm66005					 **rebuild the walls of Jerusalem:** These verses were probably added as a prayer for national restoration after the Exile (see *Pss 42–43*); the entire community in exile identified with the spirit of the psalm.\n\n
51:19	idm66013					 **Sacrifices offered in the right spirit** come from a heart that is right with God and with others (see *15:2-5*; *24:3-6*; *50:14*; *Matt 5:23-24*).\n\n
52:1	idm66024					 Wicked people use words to destroy relationships and communities. They foolishly think that they can be heroes by their words (*52:1-4*), but their fate suddenly overtakes them (*52:5-7*). In contrast, the godly renew their commitment to the Lord (*52:8-9*) and find their future secure in him.\n\n
52:1	idm66033					*title* This psalm refers to an incident in *1 Sam 21:1-10*; *22:9-10*. The accuser, **Doeg the Edomite***,* is a paradigm of evil.\n\n
52:1	idm66044					 Liars foolishly deceive themselves by thinking that they can be heroes by their words. They believe themselves innocent of any charges of evildoing, though they love evil and cause destruction. Those who speak curses, sarcasm, bitterness, arrogant boasting, and deceptions (*31:18*; *34:13*; *59:7*, *12*; *120:2-3*; *140:3*, *9*) bring about chaos, alienation, and destruction (*Jas 3:5*). Their sharp words cut like swords and daggers (*Pss 55:21*; *57:4*; *64:3*), the fangs of a snake (*140:3*), or a **razor.**\n\n
52:3	idm66063					 Deceptive speech changes one’s character.\n\n
52:5	idm66069					 God’s judgment on the wicked will come suddenly and forcibly. The godly rejoice in God’s justice, not in the misfortunes of the wicked.\n\n
52:5	idm66075					 God **will strike** the wicked **down **like a pagan altar, idol, or unclean vessel (*Exod 34:13*; *Lev 11:35*; *2 Kgs 10:27*).\n\n
52:6	idm66086					 In Hebrew, the verbs here translated **see** and **be amazed** sound almost alike.\n\n
52:8	idm66094					 The psalmist commits himself to a life of trust in the Lord. • An **olive tree** lives a long time when cared for (*1:3*; *128:3*). The psalmist desires to be close to the Lord, his Savior and the source of his blessing (*18:6*; *23:6*).\n\n
53:1	idm66105					 This psalm parallels *Ps 14*, differing only in verse 5.\n\n
53:1	idm66112					 Paul uses the Greek translation of this passage in his description of the depravity of all people (*Rom 3:10-12*).\n\n
53:5	idm66119					 **scatter the bones:** Israel’s **enemies** would suffer shameful defeat and lack the peaceful rest of a decent burial (cp. *141:7*; *2 Kgs 9:10*; *Jer 8:1-2*; *Ezek 6:5*).\n\n
54:1	idm66131					 In this individual lament, occasioned by violent and godless people (*54:3*), the psalmist turns to God in prayer and maintains his focus on God’s help (*54:4*). He prays for God to save him from evil and to judge his enemies (*54:5*, *7*).\n\n
54:1	idm66141					*title* This psalm refers to the account of *1 Sam 23:19-20*, when the **Ziphites** were bent on violence.\n\n
54:3	idm66150					 The **strangers** were alienated from the covenant community (see *109:11*; *Prov 5:10*). • Proud and **violent people** hold no regard for God or for other people (see *Pss 35:11*, *25*; *86:14*; *Prov 11:16*).\n\n
54:6	idm66164					 In anticipation of God’s response, the mood of the psalm changes from gloom to thanksgiving.\n\n
54:6	idm66170					 A **voluntary offering** is a sacrifice of praise. Sacrifices of praise are the kind of offering God most desires (see *Ps 50:14-15*, *23*).\n\n
55:1	idm66179					 The psalmist is faced with adversaries whose leader is a former friend (*55:12-14*), and he is overwhelmed with anguish. He turns to the Lord in prayer and commits himself to the Lord for redress (*55:22-23*). Jesus experienced similar suffering when his friend (Judas) betrayed him. He also experienced the answer to the psalmist’s prayer: (1) by taking the place of the wicked and receiving their judgment (*Isa 53:7-9*), and (2) by committing himself to the Father, who rescued (*Luke 23:46*) and rewarded him (*Isa 53:10-12*).\n\n
55:1	idm66190					 The occasion for this prayer is an attack by an enemy.\n\n
55:4	idm66196					 In the experience of deep anguish, the psalmist confesses that his adversity has become unbearable and he seeks an escape.\n\n
55:12	idm66202					 The psalmist’s enemy was once a **friend**; memories of that close relationship bring him pain (see *31:11*).\n\n
55:19	idm66210					 God is good and faithful, but the psalmist’s enemies and so-called friend are deceitful and wicked.\n\n
55:22	idm66216					 The psalmist commits all his cares **to the** Lord.\n\n
55:23	idm66224					 To **die young** means that one fails to experience God’s full blessing (cp. *Prov 3:2*, *16*).\n\n
56:1	idm66233					 This individual lament moves from petition to confidence two times (*56:1-4*, *5-13*).\n\n
56:1	idm66241					*title* David was **seized** by **Philistines** concerned about his loyalties and brought before King Achish (*1 Sam 21:10-15*).\n\n
56:4	idm66251					 **mere mortals:** Or *mere flesh,* in contrast to the immortal and infinitely more powerful God (see *Isa 2:22*).\n\n
56:5	idm66260					 The psalmist specifies his charge against his attackers as he prays for their evil to cease.\n\n
56:8	idm66266					 The psalmist makes a play on the Hebrew words translated **sorrows** (Hebrew *nod*) and **bottle** (Hebrew *no’d*).\n\n
56:11	idm66276					 **mere mortals** (Hebrew *’adam*)**:** The psalm also uses two other words for man: *’enosh* (“people,” *56:1*) and *basar* (“mere mortals,” *56:4*). All express the ideas of mortality and finitude.\n\n
56:13	idm66289					 The **light** of God’s goodness and salvation will replace the darkness of **death** (see *18:25-29*; *27:1*).\n\n
57:1	idm66299					 The psalmist’s cry for mercy and protection quickly turns into an affirmation of trust and confidence in the Lord (*57:1-4*). When the wicked fall into their own traps (*57:6*), the psalmist will praise the Lord (*57:7-10*).\n\n
57:1	idm66308					*title* **David . . . fled from Saul and went into the cave:** See *1 Sam 22:1* or *Ps 24:1-8*.\n\n
57:1	idm66318					 **shadow of your wings:** As a bird protects its young, God protects the one who trusts in him (see *17:8*).\n\n
57:2	idm66326					 **God Most High** (Hebrew *Elohim-Elyon*) is a generic title for God, who is more powerful than all real or imagined supernatural beings (see *91:1*; *97:9*; *Gen 14:18-22*). • **who will fulfill his purpose:** Or *who will end my [trouble],* or *who deals kindly with me*.\n\n
57:3	idm66340					 These verses are a prayer for rescue from powerful enemies. The metaphor of **fierce lions** describes human enemies; the psalmist feels unable to escape them without God’s intervention (see also *35:11-21*; *124:6*).\n\n
57:5	idm66349					 This verse is repeated in *57:11* and *108:5*. • God’s **glory**—his manifest presence that excludes all evil (*8:1*; *19:1-4*; *24:7*)—will fill the whole created order (*Isa 6:3*).\n\n
57:7	idm66362					 This section is repeated with a few modifications in *108:1-5*.\n\n
57:7	idm66369					 The psalmist is **confident** that God will end the night of evil (cp. *56:13*).\n\n
57:10	idm66377					 God’s glory extends to the whole universe, as will praise for his **unfailing love** and **faithfulness**.\n\n
58:1	idm66385					 The administration of justice is a mark of good government. God expects nothing less from his people. The psalmist condemns Israel’s leaders for abusing their power, and he calls on the Lord to rain down his curses upon the wicked. The demonstration of divine justice will reassure the godly that God is just.\n\n
58:1	idm66391					 The administrators of justice were furthering their own interests rather than those of the needy. The absence of justice gradually resulted in a violent society.\n\n
58:1	idm66397					 **rulers** (or *gods*): This designation was used for high officials and administrators of **justice** (*82:1*, *6*). Elsewhere, it might refer to angelic creatures (*89:7*) or to the gods of the nations (*82:1*; *Dan 11:36*).\n\n
58:3	idm66411					 All human beings are **born sinners** (see *51:5*); however, whereas the **wicked** indulge their sinful nature, the godly fight against it (*Rom 7:19-23*; *Jas 4:1-10*).\n\n
58:4	idm66422					 **Venom** here means poisonous speech (see *140:3*).\n\n
58:6	idm66430					 The psalmist calls on God to **break** the destructive power of the wicked.\n\n
58:8	idm66437					 When moving over dry ground, **snails** dry up.\n\n
58:9	idm66444					 God’s judgment will come suddenly. The certainty of vindication brings joy to the godly.\n\n
58:11	idm66450					 Vindication is the reward of **those who live for God**.\n\n
59:1	idm66457					 The psalmist laments the power of enemies who conspire with other nations.\n\n
59:1	idm66463					*title* **the time Saul sent soldiers to watch David’s house:** See *1 Sam 19:11-18*.\n\n
59:1	idm66472					 **Protect me** (or *place me on* *high*): When surrounded by evil, the godly pray for God to set them apart for himself and protect them.\n\n
59:4	idm66481					 The psalmist asks God to show the treacherous, deceptive, and **wicked traitors** no mercy (see *25:2*).\n\n
59:6	idm66489					 The wicked threaten like **vicious dogs***,* but the Lord responds with scorn.\n\n
59:11	idm66497					 The psalmist prays that the wicked will be forced to endure the same agonizing pain they have caused.\n\n
59:14	idm66503					 The wicked will go **unsatisfied***,* but the psalmist will praise the Lord’s **power** and **unfailing love**.\n\n
60:1	idm66513					 The psalmist laments a national defeat and cries out to God for rescue.\n\n
60:1	idm66519					*title* **useful for teaching:** This psalm was taught to young people as part of their education. • **regarding the time:** See *2 Sam 8:13-14*. • **Aram-naharaim** and **Aram-zobah** refer to the Arameans of northwest Mesopotamia and Syria (see *study note on Gen 24:10*). • The **tune “Lily of the Testimony”** is unknown today.\n\n
60:1	idm66533					 When God’s people experience his discipline, they affirm their loyalty and await God’s answer.\n\n
60:3	idm66539					 **wine** (Hebrew *yayin*) **that sent us reeling:** *Yayin,* the generic Hebrew term meaning “wine,” is often associated with drunkenness (*2 Sam 13:28*; *Isa 5:11*; *28:7-8*; cp. *Ps 104:15*; *Deut 14:26*; *Isa 55:1*); it symbolized God’s judgment of the wicked (*Ps 75:8*; *Jer 51:7*).\n\n
60:4	idm66557					 God **raised a banner** over his people to serve as **a rallying point** and as a source of pride and confidence. • The **fear** of God that leads to wisdom (*111:10*) is not weakness; it provides the perspective and strength required to do what is right.\n\n
60:5	idm66567					 This section is repeated verbatim in *108:6-13*.\n\n
60:5	idm66574					 The psalmist prays for rescue based on the special relationship between God and his people.\n\n
60:6	idm66580					 The Lord responds with a message of promise. He shares his land with his people as spoils of war.\n\n
60:6	idm66586					 **Shechem** and **Succoth** represent Israel’s heartland.\n\n
60:9	idm66594					 Destroying a defeated invader’s capital (**the fortified city**) would help to ensure that they would not attack again. The capital of **Edom** was Bozrah, located to the southeast of Israel. Only God could grant **victory.**\n\n
61:1	idm66603					 In these royal prayers, the psalmist longs for God’s presence. All three psalms concern themselves with the king’s security.\n\n
61:1	idm66609					 The lamenting psalmist petitions God to protect him and lead him into his presence (*61:4-5*). He prays for God to extend and protect the king’s rule and makes vows to praise God.\n\n
61:2	idm66616					 **the ends of the earth:** This expression has the connotation of a cry that comes from a place far away from God. • The psalmist’s **heart is overwhelmed** with deep anguish.\n\n
61:4	idm66624					 The poet longs for God’s presence and seeks entrance into God’s home on earth for divine protection and care. To be received into God’s **sanctuary** (literally *tent*) is the greatest good (see *15:1*; *23:6*; *24:3-6*). The Hebrew word translated *sanctuary* recalls the Tabernacle and the tent that David built for the Ark (*1 Chr 15:1*). See also *study note on John 1:14*. • The **shelter of your wings** symbolizes God’s protection and care (see *Pss 9:9*; *17:8*).\n\n
61:5	idm66641					 **you have heard my vows:** The psalmist’s vows might also be a part of ceremonial sacrifices (*66:13-15*; *76:11*; *116:14*, *18*). He praises and thanks God for his rescue. • The **inheritance** refers to the promise of the land (see *Ps 60*), the sacredness of the Temple, the joy of God’s presence (*119:111*), or any similar reward (*16:6*; *37:9*, *11*, *18*, *22*, *29*, *34*; *127:3*).\n\n
62:1	idm66663					 This psalm expresses confidence in the king and offers prayer for him. The king rests in God despite his difficulties. Although his deceptive and powerful adversaries push hard against him, he remains undaunted. He encourages himself and his people to trust in God and to see their human adversaries from God’s perspective, where they appear frail, fleeting, and deceptive (*62:9*).\n\n
62:1	idm66670					*title* **Jeduthun:** See *1 Chr 25:1*; also in *Pss 39* and *77*.\n\n
62:3	idm66681					 The enemies desire to topple the king with lies and cunning.\n\n
62:4	idm66687					 **My high position** refers to the royal throne.\n\n
62:5	idm66694					 The psalmist encourages himself and others to place their hope in God.\n\n
62:9	idm66700					 Unlike God, humans are transient beings. Even when they thrive, their prosperity is fleeting.\n\n
62:9	idm66706					 **not what they appear to be:** People often try to look stronger and better than they are.\n\n
62:10	idm66713					 The crime of **extortion** means using intimidation and threats to make others give up what is theirs, while **stealing** is taking what belongs to others.\n\n
62:11	idm66721					 Strength and **unfailing love** remain in balance only in God. He cares for his people by ridding the world of evildoers (see *1:6*).\n\n
63:1	idm66729					 The king longs for God’s presence so vividly that he eats, drinks, and sees God’s goodness. Though worn out and harassed by the wicked, the king sees God, and this animates him with praise. God becomes his life (*63:3*), while the wicked perish (*63:9*).\n\n
63:1	idm66737					 Together, **soul** and **whole body** refer to a person’s entire being. • **parched and weary land:** When David was living in the desert, he also found himself in a spiritual wasteland, separated from God’s people and the sanctuary.\n\n
63:2	idm66746					 The psalmist remembers that he had found God to be present in his **sanctuary** (see *18:6*; *61:4*; *62:5*, *11-12*).\n\n
63:3	idm66757					 **better than life itself:** The highest quality of life is found in relationship with God (see *4:7*; *63:5*; *Prov 16:8*).\n\n
63:6	idm66767					 The psalmist reflects and meditates on God’s presence **through the night**. In the absence of light, God is the light. The quietness of the night and the longing for dawn provide time to focus on the true significance of life with the Lord.\n\n
63:6	idm66774					 **Meditating** on God requires focused awareness, concentration, thought, and reflection (see *1:2*).\n\n
63:9	idm66782					 The wicked were **plotting to destroy** the psalmist’s life through deception and lies, but they would meet their end. • The **depths of the earth** refers to the place of the dead.\n\n
63:10	idm66790					 Wild **jackals** are associated with desolation and abandonment (*Isa 13:20-22*; *34:10-15*; *Jer 9:11*; *49:33*; *51:37*; *Lam 5:18*; *Mal 1:3*). The wicked will not receive honor in death; their bodies will be left to scavenging animals (*Eccl 6:3*; *Jer 22:18-19*; *36:29-30*).\n\n
64:1	idm66807					 This lament decries the destructive plots and arrogant attitude of the wicked (*64:1-6*). The psalmist turns to God in prayer and takes heart in God’s justice because whatever the wicked do will be undone by the righteous judge. The godly will rejoice and grow in wisdom as they reflect on God’s mighty acts.\n\n
64:1	idm66814					 These verses form a prayer for rescue from bold and powerful liars.\n\n
64:3	idm66820					 **their tongues . . . bitter words:** Liars use their speech to kill. This description might also refer to practicing magic.\n\n
64:6	idm66827					 The enemies create a **perfect plan** to harm the innocent without getting caught. • Human beings will sink to unthinkable depths with evil words, acts, or plans (*83:3*; see *Jer 17:9*).\n\n
64:7	idm66836					 What God does is righteous. God undoes what is wicked and pays the wicked back with what they planned for others.\n\n
65:1	idm66842					 This psalm recounts the reasons why all people should praise and revere God for his almighty power and merciful care for his universe.\n\n
65:1	idm66848					 Praise is the appropriate response to God’s majestic deeds in redemption (*65:3-5*) and in nature (*65:5-13*).\n\n
65:1	idm66856					 God alone deserves **praise** and is worthy to have **vows** made to him.\n\n
65:2	idm66864					 **All of us** means all humans.\n\n
65:3	idm66871					 **you forgive:** God graciously removes the guilt of sin (see *32:5*).\n\n
65:4	idm66879					 **those you choose to bring near:** This includes people from Israel and from other nations. • Only those whom God sees as blameless **live in** his **holy courts** (*Pss 15* and *24*). • At the **Temple***,* God’s earthly palace, all nations can gather to experience God’s holy presence. No structure can separate humans from God (see *Rev 21:22*).\n\n
65:6	idm66893					 God brought order to **the mountains***,* the **raging oceans***,* and the **pounding waves** (see *Pss 95:4-5*; *104:6-9*). • The psalmist compares the chaotic forces of nature with the rebellion of the **nations** (see *2:1-12*; *33:6-11*; *46:6*).\n\n
65:8	idm66910					 All over the world (*Job 38:13*; see *Ps 50:1-3*), people should **stand in awe of** the Lord.\n\n
65:9	idm66919					 The created order provides clear evidence of God’s power (*65:6-8*). He shows his love by maintaining nature. Everything praises the Lord as all the parts fit together harmoniously.\n\n
65:9	idm66926					 The **river of God** and all rivers demonstrate God’s victorious power and goodness through the order in nature and the regularity of the harvests (see *1:3*; *36:8*; *46:4*; *Ezek 47:6-12*; *Zech 14:8*; *Rev 22:1*).\n\n
65:13	idm66939					 Nature bursts out in praise of the Creator (see *79:13*; *96:11-13*; *148:3-5*, *7-12*; *Isa 55:12-13*).\n\n
66:1	idm66950					 This anonymous psalm includes two hymns (*66:1-12*, *13-20*) that praise God for his redemption.\n\n
66:1	idm66958					 The psalmist exhorts nature to join in a mighty chorus to praise God’s glory, name, and power.\n\n
66:2	idm66964					 The **glory of his name** represents the perfection of God’s character.\n\n
66:3	idm66971					 God conquers his **enemies** (see *18:44*; *59:11*; *81:15*).\n\n
66:5	idm66981					 The story of the Exodus and God’s victory over the sea evokes responses of astonishment (*66:5*) and worship (*66:6*). God works **miracles . . . for people** in order to redeem them for himself.\n\n
66:7	idm66990					 God’s **power** brings redemption. The same word occurs in *65:6* for God’s power in creation (see also *80:2*).\n\n
66:8	idm66999					 The orderly lives of the redeemed reflect the order of God’s world. The Lord protects them from evil and purifies them.\n\n
66:9	idm67005					 God guides his people into wisdom and away from folly (*17:5*; *37:31*; *121:3*).\n\n
66:10	idm67014					 **You have tested us, O God:** As the silversmith heats **silver** to remove the dross, God’s discipline removes sin from his people (see *12:6*).\n\n
66:11	idm67023					 God decrees and permits the many trying circumstances his people experience.\n\n
66:12	idm67029					 **Then you put a leader over us:** Or *You made people ride over our heads.* This expression possibly refers to a foreign ruler who kept the Israelites in submission.\n\n
66:15	idm67037					 Vows often included sacrifices of thanksgiving, including **burnt offerings** (see *20:3*; *40:6*; *50:8*; *51:19*).\n\n
66:16	idm67048					 The private testimony in the conclusion of the psalm parallels the public praise of its opening (*66:1-4*).\n\n
66:18	idm67055					 Confession leads to restoration (see *32:5*).\n\n
67:1	idm67062					 In this anonymous prayer for God’s blessing, the psalmist addresses the knowledge and worship of God among the nations (cp. *64:9*; *65:8*). The prayer requests that God’s name be kept holy and that his kingdom come (cp. *Matt 6:9-13*).\n\n
67:1	idm67071					 This prayer is based on the priestly blessing found in *Num 6:24-26*. God’s goodness to Israel affects his reputation among the nations (see *Ps 96:1-3*).\n\n
67:3	idm67079					 God’s international reputation leads to his praise among the **nations** (see *138:4*), whose turmoil and rebelliousness will cease when they join Israel in praise of God. • One God rules over all, and the nations will give thanks for God’s just rule (see *67:4*).\n\n
67:4	idm67088					 God brings the ultimate **justice** that human beings desire (*96:10*; *98:9*).\n\n
67:6	idm67097					 Bountiful **harvests** are evidence of God’s blessing (*Gen 26:12*; *Isa 30:23*). • **all over the world:** See *Pss 2:8*; *96:1-3*. • All **will fear him***,* joining with Israel to acknowledge the God of Israel.\n\n
68:1	idm67111					 This prayer for God’s victorious rule traces God’s march from Sinai to Zion (*68:7*, *16-18*, *24*). He rescued the nation of Israel from Egypt, guided it through the wilderness, brought it into the Promised Land, and established his kingdom. He is a caring and victorious God, whose nature is unchanging. Therefore, the godly hope and rejoice in the prospect of God’s universal dominion.\n\n
68:1	idm67120					 These verses form a prayer for God to **rise up** and **scatter** his **enemies***,* as he did when Israel entered the Promised Land (cp. *Num 10:35-36*; *Josh 6–12*).\n\n
68:2	idm67132					 Both **smoke** and **wax** represent a transitory existence (*22:12-18*; *37:20*; *102:3*).\n\n
68:3	idm67143					 The lot of **the godly** contrasts with that of the wicked (see *1:6*).\n\n
68:4	idm67151					 The psalmist praises God’s powerful and compassionate reign.\n\n
68:4	idm67157					 **him who rides the clouds:** This is an ancient description of Baal, a Canaanite deity. The psalmist applies it to **the** Lord as the true “Rider of the Clouds” (see *68:33*; *104:3*). God wields power over the clouds and the rain.\n\n
68:5	idm67168					 God, the **Father** of all marginalized and needy people, shows them compassion and protects their rights (see *10:14*, *18*; *69:33*; *82:3*). • Like his **dwelling***,* the Lord **is holy**. The supreme example of the holy God coming down to rescue humanity is Jesus Christ.\n\n
68:6	idm67182					 God released Israel from slavery in Egypt (*Exod 20:2*; see *Ps 69:33*), and he still **sets the prisoners free**. • The **sun-scorched** desert represents alienation from God and separation from blessing.\n\n
68:8	idm67192					 The **earth trembled** as in an earthquake (see *Exod 19:18*). • **the heavens poured down rain:** Wells in the desert and rain showers in Canaan supplied an abundance of water.\n\n
68:11	idm67201					 **a great army** (or *a host of women*)** brings:** The Hebrew suggests women singers caroling **the good news** of victory (see *68:25*; *Exod 15:20*).\n\n
68:13	idm67213					 The seminomadic pastoral people **who lived among the sheepfolds** were surprised to receive **silver** and **gold** carvings from the battle.\n\n
68:14	idm67222					 **The Almighty** (Hebrew *Shaddai*) is an ancient designation for God (see *91:1*; *Gen 17:1*). • The identification of **Mount Zalmon** is uncertain; it was possibly a mountain in Bashan (see *Ps 68:15*).\n\n
68:15	idm67234					 **Bashan** is a plateau northeast of Jerusalem and east of the Sea of Galilee that was known for its woods and pastureland (see *22:12*; *Isa 2:13*). The **mountains** might have included Mount Hermon to the north of the plateau or Mount Zalmon, which might be Jebel ed-Druze on the east.\n\n
68:16	idm67244					 **Why do you look with envy?** Bashan is physically much more impressive than the mountains around Jerusalem, but it was not the home of the Lord. Only Mount Zion enjoyed the privilege of providing God’s dwelling place.\n\n
68:17	idm67251					 **Chariots***,* the ultimate weapon of the armed forces in the psalmist’s day, are an image of the Lord’s power to grant victory (*20:7*; *44:3*).\n\n
68:18	idm67261					 **When you ascended to the heights:** The Most High established his reign victoriously in Zion. • **a crowd of captives . . . gifts:** This is an image of a victorious ruler leading the victory march after battle. Paul applied this image to Jesus Christ (*Eph 4:8-13*).\n\n
68:19	idm67270					 The Divine Warrior cares for his people like a shepherd; the people praise him.\n\n
68:19	idm67276					 Like a caring father or a shepherd, God **carries** his people **in his arms** (see *55:22*; *68:5-6*).\n\n
68:21	idm67286					 **God will smash the heads of his enemies:** Cp. *Gen 3:15*.\n\n
68:22	idm67294					 God will deal with all **enemies***,* whether from high places (represented by **Bashan**) or low (**the depths of the sea**).\n\n
68:24	idm67304					 A great company joins together in the pilgrimage to Zion.\n\n
68:28	idm67310					 The people pray for God’s success and for victory over the enemy nations (*68:1-3*).\n\n
68:29	idm67317					 The conquered **kings** will bring gifts to the Lord.\n\n
68:30	idm67324					 Hostile and rebellious people delight in warfare and insurrection (see *2:1-3*).\n\n
68:32	idm67331					 The psalmist calls for the people to praise God, who is victorious over his enemies.\n\n
68:32	idm67337					 The term **kingdoms of the earth** includes all nations and power structures.\n\n
68:34	idm67344					 When the Lord demonstrates his **power***,*** majesty***,* and **strength** against the nations, he strengthens his people (see *96:4-6*).\n\n
69:1	idm67356					 These last four psalms of Book Two contrast with the psalms describing God’s mighty acts in creation and in redemption, capped by God’s march to Zion (*Pss 65–68*). *Psalms 69–71* portray the king’s anguish, and *Ps 72* responds with a prayer for God to bless the king.\n\n
69:1	idm67365					 In this individual lament, the poet expresses his vulnerability, humiliation, and overwhelming pain, asking God to vindicate him for the sake of the righteous.\n\n
69:1	idm67371					*title* **to the tune “Lilies”:** *Psalm 45* also notes this tune, but *Ps 45* celebrates the glory of kingship, whereas *Ps 69* is the cry of a tired king who feels abandoned by the Lord.\n\n
69:1	idm67382					 The psalmist sees himself as almost drowning but still surviving chaotic forces and alienation from God (see *42:7*; *69:14*, *15*; *Isa 8:8*).\n\n
69:4	idm67392					 John applied this lament to Jesus (*John 15:25*).\n\n
69:5	idm67399					 The psalmist confesses his **sins** and prays that God’s response to him will encourage others in similar conditions to place their hope in the Lord.\n\n
69:7	idm67406					 Mistreated and abandoned by family, friends, and community, the psalmist turns to the Lord for comfort, relief (*69:13-18*), and redress (*69:22-28*).\n\n
69:9	idm67414					 Though the psalmist concerns himself with God and all that is holy, **insults** have been his earthly reward. This verse was later applied to Jesus’ anger at the Temple’s money changers (*John 2:17*) and to his undeserved suffering (*Rom 15:3*).\n\n
69:10	idm67423					 When the psalmist denies himself normal comforts to seek God in prayer, the wicked ridicule him.\n\n
69:13	idm67429					 The psalmist’s only recourse is to pray for rescue and relief from his enemies.\n\n
69:19	idm67435					 Alone and misunderstood, the psalmist confesses that he cannot bear his doubts. His heart has been broken by his problems.\n\n
69:21	idm67441					 **sour wine for my thirst:** This description applies to Jesus’ suffering (*Matt 27:34*, *48*; *Luke 23:36*; *John 19:28-29*).\n\n
69:22	idm67452					 The psalmist wants God to transfer his suffering (*69:3*) to his enemies. Paul applied these words to the unbelieving Jews of his day (*Rom 11:9-10*).\n\n
69:25	idm67460					 Peter quoted this verse after the death of Judas Iscariot (*Acts 1:20*).\n\n
69:28	idm67467					 **Erase their names from the Book of Life:** Cp. *1:5-6*; *9:5*; *Rev 3:5*; *20:15*; *21:22-27*.\n\n
69:29	idm67479					 The psalmist prays that his pain will turn to praise.\n\n
69:31	idm67485					 Making a vow often included a sacrifice (*20:3*; *51:19*; cp. *50:13-14*; *51:16*).\n\n
69:32	idm67495					 **despise:** See *22:24*; cp. *Matt 25:36*; *Heb 13:3*.\n\n
69:34	idm67505					 The psalmist prays for Zion, offering a new petition from a new circumstance. He applies the prayer (*69:1-33*) to the desperate condition of Judah (see *51:18-19*).\n\n
69:36	idm67513					 God’s people **will inherit the land** because the wicked will perish (see *37:8-9*).\n\n
70:1	idm67521					 This psalm, nearly identical to *40:13-17*, contains an urgency (*70:1*, *5*) that fits with the surrounding psalms (cp. *69:17*; *71:12*).\n\n
70:1	idm67532					*title* **asking God to remember him:** The meaning of this phrase is unknown (also found in *38:title*).\n\n
71:1	idm67542					 This untitled lament by an aging believer is more of a confession of confidence and hope than the cry of someone abandoned by God. The psalmist experienced God’s power and protection in his youth (*71:5-8*) and now prays for rescue from the adversaries who stalk him in his old age (*71:9-13*). Even in the midst of his peril, he continues to tell of God’s past faithfulness and looks forward with hope to a time when he can testify to the next generation that God is faithful and righteous.\n\n
71:1	idm67550					 The poet has learned to acknowledge God as the reliable rock who will do what is right toward him and his oppressors. See also *31:1-3*.\n\n
71:5	idm67557					 The psalmist has **trusted** God throughout his life (see *22:9*).\n\n
71:9	idm67565					 The aging believer turns to the Lord for hope. As questions from his adversaries get under his skin and his own strength fails, he asks God to answer his prayers. He does not seek answers to prayer for himself but so that he can tell the story to the next generation.\n\n
71:9	idm67571					 The poet prays for continued fellowship with God (see *9:10*; *51:11*). In his weakness, he needs the Lord’s strength even more (see *143:7*).\n\n
71:10	idm67580					 In their **plotting***,* the psalmist’s enemies take counsel and scheme together (*2:2*; *21:11*; *31:13*; *35:4*; *63:9-10*).\n\n
71:14	idm67593					 The psalmist contrasts his own goodness with his enemies’ evil; he centers his life in the Lord, even during hard times (see *9:17-18*; *27:13-14*).\n\n
71:19	idm67601					 God’s righteous character provides encouragement and strength in the midst of suffering. The wounded psalmist confesses faith in God’s ability to transform his misery and weakness into abundant life.\n\n
71:20	idm67607					 **lift me up from the depths:** The psalmist hopes for the renewal of an abundant earthly **life**. This later became grounds for belief in the resurrection of the dead.\n\n
71:21	idm67615					 Being assured of God’s **comfort** also assures the poet of God’s presence, care, and goodness (*23:4*, *6*; *86:17*). God’s comfort enhances the psalmist’s sense of being alive (see *119:50*).\n\n
71:22	idm67626					 As he awaits God’s rescue, the psalmist prepares himself to declare with instruments and voice that God is faithful and righteous.\n\n
72:1	idm67632					 This royal psalm closes Book Two, with *72:18-20* functioning as an epilogue to all of Book Two. The psalmist reflects on the prospects of David’s royal line and on Zion (see *Pss 46*, *48*). He prays that Israel’s kings will be good and prosperous, extending the Lord’s blessing on his people throughout the whole earth. The surpassing righteousness and dominion sought in this prayer foreshadow the coming of Jesus, the Son of David.\n\n
72:1	idm67641					 The blessings of justice create a balance in nature, resulting in harmony, prosperity, and fertility.\n\n
72:1	idm67647					 **love of justice . . . righteousness:** Kings in the ancient Near East were expected to represent justice; the standard for Israel’s kings was much higher because the Lord was their model.\n\n
72:3	idm67654					 The administration of justice transforms the earth into fruitfulness, abundance, harmony, and goodness (see *Isa 32:16-17*).\n\n
72:4	idm67661					 A just ruler will **defend the poor** against injustice, **rescue** them from violence, and bring **their oppressors** to account for their wrongdoing.\n\n
72:5	idm67670					 **May they fear you:** In Hebrew, this clause seems to be a response to the enforcement of justice. The Greek version reads *May they endure,* which makes this a prayer for longevity (*21:4*; *72:15*, *17*).\n\n
72:6	idm67681					 The administration of justice is **refreshing like spring rain***,* enabling the **godly** to **flourish** (see *Isa 45:8*) like flowers. • **until the moon is no more:** This phrase means forever (see *Ps 89:36-37*).\n\n
72:8	idm67694					 The anointed king will rule over the whole world. Even hostile nations will submit to him. In the ancient Near East, bearing gifts to the king acknowledged his success and his reputation (see *1 Kgs 10*).\n\n
72:8	idm67701					 **from sea to sea:** This phrase represents the whole world. • Solomon’s kingdom extended **from the Euphrates River** in the east to the Philistine territory in the west (*1 Kgs 4:21*; see *Pss 80:8-11*; *89:19-25*), where the Mediterranean Sea appeared to be at **the ends of the earth** (see *2:8*). Everyone **will bow before** this king, including the **desert nomads** (*72:9*), **his enemies***,* and all the kings of the world (see *Mic 7:17*).\n\n
72:10	idm67720					 **The western kings of Tarshish** came from a major colony in the western basin of the Mediterranean. **The eastern kings of Sheba** came from an area in southern Arabia, home of the queen of Sheba (*1 Kgs 10*). • **Seba** was probably located somewhere south of Egypt, perhaps on the western shore of the Red Sea across from Sheba. • The **gifts** offered to the king represented a tribute and a token of submission.\n\n
72:11	idm67731					 **All kings** and **all nations** must submit to the messianic king. The hope expressed in *2:10-11* will be realized (see *96:1-3*; *1 Cor 15:25*) when other leaders and peoples **bow before** and **serve** this king.\n\n
72:12	idm67744					 The anointed king will rescue the needy. He is not only the judge but also a father to the poor (*10:14*, *17*; *68:5*).\n\n
72:12	idm67753					 To **rescue the poor** means to bring an end to the rule of their oppressors.\n\n
72:13	idm67760					 Like a father, the king **feels pity** for those in need (see *Mal 3:17*).\n\n
72:15	idm67768					 The just kingdom will be long-lasting and universal. The summary combines the themes of abundance of crops, longevity, tribute of the nations, and the prayer of the nations.\n\n
72:15	idm67774					 The **people** will **bless him***,* fulfilling God’s promise to Abraham (*Gen 12:3*; see *Ps 133:3*).\n\n
72:16	idm67785					 **the trees of Lebanon:** Lebanon was renowned for its lumber (see *study note on 2 Chr 2:8*).\n\n
72:18	idm67793					 This doxology concludes Book Two of the Psalter.\n\n
72:20	idm67799					 This parenthetical note ends Book Two, which consists mostly of **prayers of David**. Books Three to Five were probably compiled after Book Two; they include additional psalms of David (*Pss 86*, *101*, *103*, *108–110*, *122*, *124*, *131*, *133*, *138–145*).\n\n
73:1	idm67815					 The apparent prosperity of the wicked (*Ps 73*) and God’s apparent rejection of his people (*Ps 74*) raise questions about his justice. God is sovereign over the whole world, and he determines the time for judgment (*Ps 75*).\n\n
73:1	idm67824					 This wisdom psalm examines the injustice of the prosperity of the wicked. The psalmist affirms that God is good to the godly but his own experience differs (*73:2-12*). Nearly overcome by his doubts (*73:13-16*), the psalmist meets the Lord in the sanctuary and gains a perspective that stretches beyond his life and renews his confidence in God (*73:17-26*). His disturbing doubts stir a greater passion for truth. He knows that he can trust God and that God will rescue him (*73:27-28*).\n\n
73:1	idm67834					*title* **Asaph** was a Levitical singer appointed by David (*1 Chr 6:39*); his descendants were singers and instrumentalists (*1 Chr 15:16-17*). Many of the psalms of Asaph (*Pss 50*, *73–83*) were probably written by Asaph’s descendants at a later time in Israel’s history (e.g., *Ps 74*).\n\n
73:1	idm67847					 People **whose hearts are pure** are renewed by God’s Spirit (*51:10*), commit themselves to lives of godliness, keep away from anything that is sinful, and enjoy God’s presence (see *24:3-4*).\n\n
73:2	idm67856					 The poet sees the prosperity of the wicked as unfair (see *72:7*) and resents it. • The psalmist’s **feet were slipping** from the way of wisdom and godliness (see *17:5*; *37:31*), but God kept him from falling off the trail entirely (*38:16*; *66:9*; *94:18*; *121:3*). • **when I saw them prosper:** Cp. *72:3*, *7*.\n\n
73:4	idm67873					 The psalmist presents a caricature of the bliss of the wicked (cp. *Ps 1*).\n\n
73:6	idm67880					 The proud adorn themselves with **pride** and **cruelty** rather than wisdom (*Prov 1:9*).\n\n
73:9	idm67889					 The proud **boast**, claiming that they own everything and are not subject to anyone (see *2:1-3*).\n\n
73:13	idm67897					 Recognizing the ramifications of his discouragement and doubt, the psalmist turns to the Lord and receives special insight.\n\n
73:13	idm67903					 These rhetorical questions expect a discouraging “yes” for an answer. The psalmist wonders if godliness has become a meaningless ritual (see *Mal 3:14-15*). • **My heart** refers to his whole being. • The psalmist’s **pain** comes from discipline and rebuke (*Ps 39:11*; *Prov 1:23*, *25*; *12:1*).\n\n
73:15	idm67916					 If the psalmist had verbalized his suspicions about the futility of godly living, he would have discouraged God’s people and given God’s enemies an opportunity to blaspheme (cp. *John 13:20*). Instead, the psalmist internalizes the problem and reflects on it.\n\n
73:17	idm67923					 At this time, God’s **sanctuary** was the Temple in Jerusalem. There, in God’s presence, the psalmist receives special insight (cp. *18:6*). • God deals with the **wicked** over the long term. He waits patiently and gives them time to repent (*Ezek 33:11*; *2 Pet 3:9*); those who do not repent will get what they deserve.\n\n
73:21	idm67934					 The psalmist’s feelings about the prosperity of the wicked had given him a **bitter** spirit.\n\n
73:24	idm67941					 The Lord leads the godly through their troubles and changes their misery into splendor.\n\n
73:25	idm67947					 Nothing **in heaven** or **on earth** is better than being near God.\n\n
74:1	idm67955					 The psalmist laments the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem (586 BC) with vivid imagery, questions, fresh memories, and a direct appeal for the Lord to act (*74:19-23*).\n\n
74:1	idm67963					 In the aftermath of Jerusalem’s fall, it seemed that God had forgotten his special covenant relationship with his people.\n\n
74:1	idm67969					 God **rejected** his people because their sin aroused his anger (*106:34-46*). • Like a tender shepherd, God cares for his people, **the sheep of** his **pasture** (*Pss 23*; *100:3*).\n\n
74:2	idm67981					 The Lord **chose** and **redeemed** Israel from Egypt in the Exodus (cp. *Exod 15:13*). • **your own special possession:** This is another expression for “your people” (*Pss 28:9*; *78:62*; *94:14*; *106:40*).\n\n
74:3	idm67995					 Like a guide, the psalmist points out to the Lord what took place during the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC.\n\n
74:12	idm68002					 **my king from ages past:** The psalmist acknowledges God’s power and his historical bond with Israel (*5:2*; *44:4*; *84:3*).\n\n
74:14	idm68012					 **Leviathan:** See *104:26*; *Job 3:8*; *41:1*, *12*, *22*, *31*; *Isa 27:1*. Here, the creature’s multiple **heads** suggest a mythical monster.\n\n
74:15	idm68027					 **springs and streams to gush forth:** God provided water in the desert for his people (see *68:8-9*; *Exod 17:6*); he **dried up** the Red Sea (*Exod 14:21*) and the Jordan River (*Josh 3:17*).\n\n
74:19	idm68039					 The poet urges God to act.\n\n
75:1	idm68045					 This hymn of thanksgiving includes two direct messages from God that provide assurance of his justice (*75:2-3*, *10*). The Lord rebukes arrogant people who defy him, promising to forcibly humble them (*75:4-8*). Together, the community and the psalmist respond with thanksgiving for God’s character (*75:1*, *9*).\n\n
75:2	idm68056					 The Lord will bring justice in his own time.\n\n
75:4	idm68062					 **The wicked** arrogantly defy **the heavens**—the dwelling place of God. Through their **boasting** they insist that they are wiser than God.\n\n
75:6	idm68071					 No creature has the right to rebel against its Creator.\n\n
75:7	idm68077					 The Lord alone is the Judge, with the power to exalt and humble (see *1 Sam 2:7*; *Luke 1:52*).\n\n
76:1	idm68085					 This psalm appears to celebrate a victory. The victory might have been recent, such as over the Assyrians (see note on *76:title*; see also *Isa 37*); or the psalm might be recalling God’s great acts of rescue in the past.\n\n
76:1	idm68094					*title* **to be accompanied by stringed instruments:** The Greek version reads *for the Assyrian.*\n\n
76:1	idm68103					 God’s victory over Zion’s enemies foreshadows his worldwide victory over all his enemies.\n\n
76:3	idm68109					 God brings an end to the attacks of his enemies (see *46:9*).\n\n
76:4	idm68116					 The psalmist praises God for his achievement and for his **glorious** majesty.\n\n
76:4	idm68123					 The victorious king’s splendor, glory, and majesty are greater than anything in the created order (*8:1*; *29:4*; *111:3*).\n\n
76:7	idm68132					 The needy await their victorious God, while the wicked stand in fear of him.\n\n
76:7	idm68138					 The word translated **feared** (Hebrew *nora’*) is a wordplay on the word translated “glorious” in *76:4* (Hebrew *na’or*).\n\n
77:1	idm68148					 The psalmist laments that God has turned away from him, even though he feels innocent. He reflects on his situation (*77:3*, *6*, *12*) and finds hope (see *25:5*) in remembering God’s past deeds (*77:11*).\n\n
77:1	idm68159					 The **night** provides a special opportunity for prayer and meditation (*77:6*, *11*; see *6:6*; *16:7*; *17:3*; *30:5*; *63:6*; *119:55*, *62*, *148*).\n\n
77:3	idm68176					 **I think of God:** God’s people inevitably face difficult times, but recalling his mighty acts at the beginning of their relationship assures them of God’s commitment. • Feeling **overwhelmed***,* the psalmist is unable to deal with the crisis (*142:3*; *143:4*).\n\n
77:4	idm68187					 As the psalmist meditates at night, he feels so disturbed that he cannot sleep or speak. He has pleasant memories of the past, but he cannot look beyond the present moment into the future.\n\n
77:7	idm68193					 The psalmist questions his status before God.\n\n
77:7	idm68199					 Feeling **rejected** (see *43:2*), the psalmist asks if the situation is permanent.\n\n
77:10	idm68207					 The memories of God’s mighty works in the past fill the psalmist’s mind.\n\n
77:10	idm68213					 The psalmist fears that God’s **hand** of protection (*44:3*; *77:15*; *Exod 6:6*) and favor (*Pss 16:7-8*; *110:1*) is now **against** him for no apparent reason.\n\n
77:13	idm68226					 This central section of the poem reflects on God as the holy and powerful redeemer.\n\n
77:16	idm68232					 **the Red Sea:** The Canaanites attributed divine power to the sea, but God is the one who made the sea and uses it for his own purposes.\n\n
78:1	idm68239					 This wisdom psalm exhorts the people to learn wisdom and faithfully pass it on.\n\n
78:1	idm68245					 The prologue is an invitation to learn wisdom.\n\n
78:2	idm68251					 The psalmist recites Israel’s story (*78:5-72*) **in a parable** in order to teach wisdom and insight. • Jesus quoted this verse to explain why he taught in parables (*Matt 13:35*).\n\n
78:3	idm68260					 This story of what God has done should be told from generation to generation (see *Deut 6:20-25*; *Prov 4:1-4*).\n\n
78:5	idm68268					 The telling of the story should motivate God’s people to obey what he **commanded** (*Deut 6:4-9*).\n\n
78:7	idm68276					 God holds **each generation** responsible for its own response, which should be to maintain faith and **hope** (see *9:18*; *27:14*) and avoid being **stubborn, rebellious, and unfaithful** (see *Deut 9:6-7*; *10:16*; *30:6*; *31:27*).\n\n
78:9	idm68291					 **Ephraim***,* the second son of Joseph, received a special blessing from Jacob (*Gen 48:15-20*; *49:22-26*; *Deut 33:13-17*). The land that his descendants received included fertile valleys and strategic roads (*Judg 8:2*). However, the people of Ephraim did not live in obedience to God’s gracious covenant.\n\n
78:12	idm68303					 The focus shifts from Ephraim (*78:9-11*) to Israel as a whole as the psalmist reflects on God’s power in Egypt (see *81:4-7*) and in the wilderness.\n\n
78:12	idm68311					 **The miracles** are the ten plagues against Egypt that God performed during Israel’s captivity (*Exod 7–12*).\n\n
78:13	idm68319					 God **divided the sea** when Israel crossed through the Red Sea (see *Exod 14–15*).\n\n
78:14	idm68327					 God used a **cloud** and a **pillar of fire** to guide and protect Israel in the wilderness (*Exod 13:21-22*).\n\n
78:17	idm68336					 Israel rebelled in the wilderness despite God’s abundant provision.\n\n
78:23	idm68342					 Abundance comes through **the doors of heaven** (*Gen 8:2*; *2 Kgs 7:2*; *Mal 3:10*). • Israel ate **manna** for forty years in the wilderness (*Exod 16:31-36*; *John 6:31*).\n\n
78:26	idm68355					 God powerfully satisfied the people’s desires, but they did not respond with gratitude or faith. Therefore, God exercised his justice.\n\n
78:32	idm68361					 Israel’s rebellion resulted in God’s judgment, but even their short-lived and insincere repentance motivated God to exercise forbearance.\n\n
78:33	idm68367					 An entire generation died in the wilderness (*Num 14:22-23*, *28-35*).\n\n
78:34	idm68375					 Israel’s continued existence, in spite of the people’s rebellion and unbelief (*78:7-8*), was due to God’s compassion.\n\n
78:34	idm68382					 **They repented:** This demonstration of zeal was not sincere.\n\n
78:35	idm68389					 The Israelites **remembered** the right doctrine (*9:9*; *91:1*), but they did not allow God to change their **hearts** (*Lev 26:41*).\n\n
78:40	idm68400					 The Israelites **rebelled** even though the Lord had rescued them from powerful plagues.\n\n
78:56	idm68407					 Israel’s rebellion desecrated the Promised Land. The people built **shrines** to false gods and worshiped **idols** (*78:58*) during the period of the judges (e.g., *Judg 2:11*; *3:7*, *17-18*).\n\n
78:60	idm68419					 God **abandoned his dwelling at Shiloh** because of the people’s idol worship (*1 Sam 4:11*; *Jer 7:12*).\n\n
78:67	idm68428					 **The tribe of Ephraim** was not completely **rejected***,* but God favored Judah (*78:68*).\n\n
78:68	idm68438					 In the choice of **Mount Zion** instead of Shiloh as God’s **sanctuary** on earth, God moved from the north to the south (see *Ps 69*).\n\n
78:70	idm68447					 The God who had turned against his **own people** (*78:62*) chose **David***,* a shepherd (*Gen 46:34*; *1 Sam 16:10-11*), to become their **shepherd** (*Ps 78:52*; cp. *23:1*).\n\n
79:1	idm68462					 This lament describes the occasion of Jerusalem’s fall in 586 BC. The early history of Israel’s rebellions described in *Ps 78* provoked God’s wrath, resulting in the desolation of Zion described here as the defilement of the Temple and the disgraced bodies that littered the landscape. The psalmist then prays for forgiveness and rescue (*79:8-9*), as well as for God to pay back the nation’s enemies (*79:12-13*). Other psalms lamenting the Exile include *Pss 42–44*, *102*, *107*, *126*, *137*.\n\n
79:1	idm68477					 The poet laments the desecration of the Temple and the success of the enemy.\n\n
79:1	idm68483					 **your special possession:** This phrase might refer to the **land**, the **Temple** (see *61:5*), or the people (see *79:2*; *78:71*).\n\n
79:5	idm68495					 The intensity of God’s judgment surprises the people; they cry out in despair for compassion, forgiveness, and relief. Verses *6-7* are repeated almost verbatim in *Jer 10:25*.\n\n
79:6	idm68503					 The repentant among God’s people ask him to vent his anger not on them but on their wicked and unrepentant enemies.\n\n
79:8	idm68509					 The people’s accumulation of past **sins** contributed to the Exile (*2 Kgs 17:7-23*; *24:3-4*); however, the people perished because of their own sins (*Jer 31:30*; *Ezek 18:20*).\n\n
79:9	idm68520					 The people ask God to rescue them. Although Israel’s sins caused the tragedy, the **pagan nations** must also be held responsible for the bloodshed.\n\n
79:12	idm68527					 The Exile resulted in national suffering and in individual searching for the Lord. • **pay back:** See *1:6*; *94:2*; *Jer 32:18*. • The expression **seven times** signifies something complete. • Israel’s **neighbors** included Edom, Moab, and Ammon (see *Ps 137:7*; *2 Kgs 24:2*; *Obad 1*).\n\n
80:1	idm68542					 This psalm of lament might originate with the remnant of the northern kingdom after its fall in 722 BC. The people call on God as their Shepherd and as the God of Heaven’s Armies in the hope that he will return to them and restore them. They remember the Exodus and their special relationship with the Lord and conclude with an expression of renewed commitment to him (*80:18*).\n\n
80:1	idm68550					*title* **The tune “Lilies of the Covenant”** is unknown today.\n\n
80:1	idm68558					 The psalmist urgently calls upon the Lord to act.\n\n
80:1	idm68564					 God is the **Shepherd of Israel:** See also *23:1*; *28:9*; *78:52-53*. • **radiant glory . . . power:** These expressions (*145:11*) refer to God’s manifest presence.\n\n
80:3	idm68576					 This verse is repeated (with an increasing crescendo) in *80:7*, *19*.\n\n
80:4	idm68584					 The people cry out for rescue from the shame of their recent defeat. The enemy’s victory is less devastating, however, than the knowledge that they themselves are objects of God’s wrath.\n\n
80:8	idm68590					 Israel has a glorious past, beginning with its redemption from Egypt.\n\n
80:8	idm68596					 Israel had been a prosperous **grapevine** (*Gen 1:28*; *Gal 5:22-23*) that God **transplanted** into the land of Canaan at the time of the conquest. However, the people forgot the source of their prosperity and chose to do evil (*Isa 5:1-7*; *Hos 10:1*).\n\n
80:10	idm68608					 Solomon’s kingdom had extended **west to the Mediterranean Sea** and **east to the Euphrates River** (see *72:8-9*; *89:25*; *1 Kgs 4:21*).\n\n
80:12	idm68619					 **broken down our walls:** God no longer defended Israel (*Isa 5:5*).\n\n
80:13	idm68627					 The surrounding nations were ceremonially unclean, like a **wild boar** or vicious **wild animals**.\n\n
80:15	idm68635					 Israel was the **son** that God had brought out of Egypt (see *Hos 11:1*) and **planted** in the Holy Land.\n\n
80:16	idm68644					 The community prays for God to change their desperate situation and restore them. They are still the Lord’s chosen people.\n\n
80:17	idm68650					 The **son of your choice** was probably the northern kingdom of Israel, although it might allude to the king of David’s dynasty (*110:1*).\n\n
81:1	idm68658					 This warning message invites Israel to worship only the Lord and to enjoy the fullness of his blessing.\n\n
81:1	idm68664					 As a prelude to the message of warning, the psalmist invites Israel to contemplate their God in song and dance.\n\n
81:2	idm68670					 An Israelite **tambourine** was a hand drum—a round frame covered with a skin, used as a percussion instrument during festivities, often to accompany dancing (*68:25*; *149:3*; *150:4*). • The **sweet lyre** and **the harp***,* both stringed instruments, are the instruments most frequently mentioned in the psalms (e.g., *33:2*; *57:8*; *71:22*; *150:3*).\n\n
81:3	idm68687					 The **ram’s horn** mustered armies and announced special holy days (*47:5*; *98:6*). • **new moon:** The first day of the lunar month marked **a festival**.\n\n
81:4	idm68698					 The festival, a time to celebrate and listen to the Lord, took place at God’s appointed time.\n\n
81:5	idm68704					 **for Israel:** Literally *for Joseph.* The tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh (the sons of Joseph) are used here to refer to the entire nation of Israel.\n\n
81:6	idm68712					 The Lord heard Israel’s cry in Egypt and rescued them from oppressive slavery.\n\n
81:8	idm68718					 God pleads with his people to remember the covenant and the Ten Commandments.\n\n
81:10	idm68724					 God emphasizes that he and no one else **rescued** Israel. • The nation should **open** its **mouth wide** to take in God’s word (cp. *Deut 8:3*; *Ezek 3:1*).\n\n
81:11	idm68735					 The Lord helps Israel to understand that their failure was not because of his weakness.\n\n
81:13	idm68741					 God wants to give his children his goodness, but only if they **listen** (*Isa 1:18-19*; *28:12*; *48:18-19*; see *Deut 6:3*). • God promises to **subdue** the **enemies** (*Deut 9:3*) of those who walk the **paths** of obedience and loyalty. He will also richly feed his people (*Isa 1:19*).\n\n
82:1	idm68757					 God condemns those who mistreat the helpless.\n\n
82:1	idm68763					 **God presides** and stands ready to render **judgment** (see *Isa 3:13*). • **heaven’s court:** See *Job 1:6*.\n\n
82:2	idm68774					 Since justice marks God’s reign (*89:4*), he opposes **favoring the wicked**. So the psalmist is perplexed and cries out to God for justice (*82:3-4*, *8*).\n\n
82:5	idm68784					 The unjust **oppressors** cannot bring or restore order. **They wander about in darkness***,* unmoved by circumstances even when the whole world order falls apart around them (cp. *11:3*).\n\n
82:6	idm68794					 The **gods** (see study notes on *29:1-2*; *58:1*), **like mere mortals***,* cannot escape the judgment common to human rulers. Jesus quoted from this passage in *John 10:34*.\n\n
82:8	idm68806					 The **nations belong to** God; he will take over the realms formerly ruled by local deities and give them to his people, just as he did with the Promised Land.\n\n
83:1	idm68813					 This community lament asks God for rescue and victory. The terse poetry suggests difficult times. A powerful coalition desires to destroy Israel (*83:1-4*) and allies itself against God (*83:5-8*). Recalling the fate of others who came against Israel (*83:9-12*), the psalmist prays that the same will happen to these enemies (*83:13-16*) so that God will receive honor among them (*83:17-18*). It is unclear whether this psalm arose out of a specific historical instance of opposition by these nations, or if it is a poetic collage of nations representing Israel’s enemies.\n\n
83:1	idm68824					 The enemy has successfully intimidated God’s people, so the poet prays that the Lord will hear and act.\n\n
83:5	idm68830					 **signed a treaty:** The **allies** agreed to fight against God and his people. The nations that are named in the alliance were situated around Israel and Judah.\n\n
83:6	idm68838					 The **Edomites***,* descendants of Esau, were located to the southeast of Judah (see *Gen 25:30*; *32:3*; *36:1-8*). • **Ishmaelites** were desert-dwelling descendants of Hagar. • **Moabites** and **Ammonites** descended from Lot; both were located to the east of Israel and Judah. • The **Hagrites** were possibly located north of the Ammonites (*1 Chr 5:10*).\n\n
83:7	idm68854					 The **Gebalites** probably came from Gebal/Byblos on the coast of Lebanon. • The **Amalekites** were located south of Israel in the Negev. • **Philistia** was southwest of Judah, by the Mediterranean Sea. • **Tyre** was a port city on the Mediterranean, northwest of Israel.\n\n
83:8	idm68864					 **Assyria** was northeast of Israel and north of the Persian Gulf. • The **descendants of Lot** were the Moabites and the Ammonites (*83:6-7*).\n\n
83:9	idm68873					 The psalmist prays that God will miraculously destroy the new coalition as he did three other enemies; doing so would bring him glory.\n\n
83:9	idm68879					 The **Midianites***,* ruled by **Zebah** and **Zalmunna** and led by **Oreb and Zeeb***,* were Israel’s enemy in the days of Gideon (*Judg 7:1–8:5*). Barak’s coalition defeated **Sisera and Jabin** (*Judg 4*).\n\n
83:12	idm68894					 The coalition’s motivation for wiping out Israel was to acquire the land (see *Jer 3:19*).\n\n
83:13	idm68901					 **tumbleweed . . . chaff:** This dry plant material easily blows away (see *Isa 17:13*).\n\n
83:14	idm68909					 **fire . . . fierce storm . . . tempest:** These are images of God’s manifestation in judgment (see *Isa 29:6*).\n\n
84:1	idm68917					 The psalmist expresses his deep spiritual longing for God’s presence. He faints with longing as he reflects on the Temple and on pilgrims making the journey to Jerusalem (*84:1-7*). He prays for himself and for the community (*84:8-9*). The conclusion of the psalm (*84:10-12*) clarifies that the Temple represents God—the psalmist truly longs for God’s presence. He knows that God’s goodness is greater than life and that only God can give his people favor and honor (*84:10-11*).\n\n
84:1	idm68927					 The psalmist is far from the Temple. He turns toward it in hopeful reflection.\n\n
84:3	idm68933					 The poet envies the birds that have nesting places in and around the Temple.\n\n
84:4	idm68939					 The priests and Temple personnel lived in the Temple.\n\n
84:5	idm68945					 The pilgrimage to Jerusalem reenacted the Exodus, when God marvelously provided for his people (see *78:15-16*; *105:41*). The psalmist imagines the pains of travel turning to the joy of arrival.\n\n
84:5	idm68953					 Travelers needed **strength** to meet the challenges of **pilgrimage** by foot along unpaved paths, in all kinds of weather and with the possibility of assaults.\n\n
84:6	idm68961					 The **Valley of Weeping** probably refers to the anguish that lonely pilgrims endured (see *23:4*), rather than to an actual location. • **refreshing springs . . . autumn rains:** Even when pilgrims feel totally exhausted, the prospect of drawing near to the Lord renews their spirits (cp. *Isa 35:6-10*; *41:18-20*; *43:17-20*; *49:10*).\n\n
84:9	idm68974					 Both kings and priests were **anointed** to dedicate them for service (see *132:17*; *Exod 28:41*; *1 Sam 9:16*; *16:1-13*; cp. *Isa 61:1*; *Acts 10:38*).\n\n
84:10	idm68987					 The psalmist viewed being in God’s presence as much **better than** being **anywhere else**.\n\n
84:11	idm68995					 Some people worshiped the **sun** as a god, but the true God provides all that anyone needs.\n\n
85:1	idm69002					 The psalmist leads the postexilic community in lament and prayer for full redemption. He ponders God’s past rescue of Israel from exile (*85:1-3*), longs for greater evidence of God’s goodness, and leads the community in prayer for full restoration (*85:4-7*). God responds with a message of peace (*85:8-9*), and the psalm concludes with a lyrical outburst at the grandeur of God’s salvation (*85:10-13*).\n\n
85:1	idm69012					 Though the psalmist gratefully acknowledges God’s goodness, he also asks God whether his wrath will last forever.\n\n
85:1	idm69018					 God **restored the fortunes** of Israel by bringing the nation back from exile (see *14:7*; *126:1*).\n\n
85:2	idm69027					 When God **forgave the guilt** of **their sins***,* he gave the people the possibility of fellowship with him (see *32:5*).\n\n
85:6	idm69037					 This prayer for renewal is based on God’s **unfailing love** for his people.\n\n
85:8	idm69044					 When **God the** Lord speaks, **his faithful people** listen. He promises them **peace***,* meaning wholeness and well-being (see *37:11*). They fear the Lord and know that he and **his salvation** are **near** to them. • The Lord does not tolerate **foolish ways***,* such as those that resulted in the Exile.\n\n
85:10	idm69060					 In the glorious world of renewal and salvation, all the qualities of God’s care—**love***,*** truth***,* **righteousness***,* and **peace**—come together and transform the created order into something new (see *Isa 32:15-20*).\n\n
85:13	idm69074					 **Righteousness** is like a messenger preparing the world for God’s coming in response to the prayers of his people (*85:4-7*; *89:14*).\n\n
86:1	idm69083					 The psalmist invokes God’s help and praises his character in a lament prompted by the presence of evil (*86:14*, *17*). All people will worship the gracious and almighty God (*86:8-10*). To this end, the poet commits himself to a lifestyle of ethical integrity (*86:11*) and praising the Lord (*86:12-13*). The last stanza contrasts the qualities of evil people with those of the Lord (*86:14-17*).\n\n
86:1	idm69095					*title* This is the only psalm connected with **David** in Book Three.\n\n
86:1	idm69103					 God’s devoted servant prays for mercy. The psalmist sees himself as a member of the covenant community and as a citizen of the world.\n\n
86:5	idm69109					 The psalmist appeals to God to remain true to his character, which is the basis for hope.\n\n
86:5	idm69115					 The psalmist recounts the catalog of divine perfections (*Exod 34:6-7*), especially God’s willingness to forgive sin (see *Pss 32:5*; *85:2*; *145:7-10*).\n\n
86:8	idm69125					 **All the nations** must submit themselves to the Lord and worship him (*45:17*; *117:1*; *148:7-11*).\n\n
86:11	idm69135					 The poet responds to the Lord by seeking faithful instruction in the **truth**. • An individual with **purity of heart** has integrity and wholeness (see *73:1*).\n\n
86:12	idm69144					 In anticipation of God’s rescue, the psalmist praises him and trusts in his goodness.\n\n
86:14	idm69150					 The arrogant exist both inside and outside the community. The psalmist asks for a vision of God’s character; God is so great that just a glimpse of his goodness will shut the mouths of the wicked.\n\n
86:15	idm69156					 God has **mercy** on his people (*51:1*); he is gracious (*25:6*), **slow to get angry** (*103:8*; *145:8*), and **filled with unfailing love and faithfulness** (Hebrew *khesed* and *’emeth*; *143:1*). This verse repeats a theme first expressed in *Exod 34:7*; *Num 14:18* (cp. *Pss 103:8*; *145:8*; *Neh 9:17*; *Joel 2:13*; *Jon 4:2*).\n\n
87:1	idm69179					 This psalm envisions Jerusalem as the city of God where all the nations are citizens.\n\n
87:1	idm69185					 Jerusalem was Israel’s capital and the location of the Temple, God’s earthly palace (see *Ps 84*).\n\n
87:4	idm69192					 As great as Zion is, it will be even greater when it becomes an international city where believers from all the nations have citizenship. • God keeps a record of all who confess him as their Lord (*Dan 7:10*; *Rev 13:8*).\n\n
87:5	idm69200					 **Jerusalem** becomes the international city where all God’s children are **citizens**.\n\n
88:1	idm69208					 In this lament, the psalmist sees himself as cast out from God’s presence. At first, he calls on the Lord. When he finds no relief from his suffering, he presents three charges against God (*88:6-7*, *8-12*, *13-17*).\n\n
88:1	idm69217					*title* **Heman the Ezrahite** might be a sage from Solomon’s time (*1 Kgs 4:31*), a descendant of Judah (*1 Chr 2:6*), or a member of the Levitical family charged with singing at the Temple (*1 Chr 15:17*; *2 Chr 5:12*).\n\n
88:1	idm69229					 The psalmist calls on the Lord for **salvation**.\n\n
88:6	idm69237					 In his first charge, the psalmist blames the Lord for his demise. God’s overpowering anger did not make sense. • The phrase **the darkest depths** implies the place of the dead (*143:3*; see *Lam 3:6*) or the depths of the sea (*Pss 68:22*; *69:1-2*).\n\n
88:8	idm69248					 In his second charge, the psalmist claims that God has isolated him and caused his loneliness (cp. *31:11*; *38:11*). Loneliness was a curse in a culture where relationships were more important than personal achievement.\n\n
88:13	idm69256					 In his third charge, the psalmist accuses the Lord of rejecting him. The force and apparent cruelty of the psalmist’s suffering overwhelm him.\n\n
88:18	idm69262					 The psalmist restates his second and first charges.\n\n
89:1	idm69268					 Book Three (*Pss 73–89*) begins and ends with weighty questions. Though *Ps 89* begins with a praise-filled account of how the Lord exalted the throne of David (*89:1-37*), the psalmist protests the Lord’s apparent rejection of his covenant with David (*89:38-51*; see *2 Sam 7:8-16*).\n\n
89:1	idm69279					*title* **Ethan the Ezrahite** was a wise man (*1 Kgs 4:31*; cp. *Ps 88:title*).\n\n
89:1	idm69290					 God’s **unfailing love** gives reason to celebrate **forever**.\n\n
89:3	idm69298					 The psalmist restates God’s covenant with David (see also *89:19-37*).\n\n
89:3	idm69305					 The Lord has **sworn** by his own holiness (*89:35*; see *110:4*).\n\n
89:5	idm69314					 God is the absolute standard of **faithfulness**, commitment, and order. The angelic beings and the heavens testify to his constancy.\n\n
89:5	idm69321					 Praise for God’s greatness (see *8:1*) comes from the inhabitants of **heaven** who witness his **faithfulness**.\n\n
89:6	idm69330					 **mightiest angel:** Literally *son of God* (see *study note on 29:1-2*).\n\n
89:9	idm69339					 In this hymn, the psalmist celebrates God’s comprehensive and powerful sovereignty over nature.\n\n
89:9	idm69345					 The Lord rules over all parts of the created order, including evil. • **You scattered your enemies:** The Lord will crush (*Luke 1:51*) evil powers that oppose him (*Ps 2:1-3*). • **with your mighty arm:** This phrase represents God’s strength (*89:13*).\n\n
89:12	idm69356					 **Mount Tabor** was in northern Israel. **Mount Hermon** formed the extreme northern border of the nation.\n\n
89:14	idm69364					 God rules wisely over creation. The qualities of **righteousness, justice,** and faithfulness fit the profile of a wise ruler. The **happy** people who live under his rule enjoy his **protection.**\n\n
89:15	idm69373					 Those who are wise **worship** God, **walk** in his **light***,* **rejoice** in their relationship with him, and **exult in** his character.\n\n
89:17	idm69385					 The Lord protects his people with the same power by which he established the created order.\n\n
89:19	idm69391					 The Lord chose David as his son and as king of Israel (see *2:4-6*; *2 Sam 7:8-16*) to provide protection for his people.\n\n
89:20	idm69399					 **I have anointed him:** This is the verb from which *anointed one* (Hebrew *mashiakh*, “messiah”) is derived.\n\n
89:26	idm69408					 The Lord adopted David as his **son,** appointed him as his commander over the nations, and promised to support him **forever.** Verse 26 recalls a verse from David’s song of praise (*2 Sam 22:47*).\n\n
89:27	idm69417					 David would be the most eminent of earthly kings. The Hebrew word translated **mightiest** is the same as the designation for God as “Most High” (*‘elyon*).\n\n
89:29	idm69425					 The Lord writes his faithfulness in **heaven***,* on the canvas of his universe (see *89:2*). He records his commitment to the dynasty of David in the same way.\n\n
89:30	idm69434					 The Lord disciplines but does not reject his erring children. He foresees violation of trust and subsequent punishment, but he commits himself to uphold the covenant. His fidelity to David corresponds to his faithfulness to the created order.\n\n
89:35	idm69440					 **holiness:** The Lord is wholly distinct from the created order (*22:3*); his character is totally pure. He does as he pleases (*115:3*), and he chooses to be faithful (*89:1*; *115:1*); therefore, he **cannot lie.**\n\n
89:38	idm69452					 **You are angry:** The harshness of God’s wrath perplexes the psalmist.\n\n
89:40	idm69459					 **broken down the walls:** The Lord’s people are completely vulnerable.\n\n
89:42	idm69466					 Although the Lord promised to strengthen David, he secretly **strengthened** David’s **enemies**.\n\n
89:46	idm69474					 The psalmist wonders if he will live to see the end of the Lord’s **anger**. Our lifetimes are **short***,* like a day in the Lord’s sight (*90:4*, *10*).\n\n
89:50	idm69485					 The phrase **your servants** refers to the community loyal to the Lord.\n\n
89:52	idm69492					 This doxology concludes all of Book Three (*Pss 73–89*); it is not intended to be read as part of *Ps 89*. It stands in stark contrast to the anguish and questioning of *Ps 89*. Cp. *41:13*; *106:48*.\n\n
90:1	idm69503					 Although the Lord’s people have made their home in him for generations, their sin widens the gap between them and their infinite Lord. The Lord’s wrath against a person’s sin might last a lifetime and yet be only a taste of his displeasure with sin. This lamentable situation calls the community to seek the Lord’s light. Taking the first step means seeking restoration with the Lord on the basis of his compassion and love (*90:13-14*). He alone makes his servants glad and blesses their future generations (*90:16-17*).\n\n
90:1	idm69511					*title* **Moses** led God’s people from slavery in Egypt to Mount Sinai, where he received the law and established God’s covenant with Israel. • **the man of God:** Moses enjoyed a special relationship with God (*Deut 33:1*).\n\n
90:1	idm69521					 The Lord becomes the **home** of the godly; he has provided shelter for countless **generations.** The word translated *home* is not used frequently in the Psalter. It describes a place of safety where the Lord meets his needy people and cares for them (*68:5*; *71:3*).\n\n
90:2	idm69532					 The Lord is the eternal God. • The Lord **gave birth to the earth** by creating it.\n\n
90:3	idm69539					 Unlike God, humans are mortal and transitory.\n\n
90:7	idm69545					 Sinners cannot escape God’s wrath because the Lord sees their **sins.** Their fleeting **lives** are filled with afflictions.\n\n
90:9	idm69553					 A **groan** of sorrow (*Ezek 2:10*) sums up a life spent in facing the consequences of sin. • Humans cause **trouble** (see *Ps 10:6*) and receive **pain** in return.\n\n
90:11	idm69564					 In the search for wisdom, no one **can comprehend** the Lord (see *Isa 40:13*). The appropriate human response to the Lord is godly **fear** (see *Ps 60:4*). The Lord alone can **teach** humans to follow the path of **wisdom** (*25:4-6*).\n\n
90:13	idm69577					 The psalmist prays for the Lord’s favor and restoration.\n\n
90:13	idm69583					 The phrase **your servants** refers to the community of those loyal to the Lord.\n\n
90:15	idm69590					 The psalmist calls upon the Lord to **give** the people **gladness** to replace their mourning (see *92:4-5*).\n\n
90:16	idm69599					 The **children** represent future generations in contrast to the generations past (*90:1*).\n\n
90:17	idm69607					 Humans waste their **efforts** unless the Lord makes them **successful** (*44:3*).\n\n
91:1	idm69616					 This wisdom psalm expresses confidence in the Almighty God, who provides a shelter for those who take refuge in him. They receive redemption, life, and glory from the Lord, who loves and cares for those who seek him.\n\n
91:1	idm69622					 The Lord is an ancient **shelter** (see *90:1*), open to those who seek **refuge** in him.\n\n
91:1	idm69631					 The **Most High** is an ancient title that expresses the Lord’s exalted status as the ruler and protector of the godly (see *Gen 14:19*).\n\n
91:3	idm69639					 The psalmist invites the godly to trust in the Lord and find protection in him.\n\n
91:3	idm69645					 God protects the godly from **deadly disease** and even a destructive word.\n\n
91:4	idm69652					 The **armor** might refer to a body shield, while **protection** refers to a small shield worn on the arm.\n\n
91:5	idm69660					 The godly should **not be afraid***,* because the Lord watches over them. These promises do not guarantee an escape from trouble, but they create an expectation of the Lord’s goodness.\n\n
91:6	idm69668					 The reference to **disease** represents any kind of affliction.\n\n
91:9	idm69675					 The poet again invites the godly to seek refuge in the Lord and enjoy the benefits of divine protection.\n\n
91:11	idm69681					 **he will order his angels:** Satan cited these words when he tempted Jesus (*Matt 4:6*; *Luke 4:10-11*), but God makes this promise for those who obey him (*Ps 91:14*), not for those who arrogantly test him (*Matt 4:4*, *7*).\n\n
91:14	idm69693					 The godly can trust the Lord’s protection and provision.\n\n
91:14	idm69699					 Those who **love** the Lord will obey him (*Deut 30:20*; *1 Jn 5:3*) and seek his protection (*Pss 91:1*; *145:18*).\n\n
91:15	idm69710					 The Lord promises to **answer** the prayers of his people. • The Psalter often speaks of people honoring the Lord (*50:15*); here, God promises to **honor** the godly who risk everything for his sake (*62:7*; *71:21*; *84:11*).\n\n
91:16	idm69722					 A **long life** on earth represents just a small part of the Lord’s goodness and eternal friendship (*23:6*).\n\n
92:1	idm69730					 Thanksgiving and praise open this psalm. The Lord—the Most High—is faithful and just in discerning between the godly and the wicked. The godly will enjoy a glorious, vigorous future, while the wicked will perish. The wise see and understand the Lord’s works as they reveal his justice (*92:6-7*, *11*, *15*). The wicked, like grass, are quickly destroyed (*92:7-10*).\n\n
92:1	idm69740					*title* **on the Sabbath Day:** Jewish tradition assigned one psalm to each day of the week: Sunday (*Ps 24*), Monday (*Ps 48*), Tuesday (*Ps 82*), Wednesday (*Ps 94*), Thursday (*Ps 81*), Friday (*Ps 93*), and the Sabbath (*Ps 92*). This is the only psalm that indicates this use in its title.\n\n
92:1	idm69755					 The psalmist offers praise and thanksgiving for God’s unfailing love and faithfulness.\n\n
92:4	idm69761					 Fools perish because they do not understand the Lord’s marvelous works and eternal plans.\n\n
92:4	idm69767					 The Lord acts and the psalmist responds in praise (*92:4*). God’s actions spring from his thoughts (*92:5*).\n\n
92:5	idm69775					 The Lord’s **thoughts** do not make sense to the **simpleton** or the **fool***,* the immoral person who desires no wisdom (*Prov 1:22*; *10:23*).\n\n
92:7	idm69787					 Even when the ungodly seem to grow luxuriantly (*73:3-5*), they have no future (*92:9*; see *1:6*; *90:5-6*; *Isa 40:6-8*).\n\n
92:8	idm69798					 The glory of the Lord provides the reason for the poet’s renewed strength and glory, and for the imminent defeat of the enemy.\n\n
92:8	idm69804					 The transcendent Lord stays above the world of human experience. From this **exalted** place, he rules and judges (*7:7*), celebrates his victories (*68:18*; see *Ps 47*), comes to rescue the needy (*102:19*), brings an end to the wicked (*92:7-8*), and receives praise (*148:1*).\n\n
92:10	idm69817					 **as strong as a wild ox:** The Lord allows the psalmist to share his exaltation (*92:8*), thus ensuring victory.\n\n
92:11	idm69825					 The psalmist understands the Lord’s mighty acts. He shares in the glory of the wise of heart.\n\n
92:12	idm69831					 Carvings of **palm trees** (*1 Kgs 6:29*, *32*, *35*; *7:36*) adorned the Temple, and builders made rich use of **cedars** (*1 Kgs 5:6*). The trees represent the godly, who are planted in the very courts of the Temple.\n\n
92:13	idm69844					 The Temple area consisted of **the** Lord**’s own house** and the **courts** that surrounded it.\n\n
92:15	idm69854					 **There is no evil in him!** The Lord is consistently just; he rightly judges everyone (see *Zeph 3:5*).\n\n
93:1	idm69862					 These psalms challenge the doubts created by the Exile (see *Ps 89*) and answer the questions asked in *90:11*, *13*. The Lord has established a kingdom (*Ps 93*) that is characterized by the punishment of the wicked (*Ps 94*), reverent obedience among his people (*Ps 95*), justice for the poor (*Ps 96*), celebration in Zion (*Ps 97*), salvation for Israel (*Ps 98*), holiness (*Ps 99*), and praise (*Ps 100*).\n\n
93:1	idm69879					 The everlasting Lord gloriously establishes his kingship (cp. *Pss 47*, *99–100*).\n\n
93:1	idm69887					 **robed in majesty:** The Lord stands victorious both before and after battle (see *45:3*).\n\n
93:3	idm69895					 God’s victory over natural chaos gives the psalmist confidence that the Lord will also defeat his present enemies (cp. *Jer 46:8*; *47:2*).\n\n
93:5	idm69903					 Through his stable rule and **royal laws***,* the Lord orders the world. • **Your reign** (literally *your house*): The *house* from which God reigns might be the Lord’s heavenly palace or the earthly Temple.\n\n
94:1	idm69914					 This plea for the Lord’s justice includes both communal and individual expressions of lament (*94:1-7*, *16-23*). The psalmist gives voice to the pain and suffering caused by the wicked, but he also depicts the comfort and stability of the Lord’s protection. He calls on the Lord to avenge the needy against the arrogant and foolish, he rebukes such people for their folly (*94:8-11*), and he pronounces a blessing on the wise (*94:12-15*).\n\n
94:1	idm69924					 After the community falls victim to the **wicked** (*94:5-7*), they pray that the Lord will render **justice** (see *7:11*; *9:12*).\n\n
94:2	idm69935					 Just as the Lord’s enemies rise up against him and his people (*3:7*; *93:3*), he must **arise** and make retribution against the enemy (see *79:12*; *Isa 65:6*).\n\n
94:6	idm69946					 **widows . . . foreigners . . . orphans:** The Lord’s law protects needy people (*Deut 24:17*; *27:19*), but they remain vulnerable in society.\n\n
94:7	idm69955					 The wicked think that they can get away with their vile acts and speech, foolishly assuming that God **isn’t looking** or **doesn’t care**.\n\n
94:8	idm69963					 The psalmist rebukes human folly.\n\n
94:9	idm69969					 It is preposterous that those with **ears** and **eyes** would imagine their Creator to be **deaf** and **blind**.\n\n
94:10	idm69979					 **punishes:** This word also carries the idea of “warns” (*2:10*), “disciplines” (*6:1*; *94:12*), or “instructs” (*16:7*). The Lord disciplines his people to purify their character (*Prov 3:11-12*; *Heb 12:6-11*). He punishes his enemies by giving them what they deserve (*Ps 1:6*; *Rom 6:23*).\n\n
94:11	idm69994					 While the Lord’s thoughts are deep, **people’s thoughts** are **worthless** (cp. *92:5*; *1 Cor 3:20*).\n\n
94:12	idm70004					 True to his nature, the Lord rewards those who live by his wise instruction and makes them happy according to his promises.\n\n
94:13	idm70010					 God’s **relief** includes his comfort and rescue.\n\n
94:14	idm70017					 Even when it seems that he has, **the** Lord** will not reject his people.**\n\n
94:16	idm70026					 The psalmist’s prayer resumes (see *94:1-7*) with a desperate cry for the Lord’s justice; it concludes with the hopeful expectation that evil will end.\n\n
94:16	idm70033					 Only God has the power to **stand up** to the wicked (see *2:2*).\n\n
94:18	idm70041					 The psalmist’s experience of **slipping** contrasts with God’s promise to stand with him (*94:12-13*; see *15:5*; *93:1*).\n\n
95:1	idm70051					 This call to worship urges the people to respond to the Lord, the Shepherd, and to follow him faithfully. The previous generation, who refused to obey, did not receive the blessings of the Promised Land.\n\n
95:3	idm70057					 The Lord is the **great King** over the whole universe.\n\n
95:3	idm70064					 **above all gods:** The psalmist refutes idolatry and paganism (*96:4-6*; *135:15-18*; see also *Isa 46:5-7*).\n\n
95:4	idm70074					 The whole created order owes its existence to the sovereign Lord alone—not to various gods.\n\n
95:6	idm70080					 The great King cares for his people as a shepherd cares for his **flock** (*Isa 40:11*). • The Lord** our maker***,* the Creator of heaven and earth, also made a people for himself (*Isa 45:9-12*; *51:12-16*).\n\n
95:8	idm70093					 If people want to enter into the Lord’s rest, they need to respond immediately (see *Heb 3:7–4:11*).\n\n
95:8	idm70100					 To **harden your hearts** means to be stubborn and resist the Lord’s grace (see *Num 20:2-13*; see also *Matt 13:3-23*; *John 12:37-43*; *Eph 4:17-32*; *Heb 3:6-19*; *4:6-11*).\n\n
95:9	idm70113					 Israel’s **ancestors . . . saw** the wonders of the Lord, but they foolishly did not try to grasp their significance (see *92:5-6*).\n\n
95:11	idm70121					 The generation of Israel that wandered in the wilderness for forty years failed to enter the **place of rest** that Israel enjoyed after the conquest of the land (*1 Kgs 8:56*; see *Deut 12:9*). The Lord promised them the land and gave it to them (*Isa 28:12*), but they did not obey him (*Isa 28:1*). The warning reminds every generation of the need to obey in faith. • The rest that God provides includes peace, provision, and protection (*Ps 132:14-18*). The author of Hebrews challenged a new generation to enter the rest provided by Jesus Christ (*Heb 3:7–4:13*).\n\n
96:1	idm70134					 This psalm establishes the Lord’s universal kingship (see *Ps 93*) and prepares for the coming of the Lord to bring justice and righteousness into the world. The psalmist invites everyone to worship the Lord (*96:1-3*), the glorious Creator of all the earth (*96:4-6*), because worship is due to him alone (*96:7-9*). The universe joins in praise as the righteous Judge establishes a new order (*96:10-13*). • This psalm (along with *105:1-15*; *106:1*, *47-48*) is included in David’s song of praise recorded in *1 Chr 16:1-43*.\n\n
96:1	idm70149					 Three psalms open with the exhortation to **sing a new song** (*Pss 96*, *98*, *149*); the song celebrates the Lord’s universal kingship (see *33:3*).\n\n
96:4	idm70160					 The gods of the nations are as nothing before the glorious and majestic Creator of the earth.\n\n
96:4	idm70166					 **Great is the** Lord**! . . . most worthy of praise:** With this refrain, the poet exalts the Lord over all the gods (*95:3*) and nations (*99:2*). He inspires awe more than anyone or anything else (*76:7*, *12*; *89:7*; *99:3*; *111:9*). He is beyond human possession or comprehension. The story of what he does to redeem his people causes them to praise him.\n\n
96:5	idm70182					 The Lord** made the heavens***,* an even greater task than creating the earth. The **idols***,* made by human hands (*115:4*), created nothing.\n\n
96:6	idm70194					 **Honor and majesty:** The Lord is glorious (*96:6*; *104:1*; *148:13*), and so are his works in nature (*8:1*) and in redemption (*111:3*; *145:5*).\n\n
96:7	idm70207					 **nations of the world** (literally *families of the nations*): Families and clans represent subdivisions of the nations (see *Gen 12:3*). • The nations must respond to the Lord’s glory (*Pss 8:1*; *19:1-4*; *24:7*).\n\n
96:8	idm70219					 The **courts** of God’s sanctuary were usually off-limits to non-Jewish people. In this psalm the nations of the world—the non-Jews—are invited in (*65:4*; *84:2*, *10*; *100:4*; *116:19*; *135:2*; *Isa 1:12*).\n\n
96:9	idm70233					 Worshipers should **tremble** in awe (*96:4*; see *18:7-15*; *97:4*) at the **splendor** of the Lord’s majesty and holiness (*Heb 12:25*).\n\n
96:10	idm70245					 The Lord’s coming means the end of injustice. He rules fairly (*9:8*; *96:13*; *98:9*) and inaugurates an era of harmony and order not experienced since Eden. • The Lord’s reign over **the world** is founded on the strong pillars of “righteousness and justice” (*89:14*), so it **cannot be shaken** (cp. *11:3*).\n\n
96:11	idm70258					 The psalmist exhorts the created order to respond with joy to the news of the Lord’s coming. Cp. a similar theme in *98:7-9*.\n\n
96:12	idm70265					 All of nature will experience renewal in God’s presence (*65:13*; *72:6*, *16*; *Isa 44:23*; *55:12*; *Rom 8:21-22*).\n\n
97:1	idm70277					 God is greatly exalted over the gods and over all the earth. Awe-inspiring phenomena accompany his coming. Even the created order is visibly affected and the wicked perish, but the people of Zion love his coming and rejoice.\n\n
97:1	idm70283					 The **farthest coastlands** represent the most remote parts of the world.\n\n
97:2	idm70290					 **Dark clouds . . . Fire . . . lightning:** This language shows that the Lord is coming in judgment.\n\n
97:5	idm70297					 The created order stirs at the coming of its King. He alone deserves worship.\n\n
97:6	idm70303					 As the Lord enters the world, the testimony of his righteousness resounds from above (*50:6*). • **Every nation** will view the open display of the Lord’s **glory** (see *8:1*; *19:1-4a*; *24:7*; *Isa 40:5*).\n\n
97:7	idm70316					 At the Lord’s coming, when **every god must bow** to him, those who worship other gods will face their own folly (see *95:3-5*).\n\n
97:8	idm70324					 **Jerusalem** rejoices at the news of the Lord’s coming, for he brings justice and rescues the upright of heart.\n\n
97:11	idm70331					 The godly people of integrity (see *Prov 2:7*, *21*; *3:32*; *11:6*, *11*; *14:2*), **whose hearts are right***,* maintain a relationship with the Lord and with others (*Pss 94:15*; *125:4*). The wicked plan the downfall of the godly (*11:2*), but the Lord rescues them (*11:1*; *36:10*). Then the sorrows of the godly turn to joy and praise (*32:11*; *64:10*; *111:1*; *119:7*).\n\n
98:1	idm70354					 This psalm celebrates the Lord’s kingship. The Lord is Israel’s true King, its champion and savior. His people sing a new song celebrating his victorious power and faithfulness to them. The Lord displays his righteous rule to all the nations throughout the earth, which will culminate in a worldwide kingdom of justice (*98:2*, *9*). Consequently, all the earth must worship and rejoice together because the Lord is coming (*98:4-6*).\n\n
98:2	idm70363					 The Lord makes known his righteousness and faithfulness (see also *Isa 52:10*).\n\n
98:4	idm70370					 The psalmist invites the whole earth to worship the King (see *96:1*).\n\n
98:6	idm70377					 The Temple musicians used **trumpets** to call people together for meetings (cp. *81:3*).\n\n
98:7	idm70385					 The created order is personified as rejoicing at the coming of the righteous Judge (see *93:3-4*; *96:11-13*).\n\n
99:1	idm70393					 The psalmist calls the nations to worship the Lord, the king of the earth who rules from Zion.\n\n
99:1	idm70399					 The Lord is the holy and righteous King (*Isa 6:1-5*). Mount Zion, the location of the Lord’s Temple, metaphorically stands as the highest point on earth (*Ps 113:4*; *Isa 2:2*; *6:1*). From this summit, the Great King (*Ps 47:2*) can see, rule over, and receive praise from all nations and peoples.\n\n
99:1	idm70410					 It is fitting to **tremble** and **quake** in response to the Lord’s holiness (see *96:9*). • The **throne between the cherubim** refers to the cover of the Ark of the Covenant (*Exod 25:17-22*).\n\n
99:4	idm70421					 The qualities of the Lord’s rule include strength, **justice***,* love, **fairness***,* and **righteousness** (see *93:4*; *97:2*, *6-7*, *12*; *98:2-3*, *9*; *138:6*).\n\n
99:6	idm70439					 God showed favor by responding to his people in the past, while holding sinners accountable.\n\n
99:6	idm70445					 **Moses** and **Samuel** were great models and leaders who had prayed on behalf of the Lord’s people (*Exod 32:31-32*; *1 Sam 12:23*).\n\n
99:7	idm70455					 The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron from **the pillar of cloud** (*Exod 33:9*; *Num 12:5-6*), and for a time, the people responded to the revelation.\n\n
100:1	idm70464					 This psalm calls all nations to come to Jerusalem to worship the Lord and acknowledge his goodness to Israel.\n\n
100:3	idm70470					 **The** Lord is the one who determines who **his people** are. • **the sheep of his pasture:** God will guide and protect his people (*23:1*, *4*).\n\n
100:4	idm70482					 **Gates** and **courts** were part of the Temple in Jerusalem.\n\n
101:1	idm70490					 This hymn expresses a commitment to live with integrity and to avoid evil. Jesus meets this ideal.\n\n
101:2	idm70496					 **in my own home** (literally *in my house*): This commitment to **integrity** might refer to private life at home. Some interpreters view *my house* as referring to the king’s palace; the commitment would then refer to the policies of his administration. • Leading a **life of integrity** means choosing a wise lifestyle.\n\n
101:4	idm70507					 The psalmist hates what the Lord hates (*Prov 6:16-19*; see *Pss 5:5*; *11:4-5*). • **Perverse ideas** come from corrupt human hearts (cp. *18:26*).\n\n
101:6	idm70518					 The psalmist surrounds himself with people who are also committed to integrity (*101:2*).\n\n
101:7	idm70525					 The psalmist commits himself to ridding his **house** and **the city of the** Lord—representing the entire kingdom—of all evil.\n\n
102:1	idm70534					 A frail and afflicted human being prays for the Lord’s compassion on Jerusalem and for his presence with its inhabitants.\n\n
102:1	idm70540					 The psalmist appeals to the Lord not to **turn away** (or *hide your face*). Israel experienced his turning his face away during their exile.\n\n
102:3	idm70548					 **Smoke** is an image of transitory life (*37:20*; *68:2*). • The psalmist’s **bones** represent his whole being (see *6:2*; *34:19-22*).\n\n
102:4	idm70560					 **Like** dried **grass***,* the psalmist senses his life ebbing away.\n\n
102:5	idm70569					 **skin and bones:** The psalmist has wasted away because of his anguish (see *102:9*; *109:24*).\n\n
102:6	idm70578					 The **owl** was associated with ruin and desolation (*Isa 34:11*, *15*).\n\n
102:7	idm70587					 The psalmist cannot sleep (see *63:6-8*). Like a **bird on the roof***,* he feels isolated from both friends (see *88:8*) and **enemies**.\n\n
102:10	idm70598					 The psalmist blames the Lord for his troubles.\n\n
102:11	idm70604					 The psalmist’s existence seems empty and transitory (*102:4*; *109:23*; *144:4*).\n\n
102:12	idm70613					 The topic changes from the psalmist’s miseries to the Lord’s glory. A vision of the Lord’s compassionate kingship gives him confidence in Zion’s future.\n\n
102:12	idm70619					 **forever . . . to every generation:** The frailty of humans (*102:3-11*) contrasts with the permanence of the Lord.\n\n
102:13	idm70627					 **Now is the time** for the Lord to restore Jerusalem from exile (see *75:2*; *Jer 29:10*; *Dan 9:1-19*).\n\n
102:15	idm70637					 When the Lord arises (*102:13*), **the nations will tremble** with fear because they will see **his glory** (see *8:1*; *19:1-4a*; *24:7*). The rebuilding of Zion and the Temple portray God’s glory and fulfill this promise. An even greater fulfillment will come with the New Jerusalem (*Rev 21*).\n\n
102:17	idm70650					 The people of Israel were **destitute** (or *naked*) during the Exile.\n\n
102:18	idm70658					 The Lord will have mercy; Jews and Gentiles alike will worship him.\n\n
102:18	idm70664					 **Let this be recorded:** The written record stands as a memorial to the Lord’s goodness.\n\n
102:19	idm70671					 The **heavenly sanctuary** refers to God’s holy place on high (see *92:8-10*).\n\n
102:22	idm70679					 The **multitudes**—both Jews and Gentiles—will join in the worship of the Lord (see *96:7*, *9*; *106:48*; *Isa 2:2-4*; *43:10-13*; *57:15*; *60:3-7*).\n\n
102:23	idm70693					 Although the psalmist suffers in the present, he bases his hope for the future on the Lord’s past faithfulness.\n\n
102:24	idm70699					 The psalmist draws a contrast between his days (*102:23*) and God’s years (cp. *90:4*).\n\n
102:25	idm70707					 In contrast with the permanence of the Creator, the created order **will wear out like** a piece of **clothing** (see *Isa 40:28*). • The writer to the Hebrews describes this passage as having been addressed to Jesus, the Son (*Heb 1:10-12*).\n\n
102:28	idm70717					 The Lord’s **presence** provides the basis for the security and happiness of his **people** (*23:6*).\n\n
103:1	idm70726					 This psalm celebrates the Lord’s perfection, compassion, forgiveness, and goodness.\n\n
103:1	idm70732					 The psalmist offers praise for the Lord’s goodness.\n\n
103:1	idm70738					 **Let all that I am praise the** Lord**:** *Pss 103* and *104* each open and close with this commitment (*103:1-2*, *22*; *104:1*, *35*; see also *146:1*).\n\n
103:7	idm70754					 The Lord **revealed** himself **to Moses** in distinctive ways that ensured his relationship with his people (see *Exod 34:6-7*; *Num 14:18*).\n\n
103:9	idm70764					 If the Lord were to **constantly accuse** or **remain angry forever***,* no one would be left (see *Isa 54:7-8*; *57:16*).\n\n
103:11	idm70775					 The Lord’s **love** and forgiveness are infinite and complete.\n\n
103:13	idm70782					 **The** Lord** is like a father to his children:** This analogy forms the basis for Jesus’ teaching about God’s fatherhood (see *Matt 5:43-48*; *6:1*; *10:19-20*; *12:50*; *Luke 6:36*; *12:29-32*; *John 8:31-59*; *15:1-8*; see also *2 Sam 7:14*; *Jer 3:19*; *31:9*; *Mal 1:6*; *2 Cor 6:16-18*).\n\n
103:14	idm70804					 The Lord compassionately cares for frail humans (see *37:2*; *90:5*; *92:7*; *102:4*; *Isa 40:6-8*).\n\n
103:17	idm70815					 **the love of the** Lord** remains forever:** The Lord’s kingdom is everlasting, so he commits himself to his people across many generations.\n\n
103:18	idm70824					 To **obey** God means to be **faithful** and loyal to him.\n\n
103:20	idm70832					 The psalmist exhorts the Lord’s angels, his servants and messengers, to praise the Lord.\n\n
103:22	idm70838					 God’s **kingdom** extends over all things, so all things are called to praise the Lord. • The concluding phrase takes us back to *103:1-2*.\n\n
104:1	idm70846					 This creation hymn (see also *Pss 8*, *33*, *145*) exalts God’s goodness and majesty. The psalmist reflects on the present world, the original creation, and a future new creation. He sees both creations as marvelously and wisely made (cp. *139:14*), as the work of the Lord’s Spirit (*104:30*; *Gen 1:2*; *2 Cor 3:6*).\n\n
104:1	idm70859					 **Let all that I am praise the** Lord**:** *Pss 103* and *104* each open and close with this commitment to praise (*103:1-2*, *22*; *104:1*, *35*). • **how great you are!** This acclamation expresses praise for rescue (see also *35:27*; *40:16*; *70:4*).\n\n
104:2	idm70878					 The psalmist interacts with two of the days of creation (see *Gen 1:1-8*), when God created the heavens and light.\n\n
104:3	idm70885					 This poetic portrayal envisions **the clouds** as beams that support heaven.\n\n
104:4	idm70892					 Wind and lightning are seen as divine **messengers**. The Lord uses weather phenomena as he desires (*77:17-18*; *78:26*; *135:7*; *148:5-6*). • The psalmist interacts with day three of creation (*Gen 1:9-13*). The Lord is master of water and earth.\n\n
104:6	idm70904					 At first, **water** covered the earth.\n\n
104:7	idm70911					 The Lord created dry ground on day three of creation (*Gen 1:9-13*).\n\n
104:8	idm70918					 The earth originates in God’s will.\n\n
104:9	idm70924					 The Lord reigns over all bodies of water, including those on land. He replaced chaotic waters with order and abundance, and the earth became a splendid place for animals and humans, with water refreshing the ground, the birds, and the animals.\n\n
104:9	idm70930					 The Lord **set a firm boundary for the seas** to protect the land. God’s sovereignty over sea and land was an argument against the existence of Baal, whom the Canaanites celebrated as victorious over the waters (see *Ps 29*).\n\n
104:11	idm70938					 The psalmist celebrates animal, plant, and human life, as well as the Lord’s abundant provision for all of it (*Gen 1:9-30*).\n\n
104:14	idm70945					 **people to use:** People are the managers of the created order, and they receive nourishment from the work of their hands.\n\n
104:15	idm70952					 While both can be misused (cp. *Prov 21:17*), the Lord provides **wine** and **olive oil** as gifts to enhance life. Life is sustained by basic food, represented by **bread**.\n\n
104:17	idm70962					 The **storks** migrated from northern Europe and resided in Palestine during the winter. • **hyraxes:** These animals are about the size of a rabbit and live in rocky places.\n\n
104:19	idm70970					 The psalmist rejoices in the order of night and day, marking day four of creation (*Gen 1:14-19*). This cycle gives all creatures an opportunity to live.\n\n
104:19	idm70977					 **the moon to mark the seasons:** Ancient Israel based its calendar on the cycles of the moon. • **the sun knows when to set:** This is a poetic description from the perspective of normal observation. The sun goes down at a regular time every evening.\n\n
104:20	idm70985					 Cycles of **darkness** and **dawn** mark the days on earth.\n\n
104:24	idm70993					 The Lord’s works testify to his wisdom. All parts fit together—land and sea, night and day, land creatures and sea creatures. The Lord’s wisdom makes life orderly and wonderful.\n\n
104:25	idm70999					 The **ocean, . . . teeming with life of every kind** (see *Gen 1:20-21*), exemplifies the Lord’s creative activities.\n\n
104:26	idm71007					 **ships sailing:** Commercial vessels engaged in sea trade were one of the wonders of the ancient Near East (see *Isa 2:16*; *23:1*, *3*). • **Leviathan:** The psalmist says that this feared creature is nothing but the Lord’s pet.\n\n
104:27	idm71018					 All life depends on the gracious sustenance of the Lord of life and death (cp. *Matt 6:11*).\n\n
104:29	idm71025					 **When you give them your breath:** Life on earth is only possible as the Lord’s gift, symbolized by his breath (Hebrew *ruakh,* “breath, wind, spirit”). The Lord’s Spirit is the agent of renewal (*Isa 32:15-20*).\n\n
104:31	idm71034					 The psalmist moves from describing the known creation to anticipating the new creation, when the Lord will renew the created order into a world without sinners.\n\n
104:31	idm71040					 The Lord reveals his presence in the created order (see *8:1*; *19:1-4*; *24:7*) and takes **pleasure** in his new creation (see *Isa 65:19*).\n\n
104:32	idm71051					 The trembling **earth** and the smoking **mountains** represent the Lord’s coming in judgment against sinners and salvation for his faithful people (see *18:7-15*).\n\n
104:35	idm71060					 The Lord will remove all forms of evil that defile his creation. • The concluding phrase takes us back to *104:1* (see also *103:1-2*, *22*; *146:1*).\n\n
105:1	idm71070					 This hymn praises the Lord’s faithfulness to Abraham and his descendants in all their journeys—from Ur to Canaan (*105:12*), to Egypt (*105:17*, *23*), through the wilderness (*105:37*, *41*), and back to Canaan (*105:44*). All of this fulfilled the Lord’s promise to Abraham (*105:9*, *42*), which was the basis for Israel’s very existence. Joseph, whose suffering was changed into glory, is a paradigm of encouragement for Israel (*105:16-25*). • *Psalm 105:1-15* (along with 96; *106:1*, *47-48*) is included in David’s song of praise recorded in *1 Chr 16*.\n\n
105:1	idm71089					 The poet begins with the exhortation **Give thanks** (see also *106:1*; *107:1*; *118:1*; *136:1*). The other psalms continue with the refrain “for he is good!” The rest of *Ps 105* tells of God’s goodness.\n\n
105:6	idm71101					 The story of Israel is based on the Lord’s commitment to Abraham. Even when a question arises about the future of God’s covenant with David (*Ps 89*), God’s covenant with Abraham stands, as does the spiritual bond between God and Israel, Abraham’s descendants.\n\n
105:8	idm71108					 The **covenant** is the Lord’s irrevocable oath to be the Father of Abraham and his descendants (see *Gen 12:1-9*; *15:1-21*).\n\n
105:11	idm71117					 God promised **the land of Canaan** to Abraham’s descendants as their **special possession***,* where they could live as God’s people (*105:44-45*; *Gen 12:7*; *15:7-21*).\n\n
105:12	idm71129					 The Lord protected Israel’s patriarchs.\n\n
105:15	idm71135					 Abraham was one of the nation’s **prophets** (*Gen 20:7*).\n\n
105:16	idm71143					 These verses tell the story of Joseph (see *Gen 37–41*).\n\n
105:19	idm71150					 **tested Joseph’s character:** See *Gen 39:6-12*.\n\n
105:23	idm71158					 These verses tell the story of Israel’s affliction in Egypt (see *Exod 1:1-14*).\n\n
105:23	idm71165					 **Egypt** (Hebrew *mitsrayim*) is called **the land of Ham**.\n\n
105:26	idm71174					 The psalmist recounts the story of Moses and the plagues in Egypt (*Exod 7:20–12:30*).\n\n
105:37	idm71181					 The Exodus and the conquest of Canaan fulfilled God’s promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (*105:9-10*). Unlike *Ps 78*, the poet recites the Lord’s goodness without commenting on Israel’s history of rebellion (cp. *Ps 106*).\n\n
105:37	idm71190					 **not one . . . stumbled:** The Lord protected all of his people (cp. *9:3*).\n\n
105:39	idm71198					 The Lord’s presence was as evident to all as a **fire** in the **darkness** (*Exod 13:22*).\n\n
105:42	idm71207					 The story of redemption is also the story of the Lord’s faithfulness.\n\n
105:44	idm71213					 Canaan was a land of **pagan nations** (see *111:6*). The psalmist might also be reflecting on God’s promise to Abraham (*Gen 24:60*) regarding the lands given to Isaac (*Gen 26:3*).\n\n
105:45	idm71223					 The Lord planned for Israel to testify about him by obeying him; Israel was to be his model people.\n\n
106:1	idm71229					 The Israelite community in exile confessed the Lord’s goodness and justice and their own historic sinfulness. From the humble state of exile, they pleaded for redemption and restoration, asking to be gathered back from all the places the Lord had scattered them in his wrath. The psalm does not end in despair but with the memory of the Lord’s former mercy and the hope that his mercy will be renewed (*106:44-48*). Israel failed, but the Lord is constant. • Verses 1, *47-48* (along with *Pss 96*; *105:1-15*) are included in David’s song of praise recorded in *1 Chr 16:1-43*.\n\n
106:1	idm71240					 **Praise the** Lord**!** This refrain (Hebrew *haleluyah*) characterizes four small subgroups in the psalms: *104–106*, *111–113*, *115–117*, *146–150*.\n\n
106:2	idm71254					 Wise people who practice justice and righteousness receive encouragement to proclaim the Lord’s great acts.\n\n
106:4	idm71260					 The poet prays individually for the Lord’s favor before leading the community confession that follows.\n\n
106:6	idm71266					 The community joins together to confess their sins and their ancestors’ many acts of unbelief.\n\n
106:6	idm71272					 The story of Israel’s redemption encompasses their sinful response from the days of the **ancestors** to the present (*106:43*). The themes of sin and divine wrath both open and close Book Four (*90:1-9*; *106:6*, *23*, *43*).\n\n
106:9	idm71284					 **Red Sea:** See *Exod 14:15-31*.\n\n
106:13	idm71292					 **They wouldn’t wait:** God’s impatient people did not trust him to work according to his will (e.g., see *Exod 15:24*; *16:2-3*; *17:1-3*; *Num 14:26-45*; *21:4-9*).\n\n
106:15	idm71304					 **he sent a plague:** See *Exod 32:35*; *Num 11:33*.\n\n
106:16	idm71313					 The people became **jealous** because they presumed to have the same privileges as God’s appointed priests (see *Num 16:1-35*). • **the earth opened up:** See *Num 16:28-33*.\n\n
106:19	idm71323					 **they bowed before an image:** The people forgot their Savior and committed the sin of idolatry (see *Exod 32:1-6*).\n\n
106:22	idm71331					 **The land of Ham** here means Egypt (*106:21*).\n\n
106:24	idm71339					 The people disobeyed God’s command when they **refused to enter the pleasant land** (the Promised Land; see *Jer 3:19*). • **they wouldn’t believe his promise:** See *Num 13:25–14:12*.\n\n
106:26	idm71349					 God’s judgment when Israel refused to obey was death and exile (*Num 14:26-30*). The occasion for these severe judgments seems to have been disobeying God’s word (*Ps 106:24-25*) and provoking the Lord’s wrath (*106:28-46*).\n\n
106:28	idm71358					 Israel’s idolatry outside of the land came with them into the land. Their nature did not change; they continued to provoke the Lord to anger by their actions.\n\n
106:28	idm71364					 **the worship of Baal at Peor:** See *Num 25:3*; *Deut 4:3*.\n\n
106:30	idm71373					 **Phinehas**, who executed a flagrantly apostate Israelite man (*Num 25:3-8*), is an even better model of **a righteous** man than **Moses**, who failed **at Meribah** (*Num 20:11-13*).\n\n
106:34	idm71385					 Israel continued to disobey the word of the Lord while living in the Promised Land. Rather than destroying the nations, Israel accepted them and their ways (see *Judg 2:1-3*, *11-15*; *3:5-6*).\n\n
106:37	idm71394					 Pagan gods were **demons** (see *Deut 32:17*).\n\n
106:39	idm71402					 Idolatry, like **adultery***,* defiles God’s people (see *Lev 18:24*; *Hos 5:3*).\n\n
106:40	idm71412					 The psalmist returns to the Babylonian exile (*106:26-27*). The Lord judged Israel severely, but he also restrained his wrath, remembering the covenant he had made with Abraham.\n\n
106:40	idm71419					 God **abhorred** Israel’s sin, as he does all sin.\n\n
106:43	idm71426					 When Israel was **finally destroyed***,* the destruction was not complete. The Lord **pitied them***,* so he left a remnant.\n\n
106:45	idm71436					 **He remembered . . . and relented:** Unlike Israel, the Lord is faithful to his **covenant** (*105:8*).\n\n
106:46	idm71445					 As harsh as the Exile was, the Lord still protected his people (see *2 Kgs 25:27-29*).\n\n
106:47	idm71452					 **Gather us back:** The community prays for restoration from exile (see *102:19-22*; *107:3*; see also *Isa 11:12*; *40:11*; *43:5*; *54:7*; *56:8*; *66:18*).\n\n
106:48	idm71467					 This doxology concludes Book Four (cp. *41:13*; *89:52*). • **from everlasting to everlasting!** The reference to God’s eternal nature links to the opening of Book Four (*90:1-2*). • **Let all the people say, “Amen!”:** The Hebrew word *’amen* means “It is true.” The godly accept the Lord’s will in exile and his promise to be their God.\n\n
107:1	idm71479					 This psalm is a hymn of praise to God the Redeemer. After an introduction exhorting the redeemed to praise God for his goodness (*107:1-3*), the psalmist brings together four case studies of people whom the Lord redeemed from adversity (*107:4-32*). He then sums up the Lord’s sovereignty (*107:33-42*) and concludes with an invitation to discern God’s unfailing love in all areas of life (*107:43*).\n\n
107:2	idm71489					 The **redeemed** might be all who came out of exile.\n\n
107:3	idm71496					 **exiles:** People came from all nations where the people of Israel and Judah had been scattered.\n\n
107:4	idm71503					 Those who were lost in the **wilderness** thank God for his rescue. The wilderness might be a metaphor for leaving the path of wisdom (*1:1*; *Prov 4:10-15*).\n\n
107:6	idm71512					 The psalmist does not specify the occasion of his **trouble** and **distress**. The generic nature of the adversity permits readers in a variety of circumstances to identify with the laments.\n\n
107:7	idm71520					 God **led them** like a shepherd (see *23:1*). • Verse 8 is a refrain that is repeated in *107:15*, *21*, *31*.\n\n
107:10	idm71531					 The psalmist calls for thanksgiving and praise from people in despair over the consequences of their rebellion.\n\n
107:11	idm71537					 God’s **counsel** includes his instruction and will.\n\n
107:12	idm71544					 Exhausted by their **hard labor** (*Lam 5:13*), the people **fell**. While this might be expected of the wicked (*Pss 9:3*; *27:2*), it was unlike the Israelites’ flight from Egypt (*105:37*).\n\n
107:17	idm71556					 Fools who received what they deserved but were rescued from death offer thanksgiving to the Lord.\n\n
107:20	idm71562					 The Lord creates (*Gen 1:3*) and sustains the universe (*Heb 1:3*) simply by speaking (*Ps 147:18*); when he speaks, people are also **healed** (*Matt 8:8*).\n\n
107:23	idm71573					 Sailors give thanks to the Lord when he saves them from the chaos and peril of the sea.\n\n
107:25	idm71579					 The same God who speaks and brings about the sailors’ distress can also calm the storm with just a word (cp. *Jon 1:4*; *Matt 8:26*).\n\n
107:32	idm71587					 This call for public praise expands the refrains in *107:21-22* and *107:31*.\n\n
107:33	idm71595					 These two sections (*107:33-38*, *39-42*) expand the theme of the Lord’s sovereignty over things that humans cannot control.\n\n
107:33	idm71603					 The Lord can choose to make the earth fertile or barren (*74:15*; *Isa 35:6-7*).\n\n
107:38	idm71611					 God’s presence can be seen in the abundance of his people’s **families** and **herds** (*127:3*; *133:3*; cp. *109:8*).\n\n
107:39	idm71622					 People often **become impoverished** when their rulers practice **oppression**.\n\n
107:40	idm71630					 In his **contempt** for human rulers, the Lord rectifies their corruption on earth.\n\n
107:41	idm71637					 The large **families** of **the poor** are evidence of God’s blessing.\n\n
107:42	idm71645					 Justice prevails in God’s world (*1:6*), and Israel’s history demonstrates God’s faithful love.\n\n
108:1	idm71652					 This psalm combines two excerpts from David’s other psalms (cp. *57:5*, *7-11*; *60:5-12*).\n\n
109:1	idm71661					 The psalmist begins this lament with a general charge against his accusers: They do evil in return for good (*109:1-5*). At the end of the psalm, he turns to the Lord in prayer, asking for his protection (*109:21-25*) and vengeance (*109:26-31*).\n\n
109:1	idm71670					 The psalmist sees no evidence that God cares (see *28:1*).\n\n
109:4	idm71677					 The psalmist’s acts of kindness and godliness (see *35:12-14*) have only met with stubborn opposition and expressions of hatred.\n\n
109:6	idm71684					 The NLT translates these verses as the words of the psalmist’s accusers; Hebrew lacks **They say***,* which makes it unclear who is speaking.\n\n
109:8	idm71692					 Family members of those guilty of capital crimes often died with the perpetrator (*Num 16:1-33*; *Josh 7:1-25*) or had their property confiscated (*1 Kgs 21:13-16*).\n\n
109:8	idm71701					 The wicked person apparently held a **position** of leadership. Peter referred to this psalm in regard to Judas Iscariot (*Acts 1:20-26*).\n\n
109:13	idm71709					 If one’s **family name** was **blotted out***,* it meant there was no **offspring** to carry on the family name or remember its history (see *Prov 10:7*).\n\n
109:14	idm71720					 Children inherit the sinful nature of their parents (*51:5*; *Exod 20:5*; *Eph 2:3*). The speaker wants the Lord to punish the perpetrator for the guilt of family members who went before him (cp. *Matt 23:35-36*).\n\n
109:16	idm71730					 The defendant committed capital crimes and did not exercise even basic decency.\n\n
109:18	idm71736					 **Cursing** is the accused person’s whole way of life.\n\n
109:20	idm71743					 The psalmist appeals to the principle of retribution (see *94:23*).\n\n
109:21	idm71750					 Vulnerable and miserable, the psalmist appeals to his Lord for help. The accusations have killed his inner spirit and even his physical stamina.\n\n
109:21	idm71756					 The Lord’s **reputation** is at stake. If the wicked triumph, others could think that the Lord is also wicked and be drawn to that wickedness (*1:1*).\n\n
109:23	idm71764					 A **shadow at dusk** suggests a transitory, empty existence (*102:11*; *144:4*); a single **locust** could easily be **brushed off** one’s clothing.\n\n
109:26	idm71775					 These verses form a prayer for God’s presence and for vindication. The psalmist wants everyone to see that he is vindicated by the Lord, not by any human agent.\n\n
109:28	idm71781					 The Lord’s **servant** demonstrates loyalty and obedience.\n\n
109:29	idm71788					 The psalmist had been accused of being clothed with curses (*109:18*); now he asks that his accusers be **clothed with disgrace** and **humiliation**.\n\n
110:1	idm71797					 Jesus and the apostles cite this psalm to explain Jesus’ unique ministry and status as the Messiah (*Matt 22:43-45*; *Acts 2:32-36*). It reaffirms God’s covenant with David and gives hope for the future (see *2 Sam 7:8-16*).\n\n
110:1	idm71806					 The king of Israel had the great privilege of being the Lord’s adopted son (*Ps 2*; *1 Chr 22:10*), but he fell (*Ps 89*). This decree restores and heightens his position. • **The** Lord**:** Hebrew *Yahweh,* the name of God (see *Exod 3:6-14*; *6:2-8*; *20:2*). • **my Lord** (Hebrew *’adoni*) means “my master” or “my superior.” The psalmist viewed God’s messianic ruler as his superior. The New Testament frequently cites this psalm to validate Jesus’ claim to be the Messiah (*Matt 22:44-45*; *Mark 12:36-37*; *Luke 20:42-44*; *Acts 2:34-35*; *Heb 1:13*). • The Lord’s **right hand** represents his authority, strength, presence, and benefits. The Lord chose the descendant of David and raised him up to be close to him (*Ps 80:17*). Jesus claimed this position for himself (*Matt 26:64*; *Mark 14:62*; *16:19*; *Luke 22:69*), and the apostles announced that Jesus, having ascended to heaven, sits at the right hand of the Father (*Acts 2:33*; *5:31*; *7:55-56*; *Rom 8:34*; *Eph 1:20*; *Col 3:1*; *Heb 1:3*; *8:1*; *10:12*; *12:2*). • Ancient Near Eastern kings were sometimes portrayed as placing their feet on the backs of their conquered **enemies** as on a **footstool** (see *Heb 10:12-13*).\n\n
110:2	idm71848					 The **kingdom** will expand and increase, beginning from Jerusalem, until all enemies are conquered.\n\n
110:4	idm71855					 The Lord had made an unbreakable **oath** and covenant, so his apparent rejection of David’s dynasty (*89:38*) in the Exile had led to a crisis. The placement of *Ps 110* in Book Five reaffirms the future of the dynasty: David’s descendant must conform to God’s standard of integrity (*Ps 101*). His ministry will be transformed as he serves under God’s kingship (*Pss 93–100*). • **You are a priest forever:** The role of God’s messianic ruler changes. The priestly kingship of David and his descendants extended to serving as patrons of the Temple. David had the Ark brought to Jerusalem (*2 Sam 6:15*) and arranged for the Temple service (*1 Chr 6:31-48*; *15:11-26*; *16:4-42*; *23:4-32*; *25:1*). Solomon supervised the Temple construction (*1 Kgs 5:1–7:51*). Even so, Israel’s kingship was separate from its priesthood. In the messianic kingdom, the king would also minister as priest, as **Melchizedek***,* king of Salem (*Gen 14:18*), had done. The New Testament develops the ministry of Jesus Christ as a fulfillment of this new order (see *Heb 5:6-10*; *6:20–7:25*).\n\n
110:5	idm71879					 The new priestly role of David’s descendant does not rescind his old role as conquering ruler. He must still bring the nations under his rule (*110:2-3*; see *Ps 2*).\n\n
110:5	idm71887					 **at your right hand:** This position brings help and protection (see *16:7-8*; *108:13*). • The Lord **will strike down** rebellious **kings**. Rebellion against the Lord is a capital offense (*Ps 2*; *Rom 6:23*).\n\n
110:7	idm71900					 God’s messianic ruler obtains victory as a vigorous person, as if he had received nourishment **from brooks along the way** (*110:3*).\n\n
111:1	idm71908					 The refrain **Praise the** Lord**!** (Hebrew *haleluyah*) characterizes this group of psalms.\n\n
111:1	idm71918					 This wisdom psalm contains many references to the works of the Lord that reveal his character. God is righteous, gracious, compassionate, faithful, just, trustworthy, upright, holy, and awe-inspiring (*111:3*, *4*, *7*, *8*, *9*). God’s character gives hope in the covenant relationship (*111:5*). He rescued Israel from Egypt (*111:9*), gave them the land (*111:6*), and provides for his people (*111:5*). However, God demands that the beneficiaries of this relationship also be people of righteousness and integrity.\n\n
111:1	idm71933					 The godly praise God and delight themselves in his great works. His mighty acts reflect his righteousness, grace, and compassion (see *116:5-7*). All who submit themselves to him experience his glory.\n\n
111:5	idm71940					 God takes care of his people’s needs, even providing **food**. He **remembers his covenant** with Abraham (see *105:8-11*).\n\n
111:6	idm71949					 Giving Israel **the lands of other nations** was **just and good** because the Lord was executing his justice on those he dispossessed and showing grace to the Israelites. However, if the Israelites do not live **faithfully and with integrity***,* they will also be dispossessed. The Lord’s people must reflect his character.\n\n
111:9	idm71959					 The people of the Exodus generation went free because of God’s grace.\n\n
111:10	idm71965					 **True wisdom** is the source of life (*Prov 3:18*; *9:11*; *Eccl 7:12*); it begins with the **fear of the** Lord (*Prov 9:10*).\n\n
112:1	idm71978					 This psalm reiterates the themes of wisdom and the fear of the Lord (*Ps 111*). The wise have reason to be happy (*112:1-5*) and vigorous (*112:6-10*).\n\n
112:1	idm71987					 The fear of the Lord leads to a life of wisdom that honors God and blesses the family and community. The godly joyfully imitate God; their obedience is not slavish.\n\n
112:2	idm71993					 **successful:** All will know the **children** of **godly people** (see *127:4*) because the godly leave a legacy for their children (see *1:3*; cp. *Matt 6:20*).\n\n
112:4	idm72005					 The godly imitate God by being **generous, compassionate, and righteous** (*51:1*; *111:1-10*; *2 Cor 9:9*). They **lend money** to the poor without charging interest (*Pss 15:5*; *112:9*; *Exod 22:25*).\n\n
112:6	idm72019					 The honesty and compassion of the wise keeps them from stumbling (*15:5*; *37:23-24*), ensuring that they **will be long remembered** (*Prov 10:7*).\n\n
112:8	idm72029					 Because the godly joyfully expect God to prevail and rescue them, they **face their foes triumphantly** (*59:10*; *112:4*; *118:7*).\n\n
112:9	idm72039					 Paul quotes this verse in his instructions about generous giving (*2 Cor 9:9*).\n\n
112:10	idm72046					 The **wicked . . . grind their teeth in anger** out of their bitter envy (*35:16*; *37:12*). The vigor and reputation of the godly cause conflict with those who want them dead. • The wicked **will slink away** out of fear and shame.\n\n
113:1	idm72056					 These psalms form what is known as the “Egyptian Hallel” (*hallel* means “praise”) because Jews use the collection in the celebration of Passover, which was instituted at the beginning of the exodus from Egypt. *Psalms 113–114* are recited before the Passover meal and *Pss 115–118* afterward.\n\n
113:1	idm72065					 This hymn of praise exalts the greatness of the Lord’s name and glory. God is greatly exalted and glorious in heaven (*113:4*); he also stoops down to take care of the lowly and needy on earth (*113:5-9*).\n\n
113:1	idm72073					 **The name of the** Lord (Hebrew *Yahweh;* see *Exod 3:15*) reveals his being, character, and reputation. He is exalted in time (**now and forever**) and in space (**from east to west**).\n\n
113:4	idm72085					 The Lord’s glory reaches to the **heavens** (*57:5*, *11*; *99:2*; *108:5*; *138:6*; *Isa 6:1*; *57:15*) and throughout the world of human relationships.\n\n
113:5	idm72099					 The incomparable Lord intimately involves himself in caring for people on earth.\n\n
113:6	idm72105					 The Lord **stoops** to the world’s level to be directly involved with his people (see *138:6*; *Phil 2:6-8*).\n\n
113:7	idm72114					 These phrases are a quotation from Hannah’s prayer of praise (*1 Sam 2:8-9a*).\n\n
113:9	idm72121					 A **childless woman** was customarily treated with disdain (*Gen 16:4*); the Lord has the power to make her **a happy mother***,* as he made Sarah (*Gen 21:2*), Rebekah (*Gen 25:21*), Rachel (*Gen 30:23*), and Hannah (*1 Sam 1:20*). • God’s greatness and goodness provide ample reason to **praise** him.\n\n
114:1	idm72136					 This lyrical celebration of the Lord’s power in nature recalls Israel’s beginning as a nation at the Exodus (*114:1-2*) and upon their entry to the Promised Land (*114:3-6*). It promotes reverence for the God of Jacob (*114:7-8*).\n\n
114:1	idm72145					 At the time of Israel’s exodus from Egypt and their entrance into the Promised Land, Israel was one holy **kingdom** (*Exod 19:5-6*). • The separate references to **the land of Judah** and **Israel** indicate that the psalm was composed after the kingdom was divided (*1 Kgs 12:16-17*; cp. *1 Sam 11:8*; *1 Kgs 1:35*), and probably after the Exile. The **land of Judah became God’s sanctuary** because the people worshiped God; his Tabernacle and later his Temple were located there.\n\n
114:3	idm72159					 **hurried out of their way!** The waters divided for Israel to escape Egypt (*77:17-18*; *Exod 14*). • **The Jordan River turned away** when Israel arrived to cross over (see *Josh 3*). • **skipped like rams:** God’s presence caused the mountains to quake (*Exod 19:16-20*).\n\n
114:8	idm72172					 The Lord miraculously provided for his people in hard times after the Exile, just as he had done in the wilderness after the Exodus.\n\n
115:1	idm72178					 In this hymn of thanksgiving for God’s blessings, the community ascribes all glory to the name of the Lord, who is the true source of hope and blessing. Meanwhile, those who trust in idols are greatly disappointed. The blessing of the Creator of heaven and earth extends to future generations (*115:14*), and especially to the priesthood (*115:12*).\n\n
115:1	idm72186					 The community confesses their faith that God will rescue them for the glory of his name.\n\n
115:2	idm72192					 **Where is their God?** People deny God’s presence or power when he does not act as they think he should (cp. *14:1*; *42:3*, *10*). However, **God is in the heavens**—he has all power, authority, and knowledge. He **does as he wishes***,* not what people think he should do. He works out his plans in accord with his will (*Eph 1:11*) and acts in his own time and in ways he chooses.\n\n
115:4	idm72206					 This entire section is repeated in *135:15-20*. • Unlike the Lord (*95:3-5*), **idols** cannot do anything; they are good for nothing.\n\n
115:8	idm72215					 Worshiping idols leads one astray and corrupts those **who trust in them** (*Isa 44:20*).\n\n
115:9	idm72223					 **Israel . . . priests . . . you who fear the** Lord**:** The psalmist calls on all those in the God-fearing community to commit their ways to the living God. The threefold address assures them that the Lord is their true **helper** and **shield** (cp. *118:2-4*).\n\n
115:12	idm72235					 The groups named in *115:9-11* receive assurance of the Lord’s blessing, regardless of their social status (see *113:8*).\n\n
115:14	idm72243					 The psalmist blesses (*107:37-38*, *41*) all who trust in and fear the Lord. The Creator will care for the families of those who fear him. • **who made heaven and earth:** This statement speaks of the Lord’s all-encompassing power in creation.\n\n
115:16	idm72252					 **The heavens belong to the** Lord**:’s:** God’s exaltation begins in heaven (*113:4*), far above the gods of the nations. Of course, the earth also belongs to him (*47:9*; *95:4*). • The **dead** cannot participate in God’s blessings. The living **praise** God in thanksgiving for his blessings (*79:13*).\n\n
116:1	idm72267					 This hymn of thanksgiving rejoices in God’s character and in rescue from death (*116:1-11*). It gives an assurance of God’s protection in life and reminds the godly that the Lord watches over them even at death. The psalmist commits to living as God’s servant and resolves to honor him publicly (*116:12-19*).\n\n
116:1	idm72275					 The psalmist praises the Lord for answering his prayers and rescuing him from death.\n\n
116:1	idm72281					 **I love the** Lord**:** This unique opening expresses affection for and commitment to the Lord (see *18:1*; *Deut 6:5*) on the basis of what the Lord has done.\n\n
116:2	idm72292					 Because the Lord responds to the cry of his people (*107:41*; *113:6-8*), the psalmist now strongly believes in prayer.\n\n
116:3	idm72300					 It isn’t clear if the psalmist’s crisis was a literal near-death experience or if he was using the term figuratively.\n\n
116:4	idm72306					 This is the first of three times that the psalmist calls on the Lord’s **name** (i.e., reputation).\n\n
116:5	idm72313					 The gracious, righteous, and compassionate Lord (see *111:1-5*) rescued and gave rest to the psalmist.\n\n
116:6	idm72320					 People with **childlike faith** readily receive his wisdom and instruction (*19:7-11*; *Matt 18:3-4*).\n\n
116:8	idm72329					 The psalmist’s near-death crisis made him more aware of life and of walking before the Lord. Though he had been in anguish, the Lord was faithful. However, **people are all liars**.\n\n
116:9	idm72336					 **I walk in the** Lord**’s presence:** The psalmist already lived with integrity, but since his experience of deep distress, he now enjoys open fellowship with the Lord (see *56:13*; cp. *Job 42:5*).\n\n
116:10	idm72347					 **I believed in you:** Paul quotes this phrase in *2 Cor 4:13*.\n\n
116:12	idm72355					 The Lord’s gracious gifts are so great that the psalmist can do nothing to repay his debt. Keeping his promises publicly demonstrates his gratitude. • **All he has done for** the psalmist includes answers to prayer, rescue, and life. • The **cup of salvation** overflows with God’s blessings (*23:5*), unlike the cup of judgment (*75:8*). • The psalmist makes **promises** (“vows,” *116:18*) to praise the Lord publicly (*116:17-18*).\n\n
116:15	idm72368					 No one lives or dies outside of God’s will. Having been given a second chance at life, the poet readily commits himself to the Lord with renewed acts of public devotion.\n\n
117:1	idm72374					 This psalm, the shortest in the Psalter, invites **all . . . people of the earth** to **praise the** Lord because of his **unfailing love** and enduring **faithfulness**.\n\n
117:1	idm72385					 Paul quotes this verse to show that Gentiles would eventually praise the God of Israel (*Rom 15:11*).\n\n
118:1	idm72392					 With an exultant testimony, the psalmist gives thanks for the Lord’s goodness and encourages others to trust in his faithful love (*118:1-4*, *29*). This poem is the last of the Egyptian Hallel (*Pss 113–118*).\n\n
118:2	idm72401					 **Israel . . . Aaron’s descendants . . . all who fear the** Lord**:** These three groups represent the whole of the covenant community (cp. *115:9-11*; *135:19-20*).\n\n
118:5	idm72412					 The Lord alone is the psalmist’s helper.\n\n
118:6	idm72418					 **The** Lord** is for me:** Cp. *Rom 8:31*; *Heb 13:6*. • God’s presence cancels out the need to fear **mere people** (*Ps 56:11*). The psalmist joyfully expects God’s rescue (*59:10*; *112:8*).\n\n
118:8	idm72433					 Trusting in the Lord is better than placing confidence in even the most powerful human leaders (*118:6*; *146:3*).\n\n
118:10	idm72441					 Strength comes in the name of the Lord, declared by the threefold mention of the attackers, the Lord’s name, and victory. • Even when hostile people **blazed . . . like a crackling fire***,* the Lord caused them to subside like burning thorns (see *Isa 9:18*; *10:17*).\n\n
118:14	idm72451					 The psalmist celebrates the victory of the Lord’s **strong right arm***,* which kept him from death.\n\n
118:17	idm72459					 God has restored the psalmist from death to life, so he praises the Lord publicly (cp. *116:6*, *12-19*).\n\n
118:22	idm72467					 The psalmist sees his own salvation as the beginning of a new day in which the Lord will do great things.\n\n
118:22	idm72473					 The **cornerstone** (or *keystone*) of a building or an arch gives the structure its shape and foundation. It is the most important of all the stones. The Lord chooses and places this stone for his sanctuary (*Isa 28:16*). Jesus referred to himself as this cornerstone (*Matt 21:42*; *Mark 12:10-11*; *Luke 20:17*; see *Acts 4:11*; *Eph 2:20*; *1 Pet 2:6-7*).\n\n
118:24	idm72488					 **This is the day the** Lord** has made:** The day of the Lord’s victory has already arrived, although its completion awaits another day (*118:25*).\n\n
118:25	idm72498					 The psalmist concludes with prayer and thanksgiving, anticipating an even greater revelation of God’s victory and rescue.\n\n
118:26	idm72504					 The **one who comes in the name of the** Lord brings the Lord’s complete victory (see *118:10-12*). • During Jesus’ triumphant entry into Jerusalem, the crowds called out various blessings, including phrases taken from this verse (*Matt 21:9*; *Mark 11:9*; *Luke 19:38*; *John 12:13*). Jesus himself quoted this passage as he wept over Jerusalem (*Matt 23:39*; *Luke 13:35*).\n\n
119:1	idm72519					 This psalm combines elements of wisdom, lament, praise, thanksgiving, and confession. Eight Hebrew words are used frequently, translated as “instructions,” “laws,” “words,” “regulations,” “statutes,” “commands,” “decrees,” “commandments,” and “promises.” Together, these words encourage love for and obedience to God’s instructions, as found in the Scriptures (see *2 Tim 3:14-17*). The expression of deep commitment to these instructions unifies the psalm.\n\n
119:1	idm72526					 *Aleph* (א): God, the author of these **instructions***,* commands that his followers live by them. The psalmist prays to be given the grace to live by that revelation.\n\n
119:1	idm72536					 The wise are happy. They are **people of integrity** (see *84:11*) who **follow** the path of divine instruction. They **obey** God’s revelation and **search** for it **with all their hearts** (see *27:7*; *119:10*, *45*, *94*, *155*), and they reject all forms of evil. Cp. *1:1-2*.\n\n
119:4	idm72554					 To **keep** God’s **commandments** means to guard them by obeying them.\n\n
119:9	idm72562					 *Beth* (ב): The psalmist is determined to pursue purity and encourages the cultivation of wisdom through God’s principles (*119:9*) and instructions (*119:10-16*).\n\n
119:9	idm72572					 A **young person** tends toward foolishness (*Prov 22:15*) and can easily make mistakes that destroy his life (*Prov 7:6-23*). Youth is also the best time to develop personal discipline and pursue wisdom (see *Ps 34:11*; *Prov 1:4*). • To **stay pure** means to remain uncorrupted by wickedness and sin and to develop the integrity of life defined in *Ps 15*.\n\n
119:10	idm72585					 The student asks God the teacher to discipline him so that he will not **wander**.\n\n
119:14	idm72592					 God’s wisdom is far greater than any **riches** humans seek (*119:72*, *127*; *Prov 3:14-15*).\n\n
119:15	idm72602					 The way of wisdom includes meditating on God’s **ways** (see *119:1*, *3*). The wise reflect on the implications of God’s word.\n\n
119:17	idm72611					 *Gimel* (ג): Like a **foreigner** in hostile territory, God’s **servant** needs God’s guidance.\n\n
119:17	idm72621					 The psalmist seeks to please the Lord with a full and obedient life of praise (*118:17*; *119:25*, *77*, *116*, *144*, *175*). Only the Lord can remove his adversaries and enable him to **see** the wonderful truths found in God’s instructions.\n\n
119:20	idm72634					 The **arrogant** are probably those who mock the psalmist (*119:22-23*).\n\n
119:23	idm72642					 Those who **meditate** on God’s instructions receive **wise advice** from them.\n\n
119:25	idm72650					 *Daleth* (ד): Though the poet feels anguish and sorrow, he entreats the Lord to revive him because he wants to obey the Lord. Suffering and death may result from the Lord’s chastening (*118:17-18*; *119:67*, *71*, *75*), but his instruction revives the weary soul (see *119:12*).\n\n
119:29	idm72663					 **lying to myself:** Self-deception is a fruit of sinful human nature (*Jer 17:9*); it leads to folly. • Access to God’s word is a **privilege**, not a right.\n\n
119:33	idm72672					 *He* (ה): As a student, the poet asks his teacher, God, to renew life and to transform disgrace into righteousness.\n\n
119:36	idm72680					 The **love for money** can lead to sin (cp. *Exod 18:21*; *1 Tim 3:1-5*; *6:10*).\n\n
119:41	idm72690					 *Waw* (ו): The psalmist prays that God’s word would continue to be the source of his **love** and **salvation**.\n\n
119:41	idm72700					 The psalmist asks to be saved from enemies who speak harshly (see *42:10*; *44:16*; *89:50-51*; *102:8*).\n\n
119:44	idm72710					 The psalmist is determined to obey the Lord.\n\n
119:47	idm72716					 The psalmist finds **delight** in God’s word in spite of pain (*119:92*, *143*).\n\n
119:49	idm72725					 *Zayin* (ז): The psalmist asks God to **remember** his word as the psalmist also remembers God’s word and his name. Remembrance expresses devotion.\n\n
119:52	idm72734					 The **age-old regulations** are the Torah (God’s “instructions” or “law”), a term that refers to the books of Genesis—Deuteronomy.\n\n
119:57	idm72741					 *Heth* (ח): The psalmist seeks God’s favor and **unfailing love**. Although surrounded by evildoers, he remains a loyal servant of the Lord.\n\n
119:61	idm72750					 **Evil people try to drag** him** into sin***,* but the psalmist’s memory of God’s word keeps him standing firm (see *119:16*).\n\n
119:64	idm72760					 God’s goodness **fills the earth***;* the whole created order provides evidence of his goodness (see *Isa 6:3*; *11:9*).\n\n
119:65	idm72770					 *Teth* (ט): The psalmist describes himself as a penitent sinner who gratefully accepts the Lord’s discipline.\n\n
119:65	idm72778					 **Good judgment and knowledge** come from wisdom (*111:10*). • The psalmist admits that he **used to wander off** like a stray sheep (*119:176*). • **you disciplined me:** See *119:25-29*. • **You are good and do only good:** God’s character is perfect (*97:2*; *Jas 1:17*; *1 Jn 1:5*).\n\n
119:73	idm72794					 *Yodh* (י): In this prayer for comfort and compassion, the psalmist commits himself to his Creator, who has afflicted him. He wants God to pay back his enemies for the wrongs they have done. He also prays to receive the gift of life. He not only prays for himself but also considers the whole community of the godly, asking that God’s answers to prayer would encourage them.\n\n
119:73	idm72802					 As God’s child, the psalmist asks for divine wisdom.\n\n
119:81	idm72808					 *Kaph* (כ): The psalmist is **worn out** from **waiting** for the Lord, but his **hope** is in God’s future **rescue**.\n\n
119:85	idm72820					 God’s word is **trustworthy***,* in contrast to the deceptions of the enemies **who hunt** the psalmist **down without cause** (see *119:78*).\n\n
119:89	idm72831					 *Lamedh* (ל): The stability of God’s wisdom gives understanding. God’s word provides order and a framework for living, even when under pressure from adversaries.\n\n
119:95	idm72839					 The **wicked** intended to **kill** the psalmist, but destruction (*1:6*) was their own fate.\n\n
119:96	idm72848					 **Even perfection has its limits:** Humans cannot fully understand God’s ways (see *Eccl 3:11*).\n\n
119:97	idm72856					 *Mem* (מ): The instruction and wisdom of God through his word are far superior to the best that human teachers can offer.\n\n
119:97	idm72864					 **make me wiser:** God’s word provides wisdom and perspective. God is the true source of wisdom.\n\n
119:103	idm72871					 Wisdom is preferable to even the finest food (*19:10*; *81:16*). • The psalmist had already rejected the delusion offered by the way of folly (see *119:18*, *78*, *86*, *163*).\n\n
119:105	idm72883					 *Nun* (נ): The psalmist’s devotion to God’s word comes from within his being (*119:112*) and guides his external life.\n\n
119:105	idm72892					 The Lord’s **word is a lamp** that provides perspective, hope, and guidance in darkness (*18:25-29*; *119:130*). Even more, this **light** gives life (*Prov 6:23*).\n\n
119:108	idm72903					 **offering of praise:** This Hebrew expression is unique in the Old Testament (cp. *50:23*). • The psalmist is vulnerable to his opponents because of his commitment to a wise life.\n\n
119:113	idm72911					 *Samekh* (ס): The psalmist declares his hatred of evil and his love for God and his ways.\n\n
119:113	idm72919					 The godly hate the wicked and their deeds (*5:4-6*; cp. *Ezek 33:11*).\n\n
119:121	idm72927					 *Ayin* (ע): The servant of the Lord strains to endure the evil around him. He boldly petitions the Lord to rescue him immediately!\n\n
119:125	idm72935					 Simply possessing God’s law does not provide any benefits. The psalmist knows that only as the Lord gives **discernment** will he **understand** it.\n\n
119:129	idm72943					 *Pe* (פ): The psalmist prays earnestly for God to speak to him as he suffers from his adversities.\n\n
119:137	idm72951					 *Tsadhe* (צ): God is righteous, and his word is right and just, especially in contrast to the deceptions of the wicked.\n\n
119:139	idm72959					 The psalmist’s **indignation** (cp. *69:9*) comes from seeing the wicked disregard God’s word.\n\n
119:141	idm72967					 The psalmist is greatly troubled by his oppressors (see *119:143*; cp. *Isa 53*).\n\n
119:145	idm72975					 *Qoph* (ק): The psalmist prays to the Lord at night. Although God appears to be distant, he is nearby.\n\n
119:145	idm72983					 **I pray** and **I cry out** translate the same Hebrew verb. • **I rise early** and **I stay awake** translate the same Hebrew verb.\n\n
119:150	idm72993					 **Coming to attack me** (or *are coming near to me*) is a Hebrew wordplay on **but you are near**. The wicked remain far from God’s instructions, whereas the psalmist stays near, so he does not need to fear.\n\n
119:153	idm73002					 *Resh* (ר): This petition for **life** can be found throughout *Ps 119*, but it is concentrated in this stanza.\n\n
119:161	idm73012					 *Shin* (ש): The psalmist looks beyond his adversaries to the peace of God. This perspective allows him to praise God throughout the day.\n\n
119:161	idm73020					 **my heart trembles . . . I rejoice:** Fear, trembling, and joy mark the psalmist’s devotion to God. • God’s word is a **treasure**. • In the Old Testament, **seven** signifies wholeness.\n\n
119:169	idm73029					 *Taw* (ת): God’s servant petitions the Lord one final time; he still feels like a lost sheep.\n\n
119:176	idm73037					 God, the Great Shepherd, seeks out his **lost sheep** (*23:1*; *Luke 15:4-6*).\n\n
120:1	idm73046					 These short, appealing songs were sung during pilgrims’ journeys to Jerusalem for the national festivals three times per year (*Deut 16:16*). The title of these psalms includes the Hebrew word for stairs, which some take to mean “ascending to Jerusalem.” These psalms (sometimes called the Songs of Ascents) take the reader on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to praise God for his goodness to Israel throughout history.\n\n
120:1	idm73053					 This short, individual lament expresses the psalmist’s trust that the Lord will deal with deceptive evildoers. It also laments living as a stranger among hateful liars. The psalmist’s picture of his life in a foreign land might have been a reality as he set out for Jerusalem, or it might depict his feelings and concerns as he begins his pilgrimage. Overwhelmed with injustice, he trusts God and looks forward to arriving in the Lord’s presence.\n\n
120:1	idm73059					 The psalmist is surrounded by **liars***,* so he makes his lament **to the** Lord*,* the only one who can help him.\n\n
120:3	idm73070					 The psalmist dialogues with the liars who surround him. He feels reassured that the Lord will judge them. • The Divine Warrior (see *7:12-13*; *11:4-6*) will throw **sharp arrows** and **glowing coals** on the liars.\n\n
120:5	idm73080					 The psalmist feels the anguish of alienation, isolation, and perpetual conflict.\n\n
120:5	idm73086					 **Meshech** was a Japhethite territory far to the north of Canaan. **Kedar** was an Ishmaelite territory in Arabia. Violent people lived in both locations. Meshech was the home of a famous slave trade (*Ezek 27:13*; cp. *Exod 21:16*) and Kedar of renowned warriors (*Isa 21:16-17*). These places can be understood as representative of the apostate, violent land where the psalmist suffered.\n\n
120:6	idm73097					 **peace:** See *37:11*; *122:6-9*; *125:5*; *128:6*.\n\n
121:1	idm73108					 The leader of the group of pilgrims uses word pictures to assure the group of the Lord’s presence during the journey.\n\n
121:1	idm73114					 **The mountains** were known for their idolatrous worship (*Deut 12:2*), and Israel was enticed to the hilltop shrines (*Hos 4:13*). This verse can be understood as a rhetorical question expecting a negative answer: The gods of the hilltop shrines cannot rescue anyone. Others understand the mountains to be a symbol of the Lord’s strength (*Ps 95:4*). In that case, the question would be interpreted literally (*Where does my help come from?*), with the answer given in the next verse\n\n
121:4	idm73125					 The Creator (*121:2*) is the guardian of Israel. • God **stands beside** Israel, supporting and caring for the godly (see *16:7-8*). • Both the **sun** and the **moon** were regarded as deities in the ancient Near East, but the Creator limits their power. They, too, praise the Lord (*148:3*).\n\n
121:4	idm73137					 God **watches over** his own, even and especially when they face many troubles (*12:5*, *7*; *69:29*; *91:14*; *146:9*).\n\n
122:1	idm73149					 Jerusalem is here idealized as the city of God, the city of David, and the city of faith. A group of people on a pilgrimage joyfully arrive in the city (*122:1-2*). The psalmist sings an ode to Jerusalem (*122:3-5*) and prays for the city’s peace (*122:6-9*).\n\n
122:1	idm73158					 The central sanctuary was the **house of the** Lord. This phrase originally referred to the Tabernacle (*Exod 23:19*; *34:26*).\n\n
122:2	idm73168					 Several psalms celebrate or look forward to being **inside** the **gates** of the city (*9:14*; *87:2*; *100:4*; *118:19*).\n\n
122:3	idm73180					 Jerusalem is a metaphor for God’s heavenly dwelling. David was the archetype for God’s chosen rulers.\n\n
122:3	idm73186					 In the time of David and Solomon, **Jerusalem** was renowned as a place of security (*1 Kgs 10:6-7*).\n\n
122:4	idm73194					 Each of the people of **Israel** belonged to one of the tribes, and all of the **tribes** belonged to the Lord. • To **give thanks** is to present an offering acceptable to the Lord (*50:14*, *23*; *100:4*; *118:19*). • **as the law requires of Israel:** See *Exod 23:17*; *Deut 16:16*.\n\n
122:5	idm73210					 **the thrones where judgment is given:** In the eras of **David** and Solomon (*1 Kgs 3:28*), Jerusalem was the home of wisdom and justice; it would be so again (*Isa 9:7*).\n\n
122:6	idm73220					 Prayers for the **peace** of Jerusalem are motivated by love of family and God’s sanctuary.\n\n
123:1	idm73227					 This lament on the psalmist’s lowly position expresses vivid trust in the Lord (*123:1-2*). The psalmist prays for God’s favor on the community, as the reality of evil surrounds them (*123:3-4*). The poet looks beyond Jerusalem (*Ps 122*) to God’s throne **in heaven.**\n\n
124:1	idm73237					 This thanksgiving song describes what might happen if the Lord were not present with his people.\n\n
124:1	idm73243					 The negative rhetorical questions emphasize the positive idea that the Lord was indeed on their side.\n\n
124:4	idm73250					 **the raging waters of their fury:** The enemies could have **overwhelmed** the Israelites and wiped them out if the Lord had not been with his people (cp. *69:15*; *Jer 46:8*).\n\n
124:6	idm73260					 The enemies of God’s people, like lions or bears who **tear** their prey with their **teeth** (see *57:4*; *Prov 28:15*), had their mouths shut by the Lord (*Dan 6:22*).\n\n
125:1	idm73271					 The psalmist expresses the community’s confidence in the Lord’s protection (*125:1-2*) and prays for peace (*125:3-5*).\n\n
125:2	idm73279					 **surrounds:** God guards and protects like a wall of fire (*Zech 2:5*).\n\n
125:3	idm73287					 The **godly might be tempted** through peer pressure and cultural domination.\n\n
125:4	idm73294					 People who reject the straight path of the upright are fools (*Prov 2:12-15*). God pours out his goodness on the godly (see *Ps 122:6-9*).\n\n
126:1	idm73302					 This hymn celebrates Israel’s return from exile (*126:1-3*). The psalmist prays for full restoration (*126:4-6*).\n\n
126:1	idm73310					 The Lord brought about Israel’s restoration from exile, just as he had brought Israel out of Egypt (*114:1*). The restoration transformed the weeping of the Lord’s people into **laughter** and showed the Lord’s character to the **nations** (*9:11*; *64:9*; *Isa 12:4*).\n\n
126:4	idm73322					 The prophets had spoken of the restoration as a time when the wilderness would change into the Garden of Eden (*Isa 51:3*; *Ezek 47*); the reality fell far short of paradise. Here the restoration community prays for full redemption (see *Hag 2:19*). • **as streams renew the desert:** The seasonal rains filled the dry river beds (*wadis*), and the land turned green again. The prayer looks for a similar transformation of Israel’s **fortunes***,* a fulfillment of the imagery of the “Second Exodus” in Isaiah (see “*The Promise of a Second Exodus*” Theme Note). • The **harvest** represents God’s full restoration.\n\n
127:1	idm73337					 Blessing and protection come from God. Without his presence, there is no success (*127:1-2*). This is particularly true for children, who are God’s gift (*127:3-5*).\n\n
127:1	idm73345					 **Unless:** These conditional sentences emphasize the positive idea that the Lord will protect the city (cp. *124:1-2*). • Human effort is futile unless the Lord blesses it (see *44:3*). • **from early morning until late at night:** This depicts an aggressive and competitive lifestyle. • God’s **loved ones** enjoy a quiet night’s sleep (*3:5*; *4:8*).\n\n
127:3	idm73358					 **Children** are one of God’s blessings. The words translated “children” (Hebrew *banim*) and “builders” (*bonim**,* *127:1*) form a wordplay. Having children builds a family.\n\n
127:4	idm73369					 **like arrows:** God uses children to protect the reputation of his people against the wicked (cp. *120:4*; *7:12-13*).\n\n
128:1	idm73378					 The godly, who fear the Lord, will know true happiness (*128:1-2*). The Lord is with them (see *127:1-2*), building their home life (*128:3-4*) and blessing them across the generations (*128:5-6*).\n\n
128:1	idm73388					 Enjoying **the fruit** of one’s **labor** means gaining benefit from whatever work one does.\n\n
128:3	idm73396					 Like **vigorous young olive trees***,* children are saplings filled with potential. Olive oil symbolizes God’s blessing (*104:15*; *Num 18:12*; *Jer 31:12*; *Hag 2:19*).\n\n
128:4	idm73408					 God will **continually bless** all who fear him (*133:3*) from his dwelling in **Zion** (*20:2*; *50:2*; *110:2*), no matter where they live. • **grandchildren:** God’s blessings extend from generation to generation for the faithful (*79:12-13*; *89:1*; *100:4-5*; *103:17-19*).\n\n
129:1	idm73425					 The psalmist briefly reviews Israel’s history of trouble (*129:1-2*) and redemption (*129:3-4*). He concludes with curses against the enemies and blessings on the godly (*129:5-6*).\n\n
129:1	idm73434					 Israel’s **earliest youth** as a nation was during its sojourn in Egypt.\n\n
129:3	idm73441					 **the** Lord** is good:** He rescued Israel from Egypt, from many enemy attacks, and from the Babylonian exile.\n\n
129:6	idm73450					 **Grass on a rooftop** had shallow roots and would scorch easily. A crop was **ignored by the harvester** when the yield was low. The enemies who had sown hurt among God’s people would gain little.\n\n
130:1	idm73458					 Beginning with himself as a representative of the community, the psalmist cries for God’s mercy (*130:1-3*) out of deep distress. He places his hope in the Lord (*130:4-6*), knowing that the Lord will rescue when and as he chooses. Based on this confidence, the psalmist invites Israel to wait for the Lord (*130:7-8*).\n\n
130:1	idm73467					 A **cry** from **the depths** is from a place of deep distress (cp. *69:2*, *14*; *Isa 51:10*; *Ezek 27:34*). Out of the frailty of his being, the psalmist prays for divine favor.\n\n
130:3	idm73479					 The psalmist knows that his **sins** make him guilty and deserving of God’s judgment.\n\n
130:4	idm73486					 The good news comes in God’s readiness to forgive sinners. His grace encourages people to fear him and hope in him.\n\n
130:5	idm73492					 God’s **word** imparts **hope** (*119:42-43*, *49*; *147:11*).\n\n
130:7	idm73503					 **Israel** is invited to **hope in the **Lord (*9:18*; *27:14*; *131:3*) because the Lord pays the costly price for **redemption** and covers whatever **sin** separates humans from him (see also *111:9*; *Exod 6:6-8*; *2 Sam 7:23-24*; *Isa 43:1-4*; *Titus 2:14*; *Heb 9:12*; *1 Pet 1:18*).\n\n
131:1	idm73524					 Out of his contentment in the Lord, the psalmist invites Israel to seek their rest in God (*131:3*).\n\n
131:1	idm73531					 The **heart** represents the whole being (see *27:8*). • God hates arrogance, which is a foolish way of life (*Prov 6:16-19*). • The psalmist does not trouble himself with matters that properly belong to the Lord.\n\n
131:2	idm73540					 The psalmist **calmed and quieted** himself, surrendering his ambitions and taming his ego (*Gal 2:20*). • **like a weaned child:** The psalmist sees himself as a contented child.\n\n
132:1	idm73549					 This psalm celebrates the Lord’s faithfulness to David. When David wanted to bring the Ark into Jerusalem (*132:1-5*), the Lord granted the request and made Jerusalem his earthly home (*132:6-10*). The choice of Jerusalem marked God’s election of David’s line (*132:11-13*), of Zion (*132:14-17*), and of the priesthood (*132:9*, *16*).\n\n
132:6	idm73561					 These verses form a recollection of David’s moving the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem (*2 Sam 6:1-15*) and of the Lord’s oath to David (*2 Sam 7:4-16*).\n\n
132:6	idm73569					 **Ephrathah** is Bethlehem (*Gen 35:19*; *48:7*). • **Jaar** is the singular form of the plural “Jearim.” The Ark was at Kiriath-jearim for twenty years in Samuel’s time (*1 Sam 7:1-2*).\n\n
132:8	idm73580					 These verses are a quotation from Solomon’s prayer at the dedication of the Temple (*2 Chr 6:41-42*).\n\n
132:9	idm73587					 The **priests** were to exhibit righteousness in their lives (*132:16*; *Mal 2:6*).\n\n
132:11	idm73596					 The Lord** swore an oath to David** (*2 Sam 7:4-16*): God’s **promise** is unconditional, but the covenant is not (**If . . . then**). Those who break God’s covenant can expect the discipline of God’s judgment (see *Ps 89:30-37*).\n\n
132:13	idm73608					 The psalmist recounts the selection of Jerusalem and of the priests.\n\n
132:17	idm73614					 **anointed one:** The ruler God chose and established (see *Pss 1–8*) would never cease to provide **light for** the Lord’s **people.** This light would burn continually (see *1 Kgs 11:36*; *2 Kgs 8:19*; cp. *John 8:12*; *Rev 21:23-24*).\n\n
132:18	idm73628					 The adversaries will be humiliated, in contrast to the **glorious king** (*132:9*, *16*).\n\n
133:1	idm73637					 In this wisdom psalm (see *Ps 1*), peaceful and harmonious relationships manifest the presence of God.\n\n
133:1	idm73644					 The psalmist tells of the joy of consecrated relationships.\n\n
133:1	idm73650					 **Brothers** are related by blood, by profession, or by commitment.\n\n
133:2	idm73657					 The **anointing oil** was the oil used to ordain and consecrate Aaron for service in his office (see *Exod 29:7*). • **head . . . beard . . . border of his robe:** The oil consecrated Aaron completely.\n\n
133:3	idm73666					 The **dew** represents the richness of divine blessings; in Jerusalem, it comes from moist winds from the Mediterranean Sea. **Mount Hermon***,* which is capped with snow, is a place of abundant moisture. • A **blessing** is God’s life-giving power, a guarantee of his provision and protection (*5:12*; *41:2*), secured by his presence (*21:6*; *67:1*). Even the other nations will ultimately be blessed (*Pss 67*; *72:17*). Zion is the focal point of God’s blessing (*134:3*; *147:13*). • God gives **life everlasting** to human beings.\n\n
134:1	idm73685					 In the last of the pilgrims’ songs (*Pss 120–134*), the travelers call the Temple workers to praise the Lord. In return, they will receive a much-anticipated blessing.\n\n
134:1	idm73692					 Those **who serve at night** were the priests and Levites (see also *135:2*).\n\n
135:1	idm73700					 God, the Creator and the Lord of history, “made heaven and earth” (*134:3*). He deserves praise because, unlike idols, he redeems his people.\n\n
135:4	idm73707					 The synonyms **Jacob** and **Israel** include all twelve tribes. The Lord cherishes his chosen people. They are his **treasure** out of all the kingdoms of the world (*Exod 19:5-6*).\n\n
135:5	idm73717					 The Lord is superior to any real or imagined supernatural being (see *95:3-5*; *115:4-8*).\n\n
135:6	idm73725					 God is sovereign over the whole created order—he **does whatever pleases him** him. • The phrase **heaven and earth** refers to all of creation.\n\n
135:7	idm73733					 The psalmist tells of God’s sovereignty over the weather (*Pss 29*; *77:17-18*; *78:26*; *104:4*; *147:8-9*; *148:5-6*).\n\n
135:8	idm73745					 The Lord was sovereign over the Exodus and the conquest of the Promised Land.\n\n
135:8	idm73751					 In the tenth and culminating plague against Egypt, God **destroyed the firstborn** of each family. • The **miraculous signs and wonders** are the ten plagues (see *Exod 7–11*; *Deut 4:34*; *Neh 9:10*).\n\n
135:13	idm73762					 The Lord’s name and character stand in contrast to idols.\n\n
135:15	idm73768					 This entire section is repeated in *115:4-11*.\n\n
135:15	idm73775					 Idols corrupt the thinking because they are **merely things** made by humans; they cannot **speak, see, hear,** or **breathe** (*Isa 41:22-24*; *44:9*, *18*; *Rom 1:21-23*).\n\n
135:19	idm73788					 The groups named here comprised the covenant community (see *115:9-11*).\n\n
136:1	idm73795					 This is the last of the Great Hallel psalms (*Pss 120–136*). It distinctively repeats the refrain **His faithful love endures forever** in every verse. The hymn is framed by a call to praise (*136:1-3*, *26*). It proclaims the Lord as the Creator of all and the Redeemer of Israel, both in the distant (*136:10-22*) and in the recent past (*136:23-24*).\n\n
136:1	idm73807					 The psalmist invites the community to praise the Lord, who is good and full of love, the true Lord of humanity. Verse 1 alludes to the poetic expression in *2 Chr 5:13*.\n\n
136:10	idm73814					 The psalmist recounts the early history of Israel’s redemption.\n\n
136:23	idm73820					 The psalmist relates the recent history of Israel’s redemption, although the circumstances are not specified.\n\n
136:25	idm73826					 The Lord provides for all of his creatures.\n\n
136:26	idm73832					 The phrase **God of heaven** is an exilic and postexilic designation for the Lord; it is found in Ezra (*Ezra 1:2*; *5:11*, *12*; *6:9*, *10*; *7:12*; etc.), Nehemiah (*Neh 1:5*; *2:4*, *20*; etc.), and Daniel (*Dan 2:18*, *19*, *37*, *44*).\n\n
137:1	idm73852					 In response to the pain of exile (*137:1-4*), the psalmist resolves to remember Jerusalem even though the memories cause him pain (*137:4-6*). He also writes an astounding imprecation, or prayer for vengeance (*137:7-9*).\n\n
137:2	idm73861					 Because the music of Jerusalem was tied to the joys of life in the Promised Land, the Exile removed any occasion for singing joyous songs. The Babylonians wanted the Judeans to sing and dance for them, but the exiles’ grief made doing so either distasteful or impossible. The songs celebrating the Lord speak of his power and goodness, but his people were filled with doubts and questions. They hung their harps in trees, perhaps signifying the death of their joy under God’s curse (*Deut 21:23*).\n\n
137:5	idm73868					 The psalmist pledges his loyalty to **Jerusalem***,* the city at the center of God’s reign and the location of fellowship with him.\n\n
137:7	idm73876					 The poet witnessed the betrayal of God’s people from Judah by **the Edomites***,* so he curses Edom. The long rivalry between Edom and Judah came to a head during Judah’s last days, when the Edomites handed the Judeans over to the Babylonians (*Obad 1:10-11*) and rejoiced in Jerusalem’s fall. • This prayer for vengeance is shocking.\n\n
138:1	idm73885					 In this final collection of psalms of David, praise and wisdom psalms (*Pss 138–139*, *145*) form a frame around five poems of lament (*Pss 140–144*).\n\n
138:1	idm73894					 In this wisdom psalm, the Lord is presented as the God of gods. He rescued his people and has a perfect plan for them as individuals. The nations will join Israel in glorifying God.\n\n
138:1	idm73900					 The Lord receives praise before the gods of the nations.\n\n
138:4	idm73906					 As the Lord’s **glory** fills the earth, the world’s population must willingly submit to him. **Every king** (cp. *Ps 2*) will join the community of praise as they hear **the** Lord**’s ways** of truth and love.\n\n
138:6	idm73918					 The exalted God takes care of the humble (*138:6*), especially his servant the psalmist (*138:7-8*).\n\n
138:6	idm73926					 God’s holiness and excellence are **great***,* beyond the scope of humanity (see *99:2*; *113:4*; *Isa 6:1*; *57:15*).\n\n
138:8	idm73938					 The psalmist expresses confidence in the Lord’s **plans***,* which are perfect, and prays for God’s continued involvement. The psalmist sees himself as part of God’s plans (see *9:10*; *139:14*).\n\n
139:1	idm73948					 In this wisdom psalm, the psalmist opens every aspect of his being, character, behavior, and speech to God’s examination. As hard as life is, he wants to ensure his own growth in wisdom so that he does not come under God’s judgment of the wicked (*141:5*; *142:3*; *143:8*, *10*; *144:3-4*). Further, the poet recognizes that he cannot escape from the Lord. His sense of stress disappears when he considers the Lord’s loving care for him, even before birth (*139:13-18*). He then invites the Lord to continue examining him as he walks in the path of wisdom (*139:23-24*).\n\n
139:1	idm73961					 The Lord knows the psalmist well; God has examined him thoroughly, in an inescapable examination that is painful at times (*Job 7:17-19*).\n\n
139:2	idm73968					 The phrase **sit down or stand up** refers to daily activities (cp. *Deut 6:6-9*).\n\n
139:3	idm73976					 The Lord’s omniscience and omnipotence provide comfort to the godly, but they imprison the hearts of the wicked (*2:3*).\n\n
139:6	idm73983					 The Lord’s **wonderful** understanding lies beyond the psalmist’s ability to comprehend (see *Judg 13:18*).\n\n
139:7	idm73991					 The psalmist expresses his awe at the Lord’s omnipresence.\n\n
139:8	idm73997					 **down to the grave:** God has total access to his entire creation—even the most hard-to-reach places.\n\n
139:9	idm74004					 **ride the wings of the morning:** This poetic expression describes traveling eastward, as far as the sunrise, if that were possible. • **the farthest oceans:** This expression takes the traveler in the opposite direction, far to the west.\n\n
139:13	idm74012					 The **delicate, inner parts** of the **body** include a person’s very being. • Even when hidden in his **mother’s womb***,* the psalmist was guided by the Lord.\n\n
139:17	idm74022					 **How precious are your thoughts about me:** God’s investigation reveals loving care. Fellowship with the Lord provides riches beyond description.\n\n
139:19	idm74029					 The psalmist’s sense of awe leads him to consider the wicked and to reflect on himself. The Lord, as the examiner of all people, judges the wicked for their destructive acts and speech; thus, the psalmist prays that he will not be among them.\n\n
139:21	idm74035					 **I hate:** Rejection of evil is a mark of wisdom (see *1:1*; *5:4-6*).\n\n
139:23	idm74044					 The psalmist’s prayer against the wicked leads him also to reflect on himself; he does not presume that he is righteous. This prayer has been repeated by believers over the centuries.\n\n
139:24	idm74050					 The **path** of wisdom leads to **everlasting life** (see *1:6*; *Prov 4:18*; *6:23*).\n\n
140:1	idm74061					 In this individual lament, the psalmist artistically sketches God’s enemies with all their evil intents. He prays for the Lord’s protection and rescue with confidence in God’s strength and justice. He foresees the evil as being judged by fire (*140:9-11*) and himself as being vindicated and dwelling in the Lord’s presence (*140:13*).\n\n
140:1	idm74069					 The psalmist prays for the Lord to rescue him from wicked people.\n\n
140:3	idm74075					 **sting like a snake . . . a viper:** These creatures depict the wicked as very corrupt people (see *Prov 23:32*; *Isa 14:29*; *Rom 3:13*).\n\n
140:4	idm74085					 The psalmist asks for divine protection (see *Ps 121*), praying that the Lord will keep him safe from the many schemes of the wicked.\n\n
140:7	idm74092					 The expression **Sovereign** Lord comes from combining the name *Yahweh* with the title *Adonai* (Master). See also *68:20*; *69:6*; *71:16*; *73:28*; *109:21*; *141:8*.\n\n
140:9	idm74108					 The psalmist prays for God’s judgment on the wicked.\n\n
140:10	idm74114					 The psalmist wants **fire** to descend on his enemies, and he wants them thrown into **pits** so they can never attack again. The language foreshadows the New Testament teaching on hell (*Matt 5:22*, *29-30*; *10:28*; *18:9*; *Mark 9:43-47*; *Luke 12:5*; *Jas 3:6*; *2 Pet 2:4*).\n\n
141:1	idm74130					 The psalmist prays for rescue and wisdom, and he envisions the end of evil. The principle of retribution (*141:10*) unifies the psalm.\n\n
141:1	idm74137					 The psalmist prays urgently for rescue. He does not have at hand either **incense** or an **evening offering** (*Exod 29:38-39*), but his prayers and devotion are the reality that those elements represent (cp. *Isa 1:13*; *Rev 5:8*). • **Upraised hands** are a posture of prayer (*Pss 28:2*; *88:9*; *143:6*; *Exod 9:29*; *1 Tim 2:8*).\n\n
141:3	idm74154					 Wisdom sometimes requires protection from oneself. One could say or think things that lead to the evil path (*Prov 13:3*; *21:23*). • Wisdom opens itself to correction from **godly** people (see *Prov 3:11*; *9:8*; *15:31*; *19:25*).\n\n
142:1	idm74167					 The psalmist faces severe persecution, so he cries to the Lord, and the Lord will rescue him.\n\n
142:1	idm74173					 **regarding his experience in the cave:** Cp. *Ps 57:title*.\n\n
142:1	idm74182					 Though **overwhelmed** by his persecutors (*142:6*), the psalmist looks to the Lord for wisdom.\n\n
142:3	idm74190					 The psalmist reaches a point of despair (see *77:3*), and the Lord cares for him in his distress. The psalmist commits himself to the Lord’s wisdom (see *Ps 139*) but laments his entrapment by the wicked (*5:9-10*; *140:5*; *141:9*; *142:3*).\n\n
142:5	idm74202					 Though he is alone, the psalmist’s trust remains in the Lord, who is his **life** (see *9:9*; *16:5*; *27:13*).\n\n
142:6	idm74212					 Though overwhelmed by loneliness and trouble, the psalmist focuses on the Lord’s goodness and protection. He knows that the Lord alone is his Redeemer, so he offers his praise.\n\n
142:7	idm74218					 His experience of confinement and duress is like being in **prison** (see *107:10*).\n\n
143:1	idm74226					 In this lament, the psalmist feels overwhelmed by constant harassment from his foes, so he turns to the Lord’s love, righteousness, and faithfulness. He remembers God’s acts in the past and yearns for the renewal of the Lord’s love. He opens himself to God’s wisdom because he knows that instruction will lead to life.\n\n
143:1	idm74232					 The psalmist prays for God’s love and mercy.\n\n
143:2	idm74238					 All people are guilty before God (*Rom 3:20-24*).\n\n
143:3	idm74245					 **I am losing all hope:** The psalmist confesses his desperation as his life slips away under oppressive and ruthless foes.\n\n
143:5	idm74252					 Remembering God’s acts from the past reassures the psalmist of God’s faithfulness (*42:4*; *63:6*; *77:3*, *6*; *119:55*).\n\n
143:6	idm74263					 The psalmist’s **thirst** is a deep longing for God’s redemption (see *42:1-2*).\n\n
143:7	idm74271					 The psalmist petitions the Lord for a renewal of his love.\n\n
143:7	idm74277					 The psalmist experiences **depression**. He feels that he is dying from anguish (*31:10*; *119:87*), exhausted (*39:10*; *71:9*; *119:81*), fainting with longing (*84:2*), and overwhelmed by the weariness of life (*90:7*, *9*).\n\n
143:8	idm74292					 The psalmist prays for wisdom (see *5:8*; *25:4-6*; *138*; *143:10*). • **your gracious Spirit:** The Spirit brings God’s goodness (see *23:6*).\n\n
143:11	idm74304					 To **preserve** means in this case to restore from despair (*80:19*; *85:6*; *138:7*).\n\n
143:12	idm74314					 A prayer for vindication and renewal of life concludes the psalm.\n\n
144:1	idm74320					 This lament begins with an exclamation of love for the Lord. The community then reflects on the transitory nature of life (*144:3-4*). The psalmist prays for divine intervention and anticipates victory (*144:5-11*). A new song (*144:9-10*) and a prayer for rescue (*144:11*) open up the theme of the Lord’s blessing through his provisions and protection (*144:12-15*).\n\n
144:1	idm74331					 The psalmist’s descriptive names for the Lord reveal his deep love for him.\n\n
144:3	idm74337					 **what are human beings?** The same question in *8:4-6* elicits the answer that humans are mere mortals but are also glorious rulers. The psalmist depicts humans as having a transitory, empty existence (see *90:3*, *7-10*; *102:11*; *109:23*; *146:4*).\n\n
144:5	idm74350					 The psalmist prays for God’s intervention against his **enemies** (cp. *18:7-19*).\n\n
144:12	idm74358					 This prayer for the Lord’s blessing brings the laments of *Pss 140–144* to a close. It offers a vision of God’s provision and protection (see *Ps 127*), not only for the psalmist, but for his descendants and those of all the godly.\n\n
144:12	idm74366					 The psalmist compares **sons** and **daughters** to plants and pillars, which are images of strength and beauty.\n\n
144:13	idm74374					 **no enemy . . . no cries of alarm:** These images depict peace and security.\n\n
145:1	idm74381					 This hymn of praise is the last in this collection of the psalms of David (*Pss 138–145*). Praise continues in the last five psalms (*Pss 146–150*). This psalm celebrates the Lord as King of all (*145:1-3*, *10-13*). God’s actions reveal his royal qualities (*145:4-7*). He cares for all creatures (*145:14-17*) and for those who fear him (*145:18-20*).\n\n
145:1	idm74394					 The psalmist praises God, the Great King who reigns over all other rulers (see *47:2*).\n\n
145:4	idm74401					 This litany praises God’s character and mighty deeds. **Each generation** will continue to testify to God’s power (*22:30*).\n\n
145:8	idm74409					 God consistently demonstrates his character toward **all his creation** (see *136:25*).\n\n
145:10	idm74417					 These verses form a description of the Lord’s kingdom.\n\n
145:14	idm74423					 The Lord cares for his creatures.\n\n
145:20	idm74429					 The Lord cares for those **who love him** and fear him. God-fearers love the Lord and find refuge in him (*5:11*); they seek him as their only true Savior (*40:16*; *70:4*). They will experience a grand future (*69:36*), as well as God’s peace (*119:165*).\n\n
146:1	idm74441					 The Psalter ends with five hallelujah psalms, so named because each begins and ends with **Praise the** Lord**!** (Hebrew *haleluyah*).\n\n
146:1	idm74451					 The call to praise (*146:1-2*) leads into a warning against folly and false confidence (*146:3-4*). The psalm concludes with a blessing for all who place their hope in the Lord (*146:5-7*).\n\n
146:1	idm74460					 This verse is reminiscent of *103:1*, *2*, *22*; *104:1*, *35*.\n\n
146:8	idm74471					 The fourfold repetition of the name of **the** Lord emphasizes that only he heals, unburdens, loves, and protects.\n\n
147:1	idm74479					 The psalmist calls for the Lord to be praised for restoring and blessing Zion, caring for the poor, displaying his power over nature, and revealing himself to his people.\n\n
147:1	idm74485					 This verse is a call to worship.\n\n
147:2	idm74491					 The psalmist recalls the restoration of Jerusalem and the Lord’s afflicted exiles.\n\n
147:4	idm74497					 The Lord created the heavens. • **He counts the stars:** God’s people can feel secure in knowing that the Lord attends to every detail of his creation; he knows all that belongs to him.\n\n
147:6	idm74504					 God measures out his justice on the poor and on the wicked (*55:22*; *140:12*; *145:14*; *146:7*).\n\n
147:7	idm74514					 Human achievements fail to impress the God who commands nature; rather, he takes pleasure in those who fear him.\n\n
147:8	idm74520					 God holds sovereign power over the weather (*77:17-18*; *78:26*; *104:4*; *148:5-6*).\n\n
147:10	idm74530					 **human might:** Any physical or intellectual achievement is a gift from the Lord, just like the **strength of a horse**. These gifts are a reason to praise the Lord, not to boast (*Jer 9:23-24*).\n\n
147:13	idm74539					 The **bars** of the city **gates** symbolize defenses against enemies. • God **blessed** his people by empowering them with safety, prosperity, peace, and provisions (see *133:3*).\n\n
147:15	idm74549					 Simply by speaking **his command***,* the Lord can change the season from unbearable winter to refreshing spring (see *147:8*; *148:5-6*).\n\n
147:19	idm74559					 **words . . . decrees . . . regulations:** The Lord gave powerful words to Israel so that they might obey him (*105:45*).\n\n
148:1	idm74567					 This psalm calls for the whole created order to praise the Lord because he has honored his faithful people.\n\n
148:1	idm74573					 During Jesus’ triumphant entry into Jerusalem, the crowds called out various blessings, including a phrase taken from this verse (*Matt 21:9*; *Mark 11:10*; *Luke 19:38*).\n\n
148:6	idm74582					 The created order is stable because of the Lord’s word (see *33:9*).\n\n
148:8	idm74589					 In the ancient Near East, people viewed different gods as having control over separate aspects of nature. The Lord, however, reigns sovereign over all natural phenomena; all the parts of creation are his servants, bringing praise to him through their obedience (*77:17-18*; *104:4*; *135:7*; *147:8*, *15-18*; *Num 11:31*).\n\n
148:11	idm74601					 The psalmist calls all humans to offer praise to God, regardless of status, age, or gender.\n\n
148:13	idm74607					 Universal praise of the Lord is fitting because he is glorious, and he has blessed his people (see *147:13*; *Isa 46:13*; *Eph 3:10*). • **His faithful ones** are his trusting and devoted servants (*Ps 86:2*).\n\n
149:1	idm74618					 This hymn of praise celebrates the Lord’s victory. He is the **Maker** of Israel (*149:1-2*) and the victorious **King** who shares his glory with his faithful ones (*149:3-9*).\n\n
149:4	idm74628					 God’s people, whom the world ignores and despises, will be vindicated (*Matt 19:30*). The **humble** will experience **victory** over their oppressors and persecutors (see *Isa 61:3*).\n\n
149:6	idm74638					 Vengeance is the Lord’s business (see *2:3*; *94:1*; *102:20*; *142:7*; *146:7*).\n\n
150:1	idm74649					 Everything that breathes is commanded to **praise** the Lord as he deserves. The whole Psalter describes the greatness of the Lord, so this psalm is a fitting conclusion.\n\n
150:1	idm74656					 The phrase **mighty heaven** alludes to *Gen 1* and to God’s glorious work in filling the emptiness.\n\n
150:3	idm74664					 The psalmist calls all people to praise God with instruments and dancing. **flutes:** These wind instruments are not mentioned as being used in Temple worship. • **clanging cymbals:** Temple musicians clapped two bronze bowls together as percussion instruments.\n\n
150:6	idm74672					 **Praise the** Lord**:** This refrain is a fitting conclusion to the entire book of Psalms.\n\n
