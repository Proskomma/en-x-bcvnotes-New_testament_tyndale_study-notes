1:1	idm43551					 After **Ahab’s death,** the Moabites felt secure enough to declare themselves free of their Israelite overlords (see *3:4-5*). The historical notice anticipates the troubles that Israel would experience after the short-lived reign of Ahaziah (see *1 Kgs 22:51*).\n\n
1:2	idm43560					 An **upper room** or balcony enclosed with **latticework** was common; it allowed for the free flow of air and a degree of privacy, but *latticework* was easily broken. • **Baal-zebub** (*lord of flies*) may be a parody of a Canaanite deity named Baal-zebul (*Baal is prince*). The name of this deity was later used for Satan (see *study note on Matt 10:25*). Ahaziah followed his father Ahab in worshiping Baal.\n\n
1:3	idm43573					 **The angel of the** Lord does not seem to be a christophany in the book of Kings, as in other Old Testament texts (e.g., *Judg 6:11-18*). • **Elijah**, who had previously confronted Ahaziah’s father, Ahab, had a twofold message for the king: a condemnation for failure to acknowledge that Yahweh, not Baal, is God (see *1 Kgs 18:16-18*), and a pronouncement of doom (see *1 Kgs 21:17-24*).\n\n
1:9	idm43585					 The arrogant words of the **army captain** contained a contradiction, which **Elijah** pointed out: If Elijah was a **man of God** (i.e., God’s prophet), then his authority was from God and to ignore him was to invite peril (*Deut 18:15-19*). • **Fire** often symbolizes the presence of God in the Scriptures (see *Exod 3:1-6*; *19:18*; cp. *1 Kgs 18:38*). • **Fifty soldiers** was a common grouping (*1 Kgs 18:4*); here it indicates a division within Israel’s military organization.\n\n
1:11	idm43601					 Report of what happened to the previous contingent had apparently reached the king.\n\n
1:13	idm43607					 In contrast to the first two officers, the third commander **pleaded** for mercy before Elijah and God.\n\n
1:15	idm43614					 When **the angel of the** Lord (*1:3*) instructed **Elijah**, he responded in faithful obedience.\n\n
1:16	idm43624					 **Is there no God in Israel?** God’s message to Ahaziah remained unchanged (cp. *1:3-4*).\n\n
1:17	idm43632					 **The second year of the reign of Jehoram** was 852 BC, during Jehoram’s co-regency with his father, **Jehoshaphat** (853–848 BC).\n\n
2:1	idm43642					 Elijah’s translation into heaven transferred the prophetic mantle to Elisha.\n\n
2:2	idm43648					 **Stay here:** Three times, Elijah urged Elisha to remain behind while he traveled on. Each time, Elisha refused with a solemn vow, determined to be with his master to the end.\n\n
2:8	idm43655					 **Elijah folded his cloak together and struck the water with it:** Such symbolic actions visually represented God’s power (see *Exod 14:16*, *21*, *26-27*; *17:8-13*; *1 Kgs 11:30-31*; *Ezek 4*; *5:1-4*).\n\n
2:9	idm43669					 A firstborn son, as the primary heir, inherited **a double share** of his father’s estate (*Deut 21:17*); Elisha asked that Elijah’s God-given spiritual abilities and privileges might continue to live through him.\n\n
2:11	idm43677					 **Chariot of fire . . . horses of fire . . . whirlwind:** These things represent God’s appearance in mighty power (cp. *Isa 66:15*). • **Elijah was carried . . . into heaven**, like Enoch (*Gen 5:24*), without dying. Some believe that Enoch and Elijah will reappear at the time of the end (see *study note on Rev 11:1-13*).\n\n
2:12	idm43688					 Elijah was Elisha’s spiritual **father** and personal mentor. Cp. the tribute given him at his death, *13:14*.\n\n
2:13	idm43696					 **Elisha picked up Elijah’s cloak** and successfully parted **the Jordan River**. Elisha was indeed Elijah’s successor, as the other prophets recognized.\n\n
2:16	idm43704					 The prophets searched the **wilderness,** perhaps to be certain that Elijah had not temporarily disappeared (cp. *1 Kgs 18:12*). Elisha already knew that the search was pointless.\n\n
2:20	idm43712					 **Elisha** used a **new bowl** (*Deut 21:3*) filled with **salt** (*Lev 2:13*; *Ezek 43:24*) to symbolize calling upon God to purify the people and the environment. Elisha made it clear that the Lord, not he or the *salt,* had **purified this water.**\n\n
2:23	idm43726					 The **group of boys** could have been young adults; the Hebrew term has a wide range of meanings, at times being used of a young adult still unskilled in his profession, such as when Solomon petitioned the Lord for wisdom because he was young and inexperienced (*1 Kgs 3:7*). Joshua’s spies at Jericho were designated by the same term (*Josh 6:22-23*). • To call someone **baldy** was disrespectful. The young men told Elisha to **go away** (literally *go up*), mocking Elisha’s God-given position as successor to Elijah.\n\n
3:2	idm43738					 Ahab apparently erected **the sacred pillar** (or *stela*) **of Baal** when instituting Baal worship (see *1 Kgs 16:32-33*). Similar stones were also erected to pagan deities in Judah (*1 Kgs 14:23*); such pillars were later purged by Jehu (*2 Kgs 10:26-27*) and Josiah (*23:13-15*).\n\n
3:4	idm43751					 The joint war of Israel and Judah against Moab was the setting for one of Elisha’s miracles.\n\n
3:4	idm43757					 The Moabite rebellion (see *1:1*) began with the withholding of the **annual tribute.** The Moabite Stone (Mesha Stela) records details of Israel’s domination of northern Moab in the days of Omri and Ahab, a subservience that continued into the reigns of Ahaziah and Joram.\n\n
3:6	idm43765					 **Jehoshaphat***’*s ready compliance with **Joram***’*s appeal was typical of his participation in the undertakings of the northern kings (*1 Kgs 22:4*; *2 Chr 20:35-37*). The marriage of Jehoshaphat’s son Jehoram to Ahab’s daughter Athaliah (*2 Chr 18:1*; *21:6*) heightened Jehoshaphat’s entanglement with Israel.\n\n
3:8	idm43779					 **The king of Edom . . . joined them:** Edom was apparently a vassal kingdom to Judah at this time. Later, in the days of Jehoshaphat’s son Jehoram, Edom successfully rebelled against Judah (*8:20-22*). The southern route through Edom avoided strong Moabite fortifications, but it was dangerous because **water** was scarce.\n\n
3:11	idm43788					 **Is there no prophet of the** Lord** with us?** Diviners or prophets often traveled with armies to perceive the divine will. **Jehoshaphat** again desired an oracle from a true prophet to learn the Lord’s intentions for the battle (cp. *1 Kgs 22:7*). However, this time he waited until the campaign had begun before inquiring of the Lord.\n\n
3:13	idm43799					 Elisha participated because of Jehoshaphat’s presence, despite his entanglement with the **pagan** Joram.\n\n
3:15	idm43806					 **bring me someone who can play the harp:** Music stimulated the prophetic spirit (cp. *Ps 49:4*).\n\n
3:18	idm43814					 The supply of **water**—**a simple thing for the** Lord—was a harbinger of God’s enabling the allies to defeat the **army of Moab.**\n\n
3:24	idm43824					 **The army of Israel . . . destroyed the towns.** Elisha’s prophecy was fulfilled, although **Kir-hareseth** escaped total destruction.\n\n
3:26	idm43832					 The reason for the Moabite king’s **attempt to break through the enemy lines** might have been to avenge himself against the Edomite king or to escape through a perceived weakness in the allied lines.\n\n
3:27	idm43839					 **So there was great anger against Israel:** The Hebrew phrase translated *great anger* occurs elsewhere to describe the Lord’s fury against Israel for covenant violations (*Jer 21:5*; *32:37*; *Zech 7:12*).\n\n
4:1	idm43850					 The widow’s **husband** had been **a member of the group of prophets . . . who served** Elisha (*2:3-18*). • **take my two sons as slaves:** The law of Moses allowed a creditor to place a debtor and his children into slavery to work off a debt (*Exod 21:2-4*; *Lev 25:10*).\n\n
4:4	idm43862					 **shut the door:** Elisha was meeting a private need; the miracle was not for public show. • **Olive oil**, an important staple, had commercial value (see *1 Kgs 5:11*; *2 Chr 11:11*; *Hos 12:1*).\n\n
4:5	idm43873					 Elisha was absent during the miracle so the woman and her son would recognize that the provision was by the Lord’s power.\n\n
4:8	idm43879					 Elisha’s dealings with the **woman** from **Shunem** are presented in two parallel sections (*4:8-20*, *21-37*). **Shunem** was a border town in the tribal allotment to Issachar (*Josh 19:18*).\n\n
4:9	idm43891					 Because the Shunemite woman recognized that Elisha was a true prophet—**a holy man of God**—she wished to provide hospitality for him during his frequent travels (see *Isa 58:7*; *Heb 13:2*; *3 Jn 1:5*). • **A small room . . . on the roof**, reached by an outside stairway, assured privacy for both Elisha and his hosts.\n\n
4:11	idm43902					 **Elisha** wanted to return some favor to his host. • **his servant Gehazi:** Gehazi served as an apprentice, as Elisha had served with Elijah (*1 Kgs 19:21*). It would not be unusual for a prophet to consult with his attendant.\n\n
4:15	idm43911					 Cp. similar promises and responses at *Gen 18:9-15*; *Luke 1:6-20*.\n\n
4:18	idm43919					 **“My head hurts!”** The boy probably suffered a brain aneurysm. The woman’s faith and character were put to the test with the sudden death of her son **on her lap.**\n\n
4:21	idm43927					 **laid him on the bed of the man of God:** The woman’s action kept her son’s death a secret from others and demonstrated her confidence in Elisha’s ability to do a miracle.\n\n
4:24	idm43934					 **Mount Carmel** lay about twenty miles northwest of Shunem. The length of the trip and the woman’s obvious haste aroused Elisha’s suspicion that some tragedy concerning the **child** had occurred. • **“everything is fine”:** The woman brushed off Gehazi’s inquiries; she was resolved to deal with no one but Elisha.\n\n
4:27	idm43943					 **caught hold of his feet:** With this sign of deep respect and supplication, the woman poured out her heart to Elisha (see *Matt 28:9*; *Luke 8:41*, *47*; *17:16*; *Rev 1:17*).\n\n
4:28	idm43955					 The loss of her son undid all the joy she felt at his promised birth and seemed to make that birth a cruel deception.\n\n
4:29	idm43961					 Elisha instructed Gehazi not to **talk to anyone along the way**, indicating the seriousness and urgency of the mission. Jesus gave similar instructions when he sent out the seventy-two disciples (*Luke 10:4*). • Laying Elisha’s **staff on the child’s face** signified the prophet’s intention to identify with the boy and claim God’s power.\n\n
4:31	idm43970					 **no sign of life:** Elisha’s staff held no magical power; only God is the author of life (*Acts 17:25-28*).\n\n
4:33	idm43978					 **shut the door:** Elisha followed the same procedure he had advised the widow to take earlier (*4:4*). If God were to perform the miracle, it would not be for public display. Only the mother knew of the boy’s death and only she needed to know of Elisha’s efforts to petition God for the boy’s life.\n\n
4:34	idm43986					 **lay down on the child’s body:** Elisha’s actions and faith in the Lord were similar to Elijah’s (*1 Kgs 17:17-24*).\n\n
4:36	idm43994					 Again, **Gehazi** summoned the woman (*4:12*, *15*), and again, she **fell at** Elisha’s **feet** (*4:27*), this time **overwhelmed with gratitude** rather than anguish.\n\n
4:38	idm44007					 Like Bethel (*2:3*) and Jericho (*2:5*, *15*), **Gilgal** was the center for a **group of prophets** (*2:1*). Elisha was the leader of these groups, and thus sat at the head of the table for meals.\n\n
4:39	idm44019					 The men immediately recognized that the young man’s **wild gourds** were **poisonous**; they did not want to be poisoned or to waste the stew during a famine, so they turned to Elisha for help. The **flour** was a tangible symbol of God’s miraculous provision of food.\n\n
4:42	idm44028					 **grain . . . loaves of barley . . . first grain:** This offering was similar to the first of the crops that were normally presented to God (*Lev 23:20*) and to the priests (*Deut 18:4-5*) as their portion. Because of the famine, Elisha shared the offering with all the **people**. • Elisha’s feeding **a hundred people** with **a sack of fresh grain and twenty loaves of barley bread** anticipated the miraculous ministry of Jesus (*Matt 14:15-21*; *15:32-38*). Nothing is impossible for God (*Matt 19:26*; *Luke 1:37*; *18:27*).\n\n
5:1	idm44045					 **The king of Aram** was probably Ben-hadad II (860–843 BC). • **the** Lord** had given Aram great victories:** The Lord is sovereign over all nations (*Pss 47:8*; *99:1-2*; *Rom 13:1*). • **from leprosy:** Naaman’s access to society and Gehazi’s later social freedom (*2 Kgs 8:4-5*) suggest that the problem was not Hansen’s disease but another incurable skin disease (see *Lev 13:10-11*, *45-46*).\n\n
5:2	idm44063					 During Joram’s reign, strained relations between Israel and the Arameans led to incursions by **Aramean raiders** into the northern kingdom (see *6:8*, *24*).\n\n
5:5	idm44072					 The lavish **gifts** and the royal **letter of introduction**, common practices in the ancient Near East, underscored Naaman’s wealth, his value to the Aramean king, and Elisha’s reputation. Unlike Ahaziah, who sent his messengers directly to the temple of Baal-zebub in Philistia (*1:2*), the Aramean king followed diplomatic protocol by sending Naaman first to King Joram.\n\n
5:7	idm44081					 **tore his clothes:** This action was often a sign of intense agitation (*11:4*), grief (*Gen 37:34*; *2 Sam 13:31*), or sorrow (*2 Kgs 6:30*; *Job 1:20*; *2:12*). Due to the perennial distrust and hostilities between the Arameans and the Israelites, Joram assumed that the Aramean king was **trying to pick a fight,** as had occurred in the days of his father Ahab (*1 Kgs 20:1-12*).\n\n
5:8	idm44096					 Elisha had no respect for King Joram (*3:14*), but he sent the message because of the opportunity for a testimony to the Lord’s power.\n\n
5:9	idm44103					 Rather than receiving Naaman, who came to buy his healing, Elisha left him standing **at the door** and communicated with him by **messenger**. Naaman expected special treatment befitting his station and was disappointed both in Elisha’s failure to receive him and at his instructions to **wash . . . seven times in the Jordan River***,* which he considered inferior to the rivers of Aram. Washing in the Jordan would be a visible reminder that only Yahweh, the God of Israel, could heal Naaman.\n\n
5:13	idm44113					 **Naaman** swallowed his pride. He did **as the man of God had instructed him** and experienced God’s healing power. Obedience to God brings God’s blessings and purity (*Ps 119:9-11*).\n\n
5:15	idm44122					 **No God . . . except in Israel:** Naaman’s physical healing led to spiritual conversion. Like the Samaritan leper healed by Jesus, Naaman returned to give thanks to his benefactor (*Luke 17:15-16*). • Naaman offered a gift out of gratitude, but **Elisha refused**; God’s grace and blessings were not to be obtained through money,** gifts**, or favors (*Isa 55:1-5*; *Rom 2:4*; *1 Cor 2:12*; *Eph 4:8*).\n\n
5:17	idm44136					 **earth from this place:** Ancient Near Eastern custom identified a nation’s god with the soil of the country where he was worshiped; Naaman apparently believed he needed Israelite soil in order to build an altar to properly worship Israel’s God.\n\n
5:18	idm44143					 The name **Rimmon** appears in the name Tabrimmon (*1 Kgs 15:18*), the father of Ben-hadad I. In Aramean, the god’s name is properly Ramman (*the thunderer*), a storm-god noted in Assyrian inscriptions. The spelling *Rimmon* (which means *pomegranate*) may reflect a deliberate pun belittling the deity.\n\n
5:22	idm44154					 Naaman believed Gehazi’s fabricated story to be genuine and was happy to repay Elisha.\n\n
5:24	idm44160					 **the citadel:** The Hebrew word means *hill* or *high point in a city.* Citadels were often erected in such places (*2 Chr 27:3*).\n\n
5:25	idm44170					 Gehazi could not conceal his deed from Elisha. Gehazi’s deception and misuse of his privileged position earned his master’s disapproval and the loss of his status as Elisha’s servant. But it also brought on him the penalty of **Naaman’s leprosy***,* a sign that Gehazi had traded places with Naaman spiritually as well.\n\n
6:1	idm44178					 **logs . . . new place for us to meet:** The forest areas of the Jordan Valley near Jericho and Gilgal (see *2:1*, *4*) provided several types of wood for building.\n\n
6:5	idm44187					 The Hebrew text indicates that the **ax head** was made of iron, quite valuable in a time when few iron tools were available. Because **it was . . . borrowed***,* the loss was even more acute.\n\n
6:8	idm44196					 Elisha’s ability to know the Aramean king’s raiding strategies allowed him to warn Joram of danger. Apparently, the healing of Naaman (*5:1-19*) had improved relations between Elisha and Joram (see *3:13-14*).\n\n
6:11	idm44204					 When the **king of Aram** learned that **Elisha** had the ability to give advance warning to the **king of Israel**, he commanded his men to capture the prophet. • **Dothan** was situated about ten miles north of Samaria. Archaeological excavations have confirmed the city’s existence in this period.\n\n
6:15	idm44214					 The identity of Elisha’s alarmed **servant** is unknown. He was evidently the replacement of Gehazi (*5:27*).\n\n
6:16	idm44222					 Elisha asked the Lord to open **the young man’s eyes**, revealing an angelic force protecting the city. Angels are active in the affairs of the world (*Ps 34:7*; *Dan 10:20–11:1*; *Heb 1:7*).\n\n
6:21	idm44232					 **My father:** Elisha had used this term of respect when addressing Elijah (*2:12*), as had Naaman’s servant when speaking to his master (*5:13*).\n\n
6:23	idm44241					 **great feast:** The Israelites’ kind treatment had the result that the Arameans no longer raided Israel. However, it only provided a temporary suspension of hostilities.\n\n
6:24	idm44248					 So severe was this **famine** that normally unclean things were not only eaten but sold for an exorbitant price. Donkey meat, for example, was forbidden by the laws regarding unclean foods (*Lev 11:1-7*). **Dove’s dung** may be a variety of wild vegetable, but the consumption of dung is known from other sources describing siege conditions (*Isa 36:12*). The *dove’s dung* might also have been used for fuel.\n\n
6:26	idm44259					 Cannibalism under severe conditions was part of God’s curse for unfaithfulness and disobedience (*Deut 28:53*, *57*). It also occurred during the siege that brought about the fall of Jerusalem (*Lam 4:9-10*).\n\n
6:30	idm44268					 When Joram learned of cannibalism in the city, **he tore his clothes in despair**. • **wearing burlap under his robe next to his skin:** Doing this was an outward sign of mourning.\n\n
6:31	idm44276					 **separate Elisha’s head from his shoulders:** Decapitation of one’s enemy was frequent (*10:6-8*; *1 Sam 17:51*; *31:9*; *2 Sam 4:7-8*, *12*; *20:22*; *Matt 14:11*) in the ancient Near East. Joram reasoned that the situation stemmed from Elisha’s earlier sparing of Ben-hadad’s troops (*2 Kgs 6:22-23*). Moreover, Ben-hadad had been after Elisha (*6:13*), so the prophet’s presence had endangered the whole city.\n\n
6:32	idm44292					 **Elisha** was aware that Joram was sending a **messenger** to assassinate him and that the king was not far behind.\n\n
6:33	idm44300					 **And the king said:** Literally *And he said. ***The messenger** might have been delivering the king’s words verbatim. • Because the **misery** of the siege appeared to be **from the** Lord*,* Joram felt that further prayer for rescue was useless.\n\n
7:1	idm44313					 **This is what the** Lord** says:** Despite Joram’s pessimism and hostility, Elisha brought a message of hope. **Tomorrow** would bring a complete change in conditions, with good products again available. • **twelve quarts . . . only one piece of silver:** Cp. with the prices in *6:25*.\n\n
7:2	idm44325					 The disbelief of Joram’s **officer** would cause him to miss God’s blessings.\n\n
7:3	idm44332					 These **four men** were outcasts because of their condition and remained outside **the city gates** (*Lev 13:45-46*; see *Luke 17:11-13*).\n\n
7:5	idm44342					 **The Hittites** had settled in the areas just north of Aram and were often in conflict with the Arameans.\n\n
7:8	idm44349					 The men realized that they needed to share their good fortune with the people in Samaria.\n\n
7:10	idm44355					 Joram suspected that the Arameans had set a trap, perhaps attempting to lure the Israelites into an ambush. Joshua had used a similar battle tactic in taking the city of Ai (*Josh 8:3-23*).\n\n
7:13	idm44362					 The trail of abandoned articles confirmed the Arameans’ **rush to escape**, and the Israelites **plundered the Aramean camp**. True to Elisha’s prophecy, food supplies were now readily available, and Joram’s doubting **officer** was **knocked down and trampled to death**.\n\n
7:18	idm44372					 The repetition of Elisha’s previous conversation with Joram’s **officer** emphasizes the exact fulfillment of the prophecy.\n\n
8:3	idm44379					 **getting back her house and land:** Her property might have been held in trust or confiscated.\n\n
8:4	idm44386					 **Gehazi***,* Elisha’s former **servant***,* had gained sufficient social standing to serve **the king**. Although Joram had often been Elisha’s adversary, he apparently wanted to know more about **the great things** Elisha had done.\n\n
8:6	idm44398					 **everything . . . was restored:** Not only did the woman receive her land but Joram made sure that she received all income due to the selling of **crops that had been harvested during her absence**. Joram, who sometimes displayed less than noble characteristics (*3:13-14*; *6:31-33*), on this occasion showed higher ethical standards than his father Ahab had regarding Naboth’s vineyard (*1 Kgs 21:1-16*).\n\n
8:7	idm44409					 Elisha’s freedom to visit **Damascus** demonstrated the great respect that even Israel’s enemies had for him. The visit fulfilled the commission originally given to Elijah (*1 Kgs 19:15*).\n\n
8:8	idm44417					 **Will I recover?** Cp. *1:2*.\n\n
8:9	idm44425					 **forty camels with the finest products:** Although gifts were not unusual when inquiring of a prophet (see *1 Sam 9:6-8*), Ben-hadad’s gifts were lavish, testifying both to his wealth and to the esteem he had for Elisha.\n\n
8:10	idm44433					 Elisha instructed Hazael to tell the king that he would **surely recover** because his illness was not life-threatening. Yet Elisha knew that Ben-hadad would **surely die**.\n\n
8:11	idm44441					 Elisha **started weeping** because he foresaw the atrocities that Hazael would commit against God’s people when he became king (*8:28*; *9:14-15*; *10:32-33*; *12:17-18*; *13:3*, *22*).\n\n
8:13	idm44454					 **a nobody like me:** Literally *a dog.* As scavengers, dogs were held in low esteem in the ancient Near East. King Shalmaneser III of Assyria observed in his annals, “Hazael, son of a nobody, seized the throne.”\n\n
8:15	idm44462					 **Hazael became the next king of Aram:** Although Hazael obediently delivered Elisha’s answer to Ben-hadad, **the next day** he hastened the fulfillment of Elisha’s prophecy by assassinating the king and taking the throne for himself. Perhaps Hazael falsely reasoned that the prophecy gave him a divine mandate.\n\n
8:16	idm44470					 **Jehoram** was co-regent with his father, **Jehoshaphat**, for five years before becoming king of **Judah** on his own in **the fifth year of the reign of Joram** (848 BC).\n\n
8:17	idm44481					 **Jehoram** reigned from 853 to 841 BC, including a five-year co-regency with his father, Jehoshaphat.\n\n
8:18	idm44489					 **evil in the** Lord**’s sight:** Not only did Jehoram marry Ahab’s daughter Athaliah but he **followed the example of the kings of Israel** in worshiping idols. Some have suggested that *Ps 45* was composed in honor of the marriage between Jehoram and Athaliah, which joined the royal houses of Judah and Israel (see *Ps 45:12*; Athaliah was the daughter of Jezebel, the princess of Tyre). While the marriage created temporary harmony between the kingdoms, it brought disastrous spiritual results. Under Athaliah’s influence, Jehoram instituted various false forms of worship (*2 Chr 21:11*), including worship of Baal (*2 Kgs 11:17-18*).\n\n
8:19	idm44503					 Despite Jehoram’s wickedness, God did not **destroy Judah** but honored his covenant with **David** (*2 Sam 7:11-16*). • The Lord had promised to preserve David’s descendants on the throne of Judah as a **shining . . . lamp** of God’s grace (*1 Kgs 11:36*). God’s promises to David ultimately find fulfillment in Jesus (*Ezek 34:23-31*), the light of the world (*John 4:1-5*).\n\n
8:22	idm44516					 The town of **Libnah** was located in southwestern Judah, not far from the Philistine border. The Philistines and the Arabians also launched an attack against Jerusalem during Jehoram’s reign; all of Jehoram’s sons except Ahaziah were killed (*2 Chr 21:16-17*).\n\n
8:24	idm44524					 **Jehoram died** of a painful disease of the bowels and was excluded from the royal tombs (*2 Chr 21:18-20*).\n\n
8:25	idm44532					 **twelfth year of the reign of Joram:** The year of Ahaziah’s accession to the throne of Judah (841 BC) was pivotal in ancient Near Eastern history. Before the year was out, both Joram and Ahaziah lay dead, Hazael was confirmed as king of Damascus, and Shalmaneser III of Assyria dominated the region.\n\n
8:28	idm44540					 Once again, a king of Judah **joined** an Israelite king in battle against the Arameans at **Ramoth-gilead** (see *1 Kgs 22:1-40*). • **Jezreel** served as a second capital for Israel during Ahab’s reign (*1 Kgs 21:1*); he retreated there after witnessing Elijah’s contest with the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel (*1 Kgs 18:46*).\n\n
9:1	idm44552					 The writer recaps Jehu’s coup that instituted the fourth dynasty in Israel in four phases: (1) Elisha sent a member of the prophetic band to the army camp at Ramoth-gilead to anoint Jehu as the next king of Israel (*9:1-10*); (2) Jehu’s men learned of the prophet’s visit to their commander and proclaimed Jehu as king (*9:11-15*); (3) Both Joram and King Ahaziah of Judah were killed (*9:16-29*); and (4) Jezebel was killed (*9:30-37*).\n\n
9:1	idm44562					 Although Jehu received prophetic endorsement of his kingship, his anointing did not signify approval of all his subsequent actions. It did, however, carry a divine charge to execute the house of Ahab as punishment for his wickedness and idolatry (*9:8-10*).\n\n
9:2	idm44569					 This **Jehoshaphat** is not to be confused with the former king of Judah, who was the son of Asa.\n\n
9:4	idm44576					 As the **young prophet** carried out his commission, he detailed for Jehu the means for carrying out the divine sentence against the **family of Ahab** (see *1 Kgs 21:20-24*).\n\n
9:11	idm44585					 **madman:** God’s faithful servants are often disdained as mad by others (see *Jer 29:26*; *Hos 9:7*).\n\n
9:13	idm44594					 **The bare steps** of the house served as a throne and the soldiers’ **cloaks** as a carpet. Spreading out garments in this fashion was a sign of respect (see *Matt 21:8*).\n\n
9:14	idm44603					 **led a conspiracy:** Because Jezreel, where Joram was recovering from his wounds, lay about forty-five miles away, Jehu’s coup needed to be carried out swiftly and inconspicuously.\n\n
9:16	idm44610					 While Jehu was receiving the homage of his men as their king, Joram and Ahaziah were still at **Jezreel** (*8:28-29*; *9:14-15*).\n\n
9:21	idm44619					 **the plot of land that had belonged to Naboth:** The property Ahab took from Naboth became the location for the demise of Ahab’s line, fulfilling Elijah’s prophecy (*1 Kgs 21:19-24*).\n\n
9:22	idm44627					 The charges against Joram echoed those against his father Ahab and his mother Jezebel (*1 Kgs 16:30-33*; *21:25-26*).\n\n
9:27	idm44635					 **The road to Beth-haggan** led southward along the eastern edge of the Jezreel Valley, past **Ibleam** and on to Samaria. • **Megiddo . . . he died there:** King **Ahaziah** escaped to Samaria, where he was captured and brought to Jehu (*2 Chr 22:8-9*). The accounts in Chronicles and Kings might be combined to show that although Ahaziah was wounded at **Gur**, he managed to go on to *Samaria.* Later, Jehu’s men seized him and brought him to Jehu, where he was put to death. Since the Chronicler associates Ahaziah’s capture with Jehu’s slaying of Ahab’s descendants and some of *Ahaziah’*s relatives (see *2 Kgs 10:1-17*), it appears that Ahaziah avoided his pursuers for a time. The account here is greatly compressed, with the writer recording Ahaziah’s death and burial before relating further events.\n\n
9:30	idm44650					 The narrator returns to events at **Jezreel.** Defiant **Jezebel** prepared for Jehu’s arrival and her impending death by adorning herself, remaining haughty to the end.\n\n
9:31	idm44658					 Jezebel accused Jehu of being another **Zimri,** perhaps to remind him that Zimri’s quest for power was short-lived (*1 Kgs 16:15-19*).\n\n
9:32	idm44666					 Jehu showed his violent nature when he **trampled** Jezebel’s **body under his horses’ hooves.** • While the Hebrew word translated **eunuchs** can refer to emasculated males, it can also refer to high officials.\n\n
9:34	idm44675					 The scene depicting Jezebel’s end brought Elijah’s prophecy against the house of Ahab to final fulfillment (*1 Kgs 21:21-24*; *22:34-38*).\n\n
9:34	idm44683					 **Jehu went into the palace** to dine, a tacit declaration of his assumption of the throne.\n\n
10:1	idm44690					 The writer focuses on two important events of Jehu’s reign: his murder of all who might claim Joram’s throne (*10:1-17*), and his execution of the priests of Baal (*10:18-27*).\n\n
10:1	idm44698					 Ahab’s **sons** (the term can include grandsons) may have been with Joram at Jezreel temporarily while he was recovering from his wounds (*8:29*) but had fled to **Samaria** to escape Jehu’s purge.\n\n
10:2	idm44707					 Jehu’s message pointing out the city’s military capacity to protect the surviving members of Ahab’s dynasty was actually a declaration of war, and the leaders of Samaria understood it as such. Jehu commanded the main armed forces of Israel, and at Jezreel he had already demonstrated his military power and ruthlessness. The leaders were **paralyzed with fear** and agreed to **do anything** Jehu instructed them to do.\n\n
10:6	idm44715					 Decapitation of enemies was a common practice in the ancient Near East (*6:31-32*; *1 Sam 17:46*, *51*; cp. *Matt 14:11*).\n\n
10:9	idm44725					 **But who killed all these?** Jehu claimed that the gruesome deaths were the Lord’s will that had been communicated through Elijah (*1 Kgs 19:16-17*; *21:21-24*).\n\n
10:11	idm44734					 Jehu also killed all of Ahab’s surviving **relatives** and associates **without a single survivor***,* exceeding his divine commission and pursuing a selfish quest for power at any cost. The Lord condemned his excesses through the prophet Hosea (*Hos 1:4*).\n\n
10:12	idm44744					 The precise location of **Beth-eked** is uncertain, but it was in the area of Jenin. • The reply of Ahaziah’s **relatives** to Jehu sealed their fate. Jehu apparently reasoned that their relation to Ahaziah, hence loosely to the house of Ahab through his daughter Athaliah, could give them some claim on the throne of Israel. In this second round of executions, Jehu again exceeded his commission to terminate Ahab’s dynasty.\n\n
10:15	idm44752					 Jeremiah portrays **Jehonadab** as head of a group of desert nomads who spent their lives in protest against the decadent religion of society (*Jer 35*). **Recab** was a Kenite (*1 Chr 2:55*). While the nomadic Kenites were concentrated in southern Judah, some lived in Galilee (*Judg 4:17*; *5:24*). Their opposition to the apostasy of the royal house may have led them to welcome Jehu as a rescuer and reformer.\n\n
10:18	idm44764					 By executing the priests of Baal, Jehu intended to wipe out religious worship associated with the house of Ahab, thereby destroying any sentimental attachment people had with the former dynasty.\n\n
10:18	idm44770					 Jehu deceptively played to the populace, promising to continue and promote the **worship of Baal.**\n\n
10:25	idm44777					 **innermost fortress . . . sacred pillar:** Canaanite temples contained a recessed place in the wall that held an image of a sacred stone. The temple of Baal in Samaria contained a sacred altar to Baal and an Asherah pole that Jehu’s men destroyed. Josiah’s later purge of Baal worship in Judah similarly involved burning and demolishing the Asherah pole in the Temple in Jerusalem (*23:6*).\n\n
10:27	idm44785					 Turning the destroyed **temple of Baal . . . into a public toilet** rendered it unclean, unfit for future religious ceremonies.\n\n
10:28	idm44792					 Despite extinguishing **Baal worship from Israel, Jehu** retained the worship of **gold calves at Bethel and Dan***,* perpetuating the state religion instituted by Jeroboam I (*1 Kgs 12:28-30*). This would one day lead to the fall of the northern kingdom (*2 Kgs 17:21-23*).\n\n
10:30	idm44803					 God fulfilled his promise of a royal line to **the fourth generation**; four generations of Jehu’s descendants reigned as kings of Israel (Jehoahaz, Jehoash, Jeroboam II, and Zechariah).\n\n
10:31	idm44810					 In response to Jehu’s unfaithfulness, **the** Lord** began to cut down the size of Israel’s territory**, one of the curses for spiritual infidelity to the covenant (*Deut 28:25*). • The Aramean king **Hazael** moved southward, conquering areas **east of the Jordan River** north of the border of Moab. The Arameans continued the pressure against Israel throughout the reign of Jehu and into the reign of his son Jehoahaz (*2 Kgs 12:17-18*; *13:3*).\n\n
11:1	idm44824					 **Athaliah, the mother of King Ahaziah of Judah***,* was the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel and the wife of King Jehoram of Judah (*8:18*, *26*). As queen mother, she wielded powerful influence. Unfortunately, it was for evil (*8:18*, *27*; *2 Chr 22:3-4*) and included her plans to **destroy the rest of the royal family** (see *2 Chr 22:10*). The demise of Ahab’s family in Samaria was complete, but Athaliah seized power in Judah in a slaughter that mirrored Jehu’s slaughter of her family in Samaria.\n\n
11:2	idm44839					 **Jehosheba** was probably born to **Jehoram** by a wife other than Athaliah and was therefore Ahaziah’s half-sister (cp. Josephus, *Antiquities* 9.7.1). • The infant **Joash** was born to Zibiah of Beersheba (*2 Chr 24:1*), perhaps a lesser wife of Ahaziah. The baby’s birth might therefore have escaped Athaliah’s notice.\n\n
11:3	idm44850					 Jehosheba’s concealment of Joash for **six years** was punishable by death if discovered. **Athaliah ruled over the land** from 841 to 835 BC.\n\n
11:4	idm44859					 **Jehoiada** knew that what he was doing was treasonous (*11:14*), and he was not sure that he could trust the men he was enlisting as his co-conspirators, so he had them **swear an oath of loyalty** before he revealed to them the existence of the rightful heir to the throne of Judah. These men went out to the towns of Judah and brought the Levites and heads of families to the Temple in Jerusalem, where they made a covenant with Joash (*2 Chr 23:3*). • **The Carite mercenaries***,* from the Aegean, served as bodyguards for the king (*2 Sam 20:23*).\n\n
11:5	idm44872					 **Jehoiada** divided the royal guard into distinctive units: some to guard the young king; others to take up posts at the **palace***,* the **Sur Gate** (or Foundation Gate, *2 Chr 23:5*), and positions **behind the palace guard**; and still others to **stand guard . . . at the** Lord**’s Temple**. All care was taken to secure the king and the site for his anointing.\n\n
11:11	idm44887					 With all the **palace guards** in place and **their weapons ready***, . . .* **Jehoiada brought out Joash** before the populace and crowned him **king**. He also presented him **a copy of God’s laws**. The king was to receive a copy of the law and make a copy for himself and “read it daily as long as he lives” (*Deut 17:18-19*). Jehoiada provides a strong contrast with Athaliah’s pagan reign.\n\n
11:13	idm44900					 The **pillar** may be one of the two pillars that Solomon erected at the **Temple** entrance (*1 Kgs 7:15-22*; *2 Chr 23:13*), or the Hebrew term could mean a raised platform set in place for the occasion so that the new king could be seen by all. • Athaliah’s cry of **treason** is ironic, considering her own treasonous murders to seize the throne (*2 Kgs 11:1*).\n\n
11:16	idm44912					 Athaliah’s death at **the gate where horses enter the palace grounds** is reminiscent of her mother Jezebel’s death under the hooves of Jehu’s horses (*9:33*).\n\n
11:17	idm44920					 The renewal of the **covenant** was especially important after years of pagan rule. *Covenant* faithfulness accompanied by periodic renewal was mandated in the law (*Deut 31:9-13*), and Israel observed it at junctures in its history (see *2 Kgs 23:1-3*; *Josh 24*).\n\n
11:18	idm44931					 The **temple of Baal** may be the temple discovered in Ramat Rahel about three miles south of Jerusalem. As Jehu destroyed Baal worship in the northern kingdom (*10:18-27*) so the people of Judah **tore . . . down** this pagan temple and executed its priest. • **Jehoiada . . . stationed guards at the Temple** as a precaution against further reprisal by those loyal to Athaliah and her false religion.\n\n
11:19	idm44941					 **The city was peaceful**—a mark of the kingdom where God and his law are honored (*Isa 35:10*; *65:18-24*; *Jer 33:6-16*).\n\n
11:21	idm44951					 The reign of Joash is recorded in standard format: accession (*11:21–12:3*), royal activities (*12:4-18*), and closing notice (*12:19-21*). Particular focus is on Joash’s efforts to repair the Temple (*12:4-16*) and his subsequent stripping of the Temple’s treasures in the face of an Aramean invasion (*12:17-18*).\n\n
12:1	idm44962					 **Joash** reigned from 835 to 796 BC.\n\n
12:2	idm44970					 **Joash**’s indebtedness to **Jehoiada***,* the **priest** who **instructed him***,* kept him faithful to the Lord while Jehoiada was alive. However, after Jehoiada’s death, godless leaders influenced Joash to forsake the Lord and follow Canaanite practices (see *2 Chr 24:17-22*). • Joash’s failure to **destroy the pagan shrines** later became a source of spiritual compromise. Royal tolerance of such shrines in Judah had previously provoked God’s anger (*1 Kgs 14:23-26*) and would do so again in Joash’s day (*2 Chr 24:23-24*).\n\n
12:4	idm44986					 Joash ordered the collection of funds from the cities of Judah (*2 Chr 24:5*) for **repairs . . . needed at the Temple.** Such **money** would come from special Levitical levies, a census tax (*2 Chr 24:9*), and voluntary offerings. After some time, **the priests still had not repaired the Temple.** So Joash took personal control of the project and put others in charge of the **repairs** (see also *study note on 2 Chr 24:4-8*).\n\n
12:9	idm44999					 Joash’s solution for securing and distributing the money for Temple repairs included placing **a large chest** at an accessible place to receive **the people’s contributions.** When Joash informed the people of the need for a tax and voluntary offerings to complete the repairs, they “gladly brought their money and filled the chest with it” (*2 Chr 24:9-10*). With sufficient funds on hand, the money was given to the **construction supervisors** and the repair and restoration of the Temple began.\n\n
12:17	idm45009					 **Hazael***,* a perennial oppressor of God’s people (*8:28*; *9:14-15*; *10:32-33*; *13:3*), had assassinated the Aramean king Ben-hadad II and seized the throne (*8:15*). Hazael’s campaign against Israel and Judah probably came after the death of the Assyrian king Shamshi-adad V in 811 BC and before Adad-nirari III (810–783 BC) launched a series of campaigns in 805 BC, leading to the capture of Damascus in 802 BC. Free of Assyria’s heavy hand, Hazael could launch a campaign southward. • Whether **Gath** is the well-known city of the Philistines (*1 Sam 5:8*; *6:17*) or a Hebrew city otherwise known as Gittaim (*2 Sam 4:3*; *Neh 11:33*) is disputed.\n\n
12:18	idm45031					 **Sacred objects . . . gold:** Such treasures had been contributed to the Temple earlier by Solomon and Asa (*1 Kgs 7:51*; *15:15*). • **Hazael** had already begun the **attack** against Jerusalem, and Joash was wounded during the battle (*2 Chr 24:25*). Paying tribute to **Hazael** may have prevented further destruction in the city.\n\n
12:20	idm45044					 The assassination of the king in 796 BC by some of his own **officers** was in reprisal for the murder of Jehoiada’s son Zechariah (*2 Chr 24:21-22*, *25*).\n\n
12:20	idm45054					 **Beth-millo:** This district lay on a ridge of the eastern hill of Jerusalem in an area known as the City of David, where Solomon installed a series of supporting terraces (*1 Kgs 9:15*). • **The road to Silla** is otherwise unknown.\n\n
13:1	idm45063					 **Jehoahaz** (814–798 BC) began his reign in Israel in the year that King Joash of Judah assumed direction of repairs on the Temple (*12:6*). Because Jehoahaz perpetuated the state religion instituted by Jeroboam I (*1 Kgs 12:26-33*), his spiritual evaluation was negative.\n\n
13:3	idm45073					 **Hazael***,* who had seized the throne of Aram in Damascus by assassinating his predecessor Ben-hadad II (*8:15*), continued the oppression of the northern kingdom. • **Ben-hadad** apparently served as a commander in Hazael’s forces until he succeeded his father as king in 802 BC.\n\n
13:4	idm45084					 **Jehoahaz prayed . . . the** Lord** heard:** Despite Jehoahaz’s poor spiritual condition, God graciously answered his prayer. The Lord graciously answers the earnest prayers of his people (see also *4:32-35*; *6:17-20*; *19:14-28*; *20:2-6*; *1 Kgs 3:8-14*; *13:4-6*; *17:21-23*; *18:36-39*; *Ps 34:4-7*; *Jas 5:16*). • **provided someone to rescue the Israelites** (cp. *Judg 3:9*, *15*): Scholars have suggested many possibilities for Israel’s rescuer, the most likely being King Adad-nirari III of Assyria, whose westward thrusts brought about the capture of Damascus in 802 BC.\n\n
13:6	idm45107					 Despite God’s rescue, Israel **continued to sin,** eventually resulting in the fall of the northern kingdom (*17:21-23*; *1 Kgs 14:15-16*). • This **Asherah pole** (a Canaanite fertility symbol erected by Ahab, *1 Kgs 16:33*) had apparently been spared in Jehu’s purge of Baal worship (*2 Kgs 10:26-29*).\n\n
13:7	idm45119					 Years of Aramean oppression severely **reduced** Israel’s **army**. Only God could save Israel from complete destruction (*13:4-5*). Ultimately, only God can rescue a helpless and lost humanity (*Ps 35:10*; *Rom 5:6-8*).\n\n
13:10	idm45130					 The narrator atypically combines the accession statement for **Jehoash** with the usual closing notice concerning his reign. This arrangement allows him to focus attention on some final details about Elisha (*13:14-21*) and Israel’s continuing problem with Aram (*13:22-25*) before returning to Jehoash’s **war with King Amaziah of Judah** in *14:8-14*. • **The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel:** See *study note on 1 Kgs 14:19-20*.\n\n
13:14	idm45143					 Jehoash **wept over** Elisha, showing that a faint glow of spiritual consciousness still existed in him. • **the chariots and charioteers of Israel:** Jehoash’s tribute to Elisha is reminiscent of Elisha’s words at Elijah’s departure (*2:12*).\n\n
13:15	idm45152					 **Elisha laid his own hands on the king’s hands:** This act conveyed spiritual empowerment for the upcoming battle with **the Arameans at Aphek**. • **Aphek** was situated east of the Sea of Galilee (*1 Kgs 20:26*), thus the **eastern window** faced the place where the battle would take place.\n\n
13:18	idm45163					 Jehoash failed to act on his knowledge that the arrows signified victory over Aram (*13:17*). By striking the ground only **three times***,* he unwittingly limited his own success against the Arameans; final victory came only later in the days of his son Jeroboam II (*14:25-28*).\n\n
13:20	idm45173					 Elisha’s death provides an opportunity to relate one final story about the prophet. • The **Moabite raiders** apparently timed their incursions into Israel to coincide with the early harvest and to precede the summer’s heat. • **The dead man revived** as his **body touched Elisha’s bones***,* a sign that Elisha’s prophecy would come true. Weakened Israel (*13:7*) would revive and repel the Aramean invaders (*13:25*; *14:25*; cp. *Ezek 37:1-14*).\n\n
13:23	idm45187					 Despite Israel’s continued infidelity, God remained faithful to **his covenant with Abraham** (*Gen 12:1-3*; *13:15-17*; *15:18-20*; *17:6-8*). By listing Abraham, **Isaac, and Jacob***,* the writer emphasizes Israel’s spiritual identity with the Lord and its possession of the land of promise (see *Gen 50:24*; *Exod 3:6*, *15-16*; *6:3*, *6-8*; *Deut 6:10*; *9:5*; *34:4*).\n\n
13:24	idm45208					 **Ben-hadad** son of **Hazael** came to the throne of Aram in Damascus in 802 BC, reigning twenty-two years in a declining kingdom. • Adad-nirari III of Assyria inflicted heavy losses against the Arameans (805–802 BC), allowing King **Jehoash** of Israel to further decimate this enemy. Fulfilling Elisha’s prophecy, Israel **defeated Ben-hadad on three occasions** and so recovered the Israelite **towns**. Jehoash’s limited success provided a springboard for Jeroboam II’s full-scale victories over the Arameans (*14:25*).\n\n
14:1	idm45222					 The **twenty-nine years** of **Amaziah**’s reign (796–767 BC) included a long co-regency with his son Uzziah (from 792 BC).\n\n
14:3	idm45232					 While Amaziah’s basic spiritual evaluation was satisfactory, he did not serve the Lord wholeheartedly as **his ancestor David** had (*2 Chr 25:2*). David continued to be the spiritual standard for evaluating the kings of Judah (*2 Kgs 16:2*; *18:3*; *1 Kgs 15:5*, *11*). Tolerance for long-established **pagan shrines** remained a stumbling block for Judah (*2 Kgs 12:3*; *1 Kgs 14:23*; *15:14*; *22:43*).\n\n
14:5	idm45249					 **When Amaziah . . . executed** his father’s assassins, he followed the standards of the law concerning **“Parents . . . crimes”** (*Deut 24:16*; see also *2 Chr 25:4*) and did not put their **children** to death.\n\n
14:7	idm45260					 **10,000 Edomites:** Amaziah’s victory, mentioned only briefly here, is discussed in detail in *2 Chr 25:5-15*. Despite granting Amaziah this victory, God chastised him both for hiring Israelite mercenaries and for carrying home Edomite gods and worshiping them. • **The Valley of Salt** was about three miles south of the Dead Sea. • **Sela** is traditionally identified as a site in the rocks and cliffs near Petra in modern Jordan. The capture of this highly defensible location demonstrated that Amaziah’s victory was God-given.\n\n
14:8	idm45270					 Amaziah’s **challenge to Israel’s King Jehoash** may have been provoked by thoughts of revenge (see *2 Chr 25:13*). Perhaps Amaziah had also become overly confident and proud because of his recent victory over Edom.\n\n
14:9	idm45278					 Jehoash’s reply came as a parable (see *Judg 9:7-15*). In essence, Amaziah had as much of a chance of defeating Israel in war as a **thistle** trying to make demands against a **mighty cedar tree**. Amaziah and Judah would be defeated as easily as a random step would crush the proud **thistle**.\n\n
14:11	idm45288					 **Beth-shemesh***,* a fortress town fifteen miles west of Jerusalem, was a natural place for the **battle** between Israel and Judah. The city history stretched back to when Judah occupied it after the Danites migrated northward (*Josh 21:16*; see also *1 Sam 6:1-14*; *2 Chr 28:18*).\n\n
14:13	idm45300					 The extensive demolition of **Jerusalem’s wall** and the thorough looting of the city testify to Jehoash’s overwhelming victory. Carrying off Temple and palace **treasures** and taking **hostages** are often noted in the annals of victorious Assyrian kings. See also *12:17-18*; *18:13-15*; *24:13-14*; *25:8-21*; *1 Kgs 14:25-26*.\n\n
14:17	idm45314					 Some suggest that Jehoash took Amaziah back to Samaria where he remained captive until Jehoash’s death. Subsequently released, Amaziah ruled jointly with his son Uzziah for fifteen years. • **The Book of the History of the Kings of Judah:** See *study note on 1 Kgs 14:29-31*.\n\n
14:19	idm45322					 Like his father Joash (*12:20-21*), Amaziah was killed by **assassins**. The Chronicler blames his spiritual infidelity for the **conspiracy against** him (*2 Chr 25:27*). • **Lachish***,* southwest of Jerusalem, was the site of an important victory by King Sennacherib of Assyria during his invasion of Judah in 701 BC (*2 Kgs 18:14*). It was also seized during Nebuchadnezzar II’s advance against Jerusalem in 588 BC (*Jer 34:7*).\n\n
14:21	idm45338					 The fifty-two year reign of **Uzziah** ended in 740 BC; he was **sixteen** years old when he became co-regent with his father in 792 BC. Apparently both Jehoash and Amaziah made their sons co-regents before going to war, in order to assure a smooth succession of government.\n\n
14:22	idm45348					 **Elath***,* built by Solomon (*2 Chr 8:17*) on the Gulf of Aqaba, provided an important commercial gateway to the Red Sea.\n\n
14:23	idm45357					 The **fifteenth year of King Amaziah’s reign in Judah** marks the beginning of Jeroboam II’s independent reign (782 BC). His reign of **forty-one** years includes the earlier co-regency with his father (793–782 BC).\n\n
14:24	idm45367					 Jeroboam II perpetuated the apostate religion instituted by Jeroboam I (*1 Kgs 12:28-33*) that led to Israel’s demise (*2 Kgs 17:21-23*; *1 Kgs 14:16*).\n\n
14:25	idm45376					 Israel and Judah apparently lived in harmony at this time so that both kingdoms prospered and **recovered** nearly all the territory that Solomon had held (see *2 Chr 26:6-15*). • **Lebo-hamath***,* known from Egyptian and Assyrian inscriptions, lay some forty-five miles north of Damascus in the Beqa‘ Valley. The extent of Jeroboam’s conquests testifies to the northern kingdom’s military power. Israel’s victories against the Arameans were possible because Aram had been weakened by earlier conquests of Adad-nirari III of Assyria. • **Jonah** is the famous **prophet** who pronounced the doom of Nineveh but was disappointed when God spared its repentant people (*Jon 3:3–4:3*).\n\n
14:26	idm45389					 **The** Lord** . . . used Jeroboam II:** God saw his people’s helplessness and remained faithful to the covenant established with Israel’s patriarchs (*13:23*). • **everything he did:** The narrator hints at the **extent** of Jeroboam’s God-given **power** and prosperity. The Samaria ostraca also indicate the prosperity of the era. The prophecies of Hosea and Amos show that despite the prosperity during Jeroboam’s reign, the Israelites refused to turn to the Lord.\n\n
15:1	idm45402					 The name **Uzziah** means *Yahweh is my strength.* • **fifty-two years:** The length of Uzziah’s reign (792–740 BC) reflects changed conditions in the early 700s BC. Assyria was in decline and relations between Israel and Judah were cordial. Uzziah’s spiritual convictions earned God’s blessing so that Judah enjoyed its greatest prosperity since the days of Solomon (*2 Chr 26:9-10*).\n\n
15:4	idm45414					 In spite of his good spiritual evaluation, Uzziah continued to allow worship at the **pagan shrines** (*14:4*).\n\n
15:5	idm45422					 Because Uzziah usurped the prerogatives of the priesthood (*2 Chr 26:16-21*), **the** Lord** struck the king with leprosy.** His son **Jotham** became co-regent (about 750 BC). While Uzziah’s **isolation** kept him from public duties, he may have continued to exercise political power. King Tiglath-pileser III of Assyria (744–727 BC), in connection with his first western campaign (744–743 BC), mentioned an opponent named Azariau whom many scholars understand as Uzziah.\n\n
15:8	idm45437					 Jeroboam II’s son **Zechariah** was far less capable than his father. Zechariah perpetuated **the sins that Jeroboam** [I] . . . **led Israel to commit**. God had promised Jehu a royal line **to the fourth generation** (*10:30*); Zechariah’s six-month reign fulfilled that promise.\n\n
15:13	idm45448					 **Jabesh***,* which lay east of the Jordan in northern Gilead, might have been the hometown of **Shallum***,* whose reign was even shorter than Zechariah’s. Shallum was assassinated, as he had done to Zechariah (*15:10*).\n\n
15:14	idm45459					 **Tirzah** had been capital of the northern kingdom during Israel’s first two dynasties (*1 Kgs 14:17*; *15:21*, *33*; *16:8*). • **Menahem** was an army commander.\n\n
15:16	idm45471					 At **Tirzah,** Menahem heard of King Zechariah’s assassination by Shallum. Menahem gathered his forces and moved against Samaria. • **ripped open the pregnant women:** This horrible wartime practice, noted in Assyrian and Babylonian documents, is also attributed to King Hazael of Aram (*8:12*). See also *Hos 10:14*; *13:16*; *Amos 1:13*.\n\n
15:19	idm45483					 **Tiglath-pileser:** The NLT uses the Assyrian (see *15:29*; *16:6*) form of the name, rather than the Hebrew form, *Pul*, which is taken from the Babylonian. Tiglath-pileser III seized the throne of Assyria in 744 BC and provided able leadership until his death in 727 BC. • When Tiglath-pileser launched the western campaign to regain territory held by Aram, Menahem paid him a heavy tribute of **thirty-seven tons of silver** to keep him from overrunning Israel. • Although Menahem’s name means *comfort,* the unsettled conditions in the northern kingdom provided little consolation for God’s people during his reign (752–742 BC).\n\n
15:23	idm45498					 Menahem’s son **Pekahiah** reigned only **two years** before Pekah **conspired** to assassinate him. Pekahiah continued the **sins** associated with the religious policies initiated by Jeroboam I (*1 Kgs 12:26-33*). **Pekah***,* an army commander, had apparently been a rival for the throne for some time.\n\n
15:27	idm45511					 **fifty-second year of King Uzziah’s reign:** The date for Pekah’s accession is the final year of Uzziah’s reign (740 BC). Because of the standing relationship between Tiglath-pileser and Menahem, Pekah confined his influence to Gilead during Menahem’s reign (752–742 BC). With Menahem’s death, Pekahiah made Pekah an army commander. This provided Pekah with a broader base of support and gave him opportunity to seize the throne of Israel in 740 BC.\n\n
15:29	idm45521					 With his second western campaign (734–732 BC), **Tiglath-pileser . . . attacked Israel again.** Pekah had allied himself with King Rezin of Aram in an ill-conceived anti-Assyrian coalition (see *Isa 9:1*). As a result of this invasion, Tiglath-pileser **captured** and **conquered** much of Israel’s northern and eastern territory. • Pekah’s doomed political policies caused dissension in **Israel** that led to his assassination by Hoshea, whose action was probably intended to placate the Assyrian king and preserve the northern kingdom. In his annals, Tiglath-pileser claimed that he put Hoshea on the throne and received his heavy tribute. • The **twentieth year of Jotham***,* counting from the beginning of his co-regency with his father Uzziah in Judah, was 732 BC, the year of his death.\n\n
15:32	idm45536					 **The second year of King Pekah’s reign** reflects the first full year of Jotham’s independent reign; he was co-regent with his father for the previous decade. • **sixteen years:** From the beginning of his co-regency with his father Uzziah (750 BC) until his son Ahaz became the primary ruler of Judah (735 BC).\n\n
15:34	idm45546					 Although **Jotham did what was pleasing in the** Lord**’s sight***,* he allowed worship at **pagan shrines** to continue. • **rebuilt the upper gate of the Temple:** The prosperity of Uzziah’s reign continued during his son Jotham’s reign. Jotham built onto Jerusalem’s wall at the hill of Ophel and did construction at many Judean sites (*2 Chr 27:3-4*). He also conquered the rebellious Ammonites (*2 Chr 27:5*), whom Uzziah had forced into subservience (*2 Chr 26:8*).\n\n
15:37	idm45561					 **Rezin . . . Pekah:** See *16:5*.\n\n
16:1	idm45569					 The **seventeenth year of King Pekah’s reign** was 735 BC. At that time **Ahaz . . . began to rule:** He had already been co-regent for eleven years, but now he officially acceded to the throne. This marks the transition from subordination to his father, Jotham (743–735 BC), to a position of reigning in his stead (735–732 BC). Ahaz presumably had his official accession ceremony following his father’s death in 732 BC, so the author of Kings reckons Ahaz’s reign of **sixteen years** from 731 BC, the year after his father died, to 715 BC. See also *study note on 17:1*.\n\n
16:2	idm45585					 Again, **his ancestor David** serves as the standard for measuring the spiritual character of Judah’s kings (*14:3*; *1 Kgs 15:3*, *11*). • **the example of the kings of Israel:** Ahaz was one of Judah’s most wicked kings. He indulged in the apostate religion of Israel and the **pagan** practices of other nations to the extent of **even sacrificing his own son in the fire** (see *Jer 19:5*; *32:35*). Although Levitical regulations prohibited such sacrifices as an abomination detestable to the Lord (*Lev 18:10*; *20:1-5*), the practice was repeated among God’s people (*Isa 30:33*; *Jer 7:31*) until Josiah’s reforms (*2 Kgs 23:10*).\n\n
16:5	idm45605					 **Rezin . . . Pekah:** This alliance between the kings of **Aram** and **Israel** was intended to free the area of Assyrian dominance under Tiglath-pileser III (*15:29-30*; *Isa 9:1*). The **attack** against **Judah** may have occurred to force Judah into the alliance or to replace the Judean king with one of their own choosing (*Isa 7:3-6*). The result was captivity and widespread death for the people of Judah (*2 Chr 28:5-15*). Isaiah reports that Rezin and Pekah intended to install a new king on Judah’s throne (*Isa 7:3-6*). Judah also suffered further attacks by the Edomites and Philistines (*2 Chr 28:17-18*). All of this was God’s will due to Ahaz’s detestable spiritual practices, which led to great sin among the people of Judah (*2 Chr 28:5*, *19*).\n\n
16:6	idm45624					 The NLT translators have chosen to follow the text of several ancient translations, since the town of **Elath** is far to the south, nearer to Edom than to Aram.\n\n
16:7	idm45631					 Rather than trusting in God’s provision (*Isa 7:7-16*), **Ahaz** petitioned **Tiglath-pileser** III of Assyria to **rescue** him from his enemies. Tiglath-pileser was successful, and his victory brought about the death of Rezin, the capture of Damascus, and the deportation of its citizens (732 BC). It also contributed to unseating Pekah as king of Israel in the same year (*2 Kgs 15:29-30*). The cost of the rescue was great, however; Ahaz paid a heavy tribute to Tiglath-pileser, and the Assyrian intervention reduced Judah to vassal status.\n\n
16:9	idm45643					 The location of **Kir** is unknown; it was the original home of the Arameans (*Amos 9:7*).\n\n
16:10	idm45651					 **Ahaz . . . took special note of the altar** of the Arameans and had a copy made so as to emulate their pagan worship.\n\n
16:12	idm45658					 **The king** initiated the new **altar** by making the traditional offerings upon it (see *Lev 1–3*; *Num 15:1-10*; *28:9-15*, *24*, *31*; *2 Kgs 6:8-23*; *7:11-20*). Sadly, such offerings upon a pagan altar by a leader devoid of spiritual character constituted a mockery of their deep spiritual meaning.\n\n
16:14	idm45673					 Solomon had originally placed the **bronze altar** in front of the **Temple** (see *Exod 40:6*; *2 Chr 4:1*; *7:7-10*). At first, Ahaz positioned his **new altar** so that worshipers would come to it before coming to the bronze altar. Then Ahaz had the bronze altar **placed . . . on the north side** of the new altar, completely replacing the bronze altar as the center of sacrificial activity.\n\n
16:15	idm45686					 Ahaz ordered that standard daily sacrifices (*Num 28:1-8*) as well as the individual **offerings** of the king and **people** would be made on the **new altar.** Ahaz then restricted the **bronze altar** to his **personal use** (literally *for seeking/inquiry*), probably to use it for pagan divination. This demand displayed a callous insolence against the Lord and his worship. **Uriah the priest** complied with Ahaz’s demands (*2 Kgs 16:10-11*, *16*), rather than resisting the king.\n\n
16:17	idm45702					 Because the **side panels and basins from the . . . water carts** and the **Sea** were made of **bronze** (see *1 Kgs 7:25-40*), Ahaz might have used them to pay tribute or for some other project. • **In deference: **Apparently at the request of **the king of Assyria***,* Ahaz removed **the canopy** that led to the inner court as well as to the king’s private **entrance to the Temple**. Judah paid a heavy price in loss of freedom because of Ahaz’s trust in the Assyrian king’s military intervention on their behalf (*2 Kgs 16:7-8*, *10*).\n\n
16:19	idm45719					 **The rest of the events in Ahaz’s reign:** In further rejection of the Lord, Ahaz removed the utensils from the Temple “and broke them into pieces” (*2 Chr 28:24*). He then closed the Temple and discontinued services there, instead promoting paganism throughout the land (*2 Chr 28:25*; *29:7*). In redefining the worship of Judah so completely, his apostasy was similar to that of Jeroboam I (cp. *2 Kgs 3:3*; *13:2*; *16:2-4*; *17:21*; *1 Kgs 12:25-33*; *16:26*; *22:52*)\n\n
17:1	idm45736					 The report of the northern kingdom’s fall proceeds in two major sections: (1) events in the reign of Israel’s final king, Hoshea, and the circumstances that brought about the capture of Samaria and the deportation of Israel’s citizens (*17:1-6*); (2) the reasons for Israel’s collapse and conquest by Assyria—Israel’s many sins (*17:7-17*) that merited God’s judgment (*17:18-20*) and the great sin of Jeroboam I, who laid the foundation for Israel’s rampant apostasy (*17:21-23*).\n\n
17:1	idm45746					 **Hoshea . . . began to rule over Israel** in 732 BC. • Hoshea’s reign is listed as beginning in “the twentieth year of Jotham” (*15:30*) and in **the twelfth year of King Ahaz’s reign in Judah.** Ahaz apparently co-reigned with Jotham from about 743 BC, when he was twelve years old, but Ahaz’s official regnal years were calculated from 731 BC (*16:2*). Thus the references to Ahaz’s reign are in harmony.\n\n
17:2	idm45759					 Hoshea’s **evil** deeds were **not to the same extent** as his forebears, though what this means exactly is not explained.\n\n
17:3	idm45767					 **King Shalmaneser** V succeeded his father Tiglath-pileser III in 726 BC. **Hoshea** may have reasoned that this leadership change would allow Israel to become independent of Assyrian vassalage. But his withholding of the **annual tribute** simply invited Shalmaneser’s reprisal. • **by asking King So of Egypt:** Some scholars understand the name *So* as an abbreviation of Pharaoh Osorkon IV (730–715 BC). Others equate *So* with Pharaoh Piankhy (747–716 BC), viewing the biblical name *So* as a Hebraic rendering of one of the names in Piankhy’s titulary. Still others suggest that *So* refers to the city of *Sais,* the capital of Pharaoh Tefnakht (727–720 BC). Whatever the identity of this king, it is clear that Hoshea’s hope for help from Egypt was misplaced.\n\n
17:5	idm45786					 **the king of Assyria:** Although sources identify Samaria’s conqueror as Shalmaneser V of Assyria (726–722 BC), Sargon II (who ruled Assyria 721–705 BC) claimed that he captured the city. Perhaps Sargon was the field commander when Samaria fell and then became king when Shalmaneser died during the year of the siege. • **invaded the entire land:** Assyrian military strategy was to devastate the territory surrounding an enemy’s primary city before launching a final attack. • **The ninth year of King Hoshea’s reign** was 722 BC. • **the people . . . were exiled:** The Assyrians practiced deportation in order to defuse future rebellions. Sargon also brought other people to Israel to form a mixed population (*17:24-25*). • **Halah** was situated northeast of Nineveh in Assyria. • **The Habor River** is a tributary of the Euphrates River in northwestern Assyria. • **Gozan** was located on the **Habor River** northeast of Haran (*Gen 12:4*). Assyrian documents from the area list personal names that are clearly Israelite, perhaps reflecting the deportation of the people of Samaria.\n\n
17:7	idm45805					 **sinned against the** Lord** . . . who had brought them . . . out of Egypt:** Israel’s demise was due to the people’s persistent sin of infidelity. Rather than remaining true to their Redeemer, the Israelites **worshiped other gods.** • Israel’s redemption **out of Egypt** is a theme repeated throughout the Old Testament, appearing in the poetic literature (*Exod 15:1-18*; *Pss 77:13-20*; *105:26-45*; *106:7-12*; *114:1-8*; *Hab 3:3-15*), the prophets (*Isa 63:11-14*; *Jer 2:1-8*; *32:21-23*; *Ezek 20:10-12*; *Mic 6:4*), and the historical literature (*Josh 3:5*; *4:14*, *18-24*; *1 Sam 12:6*).\n\n
17:8	idm45831					 The catalog of Israel’s sins includes numerous **pagan** rites and **practices.** Whether done in the open or **secretly***,* God was aware of them all. Many were even initiated by Israel’s kings who built **pagan shrines***,* **sacred pillars***,* **and Asherah poles** and emulated heathen **sacrifices** and idolatry (*10:29*; *15:18*, *28*; *1 Kgs 12:28-33*; *15:34*; *16:30-33*). All levels of Israelite society, royalty and commoner alike, persisted in such sins despite denunciation and warning by God’s **prophets***,* which included the writings of Isaiah, Hosea, Amos, and Micah.\n\n
17:11	idm45855					 **arousing the** Lord**’s anger:** When God becomes angry, he is not vindictive or bad tempered. Instead, human evil angers him because people have rebelled against God and done evil to one another. God responds to human evil with his justice in dealing with sin and evil (see also *13:3*; *17:17-18*; *21:6*; *22:13*, *17*; *23:26-27*; *24:20*; *Rom 3:23*; *6:23*; *14:10*; *2 Cor 5:10*; *Col 3:6*; *1 Jn 1:8-10*).\n\n
17:14	idm45877					 Like their **ancestors** (*Deut 10:16*; *1 Sam 12:6-9*; *Ps 106:28*), **the Israelites** persisted in their infidelity to the Lord (*Isa 65:6-7*; *Amos 2:4*; see *Acts 7:51-53*).\n\n
17:16	idm45891					 **all the commands of the** Lord**:** The narrator lists specific examples of Israel’s disobedience: the **two calves** made **from metal** erected at Dan and Bethel (*1 Kgs 12:28-30*), the Canaanite fertility symbol known as **an Asherah pole** (*2 Kgs 13:6*; *17:10*; *1 Kgs 14:23*; *16:33*; *Mic 5:14*), the persistent worship of **Baal** (*1 Kgs 16:31-33*; *Hos 2:13*; *13:1*), and the detestable Molech rites (*2 Kgs 16:3*; *Ps 106:37*).\n\n
17:18	idm45915					 **the** Lord** was very angry:** God’s wrath is his righteous response to evil that demands his justice. • **even the people of Judah refused to obey the commands of the** Lord**:** This remark foreshadows the eventual fall of the southern kingdom as well (*25:1-21*).\n\n
17:21	idm45928					 All of Israel’s evil and disobedience were connected to the sins of **Jeroboam** I (*1 Kgs 12:26-33*).\n\n
17:24	idm45936					 The writer appends information concerning later events in Israel, including the repopulation of the land with foreigners and the syncretistic worship that developed among the mixed population.\n\n
17:24	idm45942					 Not only were the Israelites exiled to other places held by the Assyrians (*17:6*), but **groups of people** were sent to settle in Israel. By mixing diverse peoples, the Assyrians hoped to have better control of the resulting population and transfer their loyalties to **Assyria**. • **Samaria** became the official name of the new Assyrian province.\n\n
17:26	idm45952					 **The king of Assyria** was Sargon II (721–705 BC). • **the God of the land . . . has sent lions:** Religious belief in the ancient Near East held that the tranquility and success of a land was strongly identified with its god and the rites associated with his worship. • **One of the priests . . . returned to Bethel***,* though his instruction in **how to worship the** Lord was doubtless influenced by the religion of Jeroboam I and mixed with paganism. • The **foreigners also continued to worship their own gods.** They simply added the worship of Israel’s God to the worship of their own gods. Most of the false *gods* mentioned here are unknown. Their names may have been altered by Jewish scribes. • **Nergal** was the Mesopotamian god of the underworld. **Nibhaz and Tartak** were probably Elamite deities.\n\n
17:32	idm45969					 **worshiped the** Lord**, but . . . continued to follow their own gods:** Hebrew faith, already blended with the religion of Jeroboam I, was now mixed with many different foreign religious customs. Genuine worship of the Lord virtually disappeared. Only a handful of faithful Israelites remained to respond to Hezekiah’s later invitation to come to Judah for the Passover celebration (*2 Chr 30:10-19*).\n\n
17:35	idm45979					 According to Israel’s **covenant** with **the** Lord (*Exod 20:5*; *Deut 6:4-15*), Israel was to **worship only the** Lord. He alone could provide true redemption and **rescue** them **from all . . . enemies**.\n\n
17:40	idm45994					 **worshiped the** Lord** . . . worshiped their idols:** The reconstituted Samaritan religion was thoroughly syncretistic (an eclectic combination of religions), perhaps explaining why Samaritans were later regarded with suspicion and disdain (see *Neh 4:1-2*; *10:28-31*; *John 4:7-9*).\n\n
18:1	idm46006					 The accession statement concerning **Hezekiah**’s reign (*18:1-2*) is accompanied by a lengthy evaluation of Hezekiah’s spiritual commitment (*18:3-7a*), followed by background details of the political situation in his time (*18:7b-12*).\n\n
18:1	idm46016					 **the third year of King Hoshea’s reign in Israel:** The date given for **Hezekiah**’s accession refers to his co-regency with his father, Ahaz. Since Hoshea began his reign in 732 BC, Hezekiah **began to rule** in about 728 BC, when he was twelve years old. When Ahaz died in 715 BC, Hezekiah began his sole reign at age **twenty-five**. This marks the start of his reign of **twenty-nine years** (715–686 BC).\n\n
18:3	idm46031					 Unlike Ahaz (*16:2*), Hezekiah compared favorably with **David**. Hezekiah destroyed false objects of worship, including the **pagan shrines . . . sacred pillars, and . . . Asherah poles** (see *16:3-10*; *17:9-11*, *19*). • Apparently the **bronze serpent** used by **Moses** (*Num 21*) had become an object of illicit worship.\n\n
18:5	idm46046					 **Hezekiah trusted in the** Lord**:** He was without peer **among all the kings of Judah**. Later, Josiah was without equal in upholding the law of Moses (*23:25*). These two kings were models of piety in times of diminishing spirituality.\n\n
18:7	idm46057					 Because of Hezekiah’s unparalleled spiritual commitment, God blessed him and he was **successful in everything he did**. Hezekiah began a series of reforms, including the cleansing, repair, and refurbishing of the Temple (*2 Chr 29:3-36*); observance of the Passover (*2 Chr 30*); and the reconstituting of vital worship in Judah (*2 Chr 31:1-19*). • **He revolted against the king of Assyria:** In the ancient Near East, rebellion and the withholding of **tribute** usually took place with the change of government; King Sennacherib of Assyria succeeded Sargon II in 704 BC. Assyria’s preoccupation with matters in southern Mesopotamia at this time might have emboldened Hezekiah. Assyria’s response was to invade Judah in 701 BC (*18:13–19:36*). • **He also conquered the Philistines***,* who had been a menace during Ahaz’s reign (*2 Chr 28:18*).\n\n
18:9	idm46075					 The narrator introduces the fall of Samaria as a reminder that Assyria was the prevailing power of the era and that Samaria fell because of Hoshea’s apostasy, thus setting the stage for the account of Hezekiah’s demonstration of spiritual fiber and God’s dealing with him (*18:19–19:19*).\n\n
18:13	idm46082					 The annals of **King Sennacherib of Assyria** describe this invasion during his third military campaign. He advanced swiftly down the Mediterranean coast through the Phoenician cities and into Philistine territory, then turned inland.\n\n
18:14	idm46089					 **Lachish** lay southwest of Jerusalem, not far from the Philistine border. • **I have done wrong** (literally *I have sinned*). Hezekiah’s message to Sennacherib was in well-chosen diplomatic language. • Sennacherib claimed that in addition to the **eleven tons of silver and one ton of gold,** he received from Hezekiah many jewels and rich treasures as well as Hezekiah’s own daughter, the women of his harem, and his male and female singers.\n\n
18:15	idm46099					 Hezekiah paid a heavy price for refusing to pay tribute money to the king of Assyria. Now, to satisfy Sennacherib’s demands he emptied the silver and gold from the **Temple** and **the palace treasury** (cp. *2 Chr 16:1-9*).\n\n
18:17	idm46108					 **sent . . . a huge army:** In spite of Hezekiah’s lavish payment, Sennacherib had no intention of being sidetracked from invading Jerusalem. • **beside the aqueduct:** The meeting place of the two delegations is believed to be a location on Jerusalem’s northwestern wall; this spot had also served as the meeting place between Isaiah and Ahaz (*Isa 7:3-16*).\n\n
18:19	idm46117					 In earlier days, the term **great king** was reserved for the kings of the leading military powers, but it had become a standard epithet for Assyrian kings. • **What are you trusting in?** The Assyrian officer asserted that the citizens of Jerusalem, faced with Assyria’s overwhelming **military** superiority, would be foolish to trust in Hezekiah’s words. Similarly, soliciting help from **Egypt** would be foolish. Finally, the chief of staff argued that trust **in the** Lord would also be misplaced. Perhaps the officer hoped to gain the loyalty of citizens who had worshiped at the **shrines and altars** that Hezekiah had destroyed.\n\n
18:23	idm46130					 The officer next turned to taunting, suggesting that Jerusalem would be unable to field sufficient manpower and strength to withstand even the **weakest contingent of** Assyrian **troops**.\n\n
18:25	idm46138					 The chief of staff concluded his argument by claiming that Jerusalem’s situation was hopeless because the Assyrians had come at **the** Lord**’s direction** to **destroy** Judah. To oppose the great king was to oppose God himself!\n\n
18:26	idm46148					 Hezekiah’s representatives wanted the Assyrian delegation to **speak . . . in Aramaic***,* the language of diplomacy, so that the **people** who were listening would not understand and be discouraged or frightened.\n\n
18:27	idm46157					 **my master . . . wants all the people to hear:** The Assyrians used the native tongue of a besieged city as part of their psychological warfare.\n\n
18:28	idm46164					 **The chief of staff** ignored the request of Hezekiah’s delegation and **shouted in Hebrew***,* hoping to arouse fear among the people of Jerusalem.\n\n
18:31	idm46173					 The Assyrian chief of staff then detailed the generous **terms** Sennacherib was offering for their surrender. Why die? **Choose life!**\n\n
18:32	idm46181					 **The** Lord** will rescue us:** The chief of staff continued his psychological taunting by asserting that the Lord was just like **the gods** of the **other nations** and could not save Judah. • **Arpad** was a city-state located northwest of Aleppo. Like **Hamath***,* it was a hub of Aramean activity and is mentioned on other occasions in the Old Testament (see *Isa 10:9*; *Jer 49:23*).\n\n
18:37	idm46197					 **tore their clothes in despair:** This action could have been both a sign of sorrow over the situation in Jerusalem (see *6:30*) and an indication of grief over the blasphemous insults of the Assyrian official (see *19:4-6*).\n\n
19:1	idm46206					 **Hezekiah** showed his grief in the same way his representatives had (see *Joel 1:13*). He wisely went to the **Temple***,* where he laid bare his soul before God in heartfelt worship and supplication (see *Pss 5:7*; *48:9-10*; *63:1-3*).\n\n
19:2	idm46219					 Leaders often consulted prophets like **Isaiah** in emergencies (*3:11-12*) or before going into battle (*1 Kgs 22:8-10*); Isaiah was active throughout Hezekiah’s reign (*2 Kgs 20:1*, *14*). • The expression **a day of trouble** describes the heart-wrenching distress the king was experiencing because of the blasphemous **insults and disgrace** that God and his people were being forced to endure. Hezekiah realized that he and the people were powerless without God’s intervention.\n\n
19:4	idm46232					 Hezekiah was not denying his own relationship to **the** Lord by referring to him as **your God***;* rather, he was acknowledging God’s special call upon Isaiah.\n\n
19:8	idm46242					 Sennacherib had dispatched his officers and forces to Jerusalem while he was attacking **Lachish** (*18:14*, *17*). He had now moved eight miles to the northeast, to **Libnah.**\n\n
19:9	idm46252					 **King Tirhakah of Ethiopia** would later become pharaoh over Egypt. At this time he was a commander in his brother Shebitku’s army.\n\n
19:10	idm46259					 Sennacherib’s second message reminded the people of Jerusalem of the Assyrians’ ruthless victories; it was common knowledge that the **kings of Assyria** had plundered, tortured, mutilated (see *19:28*), and **completely destroyed** everyone who stood in their way. No nation, king, or god had been able to resist them. In the face of this threat, the people would be wiser to trust their common sense and surrender rather than trust Hezekiah and his deceptive piety.\n\n
19:14	idm46268					 **Hezekiah received** Sennacherib’s blasphemous **letter** and immediately took it **to theinto the house of the** Lord**’s Temple**. His **prayer** to God was a lament of praise (*19:15*) and petition (*19:16-19*).\n\n
19:16	idm46282					 Sennacherib’s successes were irrelevant because—unlike the **gods of these nations***,* who were **not gods at all**—Yahweh was the **living God**.\n\n
19:21	idm46292					 The phrase **virgin daughter** is often used regarding civic identity (*Isa 23:12*; *37:22*; *47:1*; *Jer 18:13*). Here, the metaphor implies that as a young maiden is rescued from her attacker, so God will rescue Jerusalem. The Lord’s answer was delivered as a “taunt song,” a common literary form in the ancient Near East that rejoiced over an enemy’s humiliation (cp. *Isa 14:3-20*).\n\n
19:23	idm46304					 **highest mountains . . . of Lebanon:** In his annals, Sennacherib told of scaling high mountain passes and felling Lebanon’s great **trees**. Sennacherib felt invincible, but he was a mere man, no match for the omniscient Lord of the universe (*1 Chr 28:9*).\n\n
19:25	idm46313					 **I am making it happen:** All of Sennacherib’s great accomplishments were what God had planned for him.\n\n
19:27	idm46320					 **I know you well:** See *Pss 44:21*; *94:11*. • **hook . . . bit:** The Assyrian annals mention similar mistreatment of prisoners; the Lord would do to Sennacherib what he and his predecessors had done to those they subjugated.\n\n
19:29	idm46330					 **Here is the proof:** The Lord’s message of encouragement included a sign that Jerusalem would be rescued from the siege. The sign was God’s provision of food. Because the land had suffered devastation by the Assyrians, the people would need to depend on random crop growth for their survival. The food supply would also remain scarce as the **next year** came. But by **the third year***,* there would be a return to regular planting and harvesting.\n\n
19:31	idm46340					 The theme of the **remnant** occurs frequently in the Old Testament. God’s preservation of his people often serves as a promise of his care for them in the distant future (see *Isa 4:2-6*; *9:1-7*; *Zeph 3:8-20*; cp. *Rev 7:1-12*). God’s people can be assured of their survival, for the **commitment of the** Lord** . . . will make this happen**.\n\n
19:32	idm46354					 Sennacherib’s **armies** did not **enter Jerusalem** but returned home. In Sennacherib’s own account, he gave details of capturing and despoiling forty-six cities of Judah. He made no mention of the capture of *Jerusalem* but recorded only that he shut up Hezekiah “in Jerusalem . . . like a bird in a cage.” • **For my own honor**—in light of Sennacherib’s blasphemies and arrogance against God (*18:25*, *28-30*; *19:10-13*, *21*, *27-28*)—**and for the sake of my servant David***,* to whom God had made his covenant promise (*2 Sam 7:8-16*) and whose faith Hezekiah had emulated (*2 Kgs 18:3*), the Lord would **defend this city** (see *20:6*). The Lord decisively demonstrated that he alone is God and that he is faithful to his people who trust in him.\n\n
19:35	idm46376					 **The angel of the** Lord had similarly been active in the rescue of God’s people from Egypt (*Exod 12:12-13*, *23*).\n\n
19:36	idm46386					 **Sennacherib . . . went home . . . and stayed there:** Although this Assyrian king went on five more military campaigns, he did not return to attack Judah.\n\n
19:37	idm46393					 **his sons . . . killed him:** Although Sennacherib’s assassination took place twenty years later in 681 BC, the narrator includes it here to conclude his discussion of the Assyrian king and to point out the irony in his death. He had boasted that no gods were able to rescue the peoples he attacked, yet his god failed to defend him against assassins from his own family! • At Sennacherib’s death, his **son, Esarhaddon,** succeeded him and reigned until 669 BC.\n\n
20:1	idm46403					 **About that time:** This general time reference indicates that the order of events is thematic rather than chronological. The episode concerning Merodach-baladan (*20:12-19*), whom Sennacherib had driven from Babylon before 701 BC, happened earlier than the events of chs *18–19* but after Hezekiah’s illness (*20:12*).\n\n
20:1	idm46414					 Since **Isaiah** was already active in Hezekiah’s reign before Sennacherib moved to take Jerusalem, he was readily available to the king during that emergency (*19:2*). • **Set your affairs in order:** Hezekiah’s **illness** was terminal.\n\n
20:2	idm46424					 Unlike Ahab, who went to bed in a royal pout (*1 Kgs 21:4*), **Hezekiah . . . turned his face to the wall and prayed**.\n\n
20:5	idm46432					 Hezekiah’s commitment to the Lord compared favorably with that of his **ancestor David** (*18:3*). Just as God had heard David’s prayers (*Pss 6:8-9*; *28:6-7*; *31:22*; *40:1-2*), he would answer Hezekiah’s plea.\n\n
20:6	idm46444					 When God added more **years** to Hezekiah’s **life***,* he also promised to **defend** Jerusalem. When Hezekiah reacted to Sennacherib’s later invasion (*19:14-19*) by seeking counsel from Isaiah (*19:2*), he was following an established precedent. • **for my own honor and for . . . David:** God reminded Hezekiah of this promise during Sennacherib’s invasion (*19:34*).\n\n
20:8	idm46458					 Hezekiah’s request for a **sign** as proof of his healing is understandable. He had quickly moved from having an incurable illness to being promised fifteen more years of life. God sometimes provided signs as visible symbols of his intentions (see also *19:29*; *Gen 9:12-17*; *Exod 4:1-9*; *12:12-13*; *31:12-13*, *17*; *1 Kgs 13:1-3*).\n\n
20:10	idm46472					 **ten steps backward:** Such a retreat of the **shadow** was contrary to nature, and the miracle confirmed God’s message to Hezekiah.\n\n
20:12	idm46480					 **Merodach-baladan** reigned over Babylon from 721 to 710 BC, when Sargon of Assyria forced him to flee. He ruled again briefly in 703 BC. This visit was likely during his exile; he probably sent **envoys** bearing his **best wishes and a gift** because he needed an ally against Assyria. • **There was nothing . . . that Hezekiah did not show them:** Hezekiah showed **the Babylonian envoys** his vast **treasuries***,* which had not yet been sent to Sennacherib (*18:13-16*). However, his attempt to impress his visitors was misguided (*20:16-18*).\n\n
20:17	idm46497					 **everything . . . will be carried off to Babylon:** The Lord’s message through Isaiah predicted the taking of the **palace . . . treasures** in Jerusalem to **Babylon***,* an event that took place in 597–586 BC (*24:10-17*; *25:1-21*).\n\n
20:18	idm46510					 **Some of your very own sons will be taken:** Hezekiah’s son Manasseh was taken as a prisoner to Babylon (*2 Chr 33:11-13*). This prophecy found ultimate fulfillment in Hezekiah’s descendants during the Babylonian deportations of 605 BC (see *2 Kgs 24:1* and *corresponding study note*; *Dan 1:1-7*), 597 BC (*2 Kgs 24:10-12*; *2 Chr 36:10*), and 586 BC (*2 Kgs 25:5-7*; *2 Chr 36:20*; *Jer 39:1-7*; *52:4-15*).\n\n
20:20	idm46530					 For more on **the extent of his power***,* see *18:7-8*; *2 Chr 32:27-29*. • In the face of Sennacherib’s threat, Hezekiah constructed a 1,777-foot **tunnel** that brought water from outside the city walls into Jerusalem (*2 Chr 32:1-5*, *30*) to a **pool** called the Pool of Siloam. An inscription discovered in AD 1880 commemorates this engineering feat.\n\n
21:1	idm46545					 **fifty-five years:** Manasseh’s long reign (697–642 BC) certainly cannot be attributed to his faithfulness to the Lord but to the Lord’s continued honoring of his covenant promises (see also *8:19*; *19:34*; *20:6*; *2 Sam 7:11-16*). External conditions were largely stable. Though the Assyrian kings Esarhaddon (680–669 BC) and Ashurbanipal (668–626 BC) conducted a number of military campaigns, none was directed against Judah until later in Manasseh’s reign, probably around 650–648 BC (see *2 Chr 33:10-13*). Ashurbanipal’s attention was on building projects, religious pursuits, and the arts, including a great library. • **He did what was evil:** Manasseh was the most wicked of Judah’s kings; discussion of his reign focuses on his evil religious practices.\n\n
21:3	idm46562					 Manasseh’s spiritual infidelity included rebuilding local **pagan shrines** that his father had destroyed (*18:3*). He also promoted wicked religious practices associated with the worship of **Baal and set up an Asherah pole** (see *18:3*; *1 Kgs 16:32*) and reintroduced astral worship. God had judged the northern kingdom for these sins (*2 Kgs 17:16*).\n\n
21:6	idm46574					 Manasseh’s wickedness included participation in the abominable Molech rites and all manner of forbidden cult and occult practices (*16:3*; see *Lev 18:21*). • **the** Lord**’s . . . anger:** God responded to Manasseh’s detestable religious practices with his righteous judgment, just as he had with the northern kingdom (*2 Kgs 17:18-20*).\n\n
21:11	idm46586					 The **Amorites** were the pre-Israelite inhabitants of the **land***,* known for their wickedness. • Manasseh practiced the idolatry of the **Amorites** as Ahab had done (*1 Kgs 21:26*).\n\n
21:12	idm46597					 Based on what had happened to the northern kingdom (*17:7-23*) and to Ahab’s family (*9:24-26*, *30-37*; *10:1-8*; *1 Kgs 22:37-38*), Manasseh should fully expect God to execute justice against him and the people of **Judah.**\n\n
21:14	idm46609					 **the remnant:** Those not killed in God’s impending judgment would be at the mercy of their captors. This prophecy was fulfilled when thousands of Judeans were taken into captivity in the Babylonian invasion during the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC (*25:8-21*; *2 Chr 36:20*; *Jer 39:9*; *52:15*).\n\n
21:16	idm46621					 **innocent blood:** Beyond his loathsome spiritual **sin***,* Manasseh was guilty of murder. Jewish tradition holds that Isaiah was one of many prophets that Manasseh put to death.\n\n
21:17	idm46630					 **everything he did:** The Chronicler records that Manasseh was captured by an Assyrian king, probably when King Ashurbanipal resided in Babylon (about 650–648 BC). This experience humbled Manasseh and brought repentance. After his release, he attempted spiritual reforms, but they were too late in his reign to be effective (*2 Chr 33:11-17*).\n\n
21:18	idm46639					 **The garden of Uzza** is otherwise unknown (but see also *21:26*). Unlike his father, Hezekiah, who had been buried with honor, Manasseh was not buried in the royal tombs (*2 Chr 32:33*).\n\n
21:19	idm46648					 **Amon**’s brief reign (642–640 BC) simply perpetuated his father’s wickedness. Manasseh’s repentance and reforms came too late to have any effect on Amon or on the people of Judah. • **He abandoned the** Lord**:** Amon became a total apostate (see also *2 Chr 33:23*).\n\n
21:26	idm46660					 Like his father, Manasseh (*21:17*), Amon was denied burial in the royal tombs and was interred in **the garden of Uzza**.\n\n
22:1	idm46668					 **Josiah** ascended the throne of Judah in 640 BC. Like Joash (*11:21*), he was still a boy when he became king. He was faithful to the Lord, comparing favorably with David, like Asa (*1 Kgs 15:11*) and Hezekiah (*2 Kgs 18:3*). • **doing what was right:** Josiah’s conduct met the high standards of the law (*Deut 17:11*; *28:14*).\n\n
22:3	idm46682					 By **the eighteenth year of his reign** (621 BC), Josiah had been devoted to the Lord for ten years (see *2 Chr 34:3-7*). • **Hilkiah the high priest** was from the line of Zadok (*1 Chr 9:10-11*). Some scholars suggest that this Hilkiah was Jeremiah’s father (*Jer 1:1*). • Apparently the **money** was **collected** in a large chest convenient to the people as they came to the Temple (cp. *12:9*).\n\n
22:5	idm46697					 Josiah’s instructions to Shaphan were similar to those given by Joash for restoring the **Temple** during his reign (*12:10-15*).\n\n
22:8	idm46705					 The scroll known as **the Book of the Law** might have contained all or part of Deuteronomy or even the entire Pentateuch (cp. *Deut 31:26*). How it had become lost or where it was **found** in the **Temple** is unknown. **Shaphan** reported the momentous discovery immediately and **read it to the king**.\n\n
22:11	idm46717					 Like Hezekiah before him (*19:1*), Josiah **tore his clothes** in genuine grief for his own spiritual condition and that of the people of Judah. • **have not obeyed the words in this scroll:** The portion that **Shaphan** read to Josiah apparently reminded him of God’s claim upon his people, the need for faithfulness to the covenant, and the penalties for infidelity (see *Deut 28*). Recognizing that Judah had failed to obey the law, Josiah rightly feared **the** Lord**’s great anger**.\n\n
22:14	idm46731					 **The prophet Huldah . . . was the wife of Shallum:** Some have suggested that this Shallum was related to Jeremiah (*Jer 32:7-12*). Huldah’s family relationships might have allowed her to serve as a sort of court prophet (see also *2 Chr 34:22-28*).\n\n
22:15	idm46740					 **The** Lord** . . . has spoken!** Like Miriam (*Exod 15:20*) and Deborah (*Judg 4:4*), Huldah had the privilege of proclaiming God’s will to the people. Huldah confirmed Josiah’s fears that God would **bring disaster** on Jerusalem because of the people’s unfaithfulness and many sins.\n\n
22:18	idm46752					 God commended Josiah’s sorrow and humility in response to the reading of God’s word. Although God’s judgment was certain, he would withhold it until after Josiah’s death.\n\n
23:1	idm46758					 In the spirit of the instructions of Deuteronomy (*Deut 31:10-13*) and like Joshua before him (*Josh 8:34-35*), Josiah **summoned . . . all the people** to hear the reading of **the entire Book of the Covenant**.\n\n
23:3	idm46768					 **The king . . . renewed the covenant:** Covenant renewal was observed at several critical points in the history of God’s people (see *11:12*, *17*; *Josh 24:1-27*; *1 Kgs 8:1-53*).\n\n
23:4	idm46779					 **remove . . . all the articles:** Josiah eliminated from the Temple detestable items associated with pagan worship. • **terraces of the Kidron Valley:** This area, near the Valley of Ben-Hinnom where the loathsome Molech rituals of child sacrifice had been carried out, became a place where **ashes** and dead bodies were taken (*Jer 26:23*). • Taking the **ashes away to Bethel***,* where Jeroboam had erected one of his cult altars (*1 Kgs 12:28-29*), would defile the site forever.\n\n
23:5	idm46792					 Josiah stopped the **idolatrous priests** from officiating over pagan rituals. He also demolished the **living quarters** of the cult **prostitutes**. Manasseh and Amon apparently had allowed the prostitution carried over from Canaanite practices (see *1 Kgs 14:24*; *15:12*; *22:46*) to be practiced within the **Temple** itself.\n\n
23:8	idm46805					 **The gate of Joshua** is otherwise unknown; it might have been used by the city **governor***,* a title known to refer to a city official in Samaria (*1 Kgs 22:26*; *2 Chr 18:25*) and to Maaseiah in Jerusalem (*2 Chr 34:8*).\n\n
23:10	idm46817					 **Topheth** was a precinct in **the valley of Ben-Hinnom***,* which lay southwest of the city of David and led into the Kidron Valley. The detestable rite of child sacrifice had occurred there. • **Molech** has been identified with a number of deities (see *1 Kgs 11:5*, *7*, *33*) and with the name of a sacrifice offered to Baal (*Jer 7:31-32*; *19:5-6*; *32:35*).\n\n
23:11	idm46833					 The **horse** was used in **sun** worship in the ancient Near East. The Assyrian sun-god Shamash and other deities were depicted riding across the sky in horse-drawn chariots. Archaeological evidence suggests that a solar cult existed in Israel as early as the 800s BC. The cult’s popularity likely increased during the reigns of Manasseh and Amon, when it was sponsored by the crown (*21:3-5*, *21-22*). Despite Josiah’s reforms, shortly after his death Ezekiel denounced the sun worshipers again for performing their rituals within the inner court of the Temple (*Ezek 8:16*). • **the eunuch, an officer of the court:** The term translated *eunuch* can refer not only to those who were physically eunuchs but also to high officials.\n\n
23:12	idm46847					 **upper room of Ahaz:** Roof-top **altars** were used for astral worship (*Jer 19:13*; *Zeph 1:5*) and rituals associated with Baal (*Jer 32:29*).\n\n
23:13	idm46858					 **Solomon** had erected **the pagan shrines** because of his many foreign wives (*1 Kgs 11:5*, *7*, *33*).\n\n
23:15	idm46869					 **Jeroboam** had built **the altar at Bethel** to encourage Israelites to worship at centers closer to home rather than going to Jerusalem (*1 Kgs 12:26-31*). Josiah’s desecration of the site followed the stipulations of the law (*Deut 7:5*; *12:3*) and fulfilled the earlier prophecy of **the man of God** who had denounced **the altar** (*1 Kgs 13:1-3*).\n\n
23:19	idm46883					 **pagan shrines . . . of Samaria:** Josiah’s religious purge extended throughout the former northern kingdom (see also *2 Chr 34:6-7*). Josiah’s freedom to carry out such reforms testifies to his strength and Assyria’s growing weakness (see *study note on 2 Kgs 23:29*).\n\n
23:21	idm46892					 Hezekiah had observed the **Passover** with modifications (*2 Chr 30:1-4*, *13*, *23-27*). Josiah’s **Passover** was done in accordance with the strict standards of the law (*2 Chr 35:1-19*). • **The eighteenth year** was the same year in which the Book of the Law was found (*2 Kgs 22:3*, *8*).\n\n
23:24	idm46907					 Josiah’s commitment to the law brought reforms throughout **Jerusalem** and **Judah**. His attempts to eradicate **every other kind of detestable practice** and his strict observance of the Passover made Josiah greatest among the kings in **obeying all the laws of Moses**.\n\n
23:26	idm46917					 **I will also banish Judah:** Despite Josiah’s strong reforms, **Manasseh***’*s wickedness had become so deeply entrenched among the people that not even Josiah could change their apostate hearts, and the penalties for violation of God’s covenant would be applied (*Deut 28:15-68*).\n\n
23:28	idm46927					 The closing details of Josiah’s reign include a historical notice of his death at the hands of **Pharaoh Neco** (see also *2 Chr 35:20-25*).\n\n
23:29	idm46935					 In 609 BC, **Pharaoh Neco** was en route **to the Euphrates River to help the king of Assyria** in fighting the Babylonians at Haran, when Josiah **met** him **at Megiddo**. After the death of Assyrian king Ashurbanipal in 626 BC, Assyrian cities began falling to Nabopolassar (626–605 BC), king of the rising neo-Babylonian power. Nabopolassar captured Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, in 612 BC. The Assyrian forces fled to Haran, where the Babylonians defeated them in 609 BC. Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon (605–562 BC) later defeated the remaining Assyrians at Carchemish in 605 BC, the same year in which he first invaded Judah (see *24:1*).\n\n
23:30	idm46953					 The Chronicler reports on the great honor that Josiah received in death (*2 Chr 35:24-25*).\n\n
23:31	idm46960					 **Jehoahaz** was named Shallum at birth (see *study note on 1 Chr 3:15*); his throne name **Jehoahaz** has been discovered among seals from the 600s BC. He was **twenty-three years old,** but his brother Jehoiakim was twenty-five (*2 Kgs 23:36*). There is no indication as to why the younger brother was made king. • The **three months** of Jehoahaz’s reign (in 609 BC) might coincide with the period in which **Pharaoh Neco** was attempting to aid the Assyrians (*23:29*).\n\n
23:32	idm46976					 **He did what was evil in the** Lord**’s sight:** The entrenched wickedness and apostasy of the times surfaced even in Josiah’s own sons (*23:32*, *37*; *24:9*, *19*). The Lord’s intention to judge Judah (*23:26-27*) was justified and would soon be fulfilled.\n\n
23:33	idm46990					 **Riblah** was a fortified administrative center in Aramean territory about sixty miles northeast of Damascus.\n\n
23:34	idm46997					 **Eliakim . . . Jehoiakim:** Neco continued the Assyrian practice of requiring an oath of loyalty and assigning a new name to the local head of state.\n\n
23:36	idm47004					 **Jehoiakim***,* Jehoahaz’s older brother (cp. *23:31*), reigned **eleven years** (609–598 BC).\n\n
23:37	idm47015					 **did what was evil:** The record in the book of Jeremiah characterizes Jehoiakim as a total apostate (see *Jer 22:13-23*; *25:1-14*; *26:20-23*; *36:1-32*).\n\n
24:1	idm47026					 Nebuchadnezzar II invaded Judah on at least three occasions (605, 597, 586 BC) and took plunder from Jerusalem and captives to Babylon (see *24:1*, *10-17*; *25:1-21*).\n\n
24:1	idm47036					 In 605 BC, **Nebuchadnezzar** commanded forces that defeated the remaining Assyrian army and an Egyptian contingent at Carchemish (see *Jer 46:2*). While he campaigned in the west, his father, Nabopolassar, died, and Nebuchadnezzar returned home to assume the throne as Nebuchadnezzar II (605–562 BC). When he rejoined his troops, they easily moved down the Mediterranean coast. Sometime during this campaign, he **invaded the land of Judah** and took much plunder and many captives to Babylon, including Daniel and his three friends (*Dan 1:1-7*). **Jehoiakim** was made a vassal to Nebuchadnezzar and **paid him tribute for three years**. When Pharaoh Neco defeated the Babylonians at the Egyptian border in 601 BC, Jehoiakim **rebelled***,* seizing the opportunity to gain his independence.\n\n
24:2	idm47053					 Nebuchadnezzar bided his time between 601 and 598 BC while consolidating his hold on the west, sending various **raiders** to harass **Judah**.\n\n
24:3	idm47062					 **because of the** Lord**’s command:** The root of Judah’s problems was its incorrigible spiritual infidelity. Despite Josiah’s reforms, the **sins of Manasseh** permeated Judah so that divine judgment was inevitable.\n\n
24:4	idm47072					 **innocent blood:** Tradition holds that Manasseh murdered the prophet Isaiah by sawing him in two (cp. *Heb 11:37*).\n\n
24:6	idm47080					 **Jehoiakim died** in 598 BC, evidently during Nebuchadnezzar’s second campaign against Jerusalem (Josephus reports that Nebuchadnezzar executed Jehoiakim; see Josephus, *Antiquities* 10.6.3; cp. *Jer 22:18-19*; *36:30-31*).\n\n
24:7	idm47091					 **The king of Egypt did not venture out of his country after that** because of Nebuchadnezzar’s overwhelming strength. Any hope Judah had of help from Egypt was in vain (see *Jer 2:36*; *46:2-12*; *Ezek 29:6*, *16*). • **The Brook of Egypt** has been identified as either the Wadi el-Arish at the edge of the Nile delta, or as Nahal Besor, which lies south of Gaza.\n\n
24:8	idm47103					 **Jehoiachin** became king in 597 BC. • **he reigned in Jerusalem three months:** cp. *Jer 22:28-30*.\n\n
24:10	idm47113					 Faced with the overwhelming forces of **Nebuchadnezzar,** Jehoiachin **surrendered**. See *study note on 2 Chr 36:9-10*. • The **eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign** was 597 BC.\n\n
24:13	idm47124					 **As the** Lord** had said beforehand:** See *20:16-17*. A greater divine judgment still lay in the future (*21:12-15*; *22:15-20*; *23:26-27*). • **all the treasures:** In his earlier siege of Jerusalem in 605 BC, Nebuchadnezzar had taken part of the Temple treasures as spoil (*2 Chr 36:7*; *Dan 1:2*). He now **carried away all the treasures.** Anything left behind on this occasion was taken in his final siege of Jerusalem in 586 BC (*2 Kgs 25:15*).\n\n
24:14	idm47144					 In addition to **Jehoiachin***,* the prophet Ezekiel was also taken into captivity (*Ezek 1:1*). Throughout the book of Ezekiel, events in Ezekiel’s life are dated in terms of the years since Jehoiachin had been taken captive. • The **10,000** taken captive by Nebuchadnezzar likely includes **7,000 . . . troops, 1,000 craftsmen and artisans***,* and a number of administrative officials and leading citizens of Jerusalem. In any case, *10,000* is probably a round figure (see also *Jer 52:28*).\n\n
24:17	idm47158					 Like the three kings before him, **Mattaniah** received a throne name, **Zedekiah**. • **Jehoiachin’s uncle:** See *1 Chr 3:15-16*.\n\n
24:18	idm47168					 Zedekiah’s reign of **eleven years** in Jerusalem (597–586 BC) mirrored Jehoiakim’s **evil** reign (*23:36-37*). The Lord was judging Jerusalem and Judah for their sins (see *17:19*; *20:16-17*; *21:12-15*; *22:15-20*; *23:26-27*). • **Zedekiah rebelled:** Zedekiah’s rebellion may coincide with an anti-Babylonian alliance spearheaded by Pharaoh Apries of Egypt. When Apries became king of Egypt in about 589 BC, he cherished hopes of recovering Egypt’s past glory. Zedekiah appears to have placed his confidence in him (cp. *Ezek 17:15-18*). Nevertheless, like earlier kings (*2 Kgs 17:4*; *24:1-3*), Zedekiah learned that Egypt would be of little help (cp. *18:20-21*; *Jer 37:3-10*; *Ezek 29:6-7*).\n\n
25:1	idm47191					 **Siege ramps** were characteristic of ancient Near Eastern warfare. Attackers built tall earthen *ramps* and towers to give them a more advantageous position (see *Jer 52:14*; *Ezek 21:22*).\n\n
25:4	idm47201					 Using battering rams (*Ezek 4:2*), **the Babylonians** broke down a section of Jerusalem’s **wall** and penetrated the city. At **nightfall***,* King Zedekiah and the remaining troops **escaped through the gate** at the southeastern corner of the city into the Kidron Valley, attempting to reach the **Jordan Valley**.\n\n
25:6	idm47214					 **Riblah***,* formerly an Assyrian administrative center, served as Nebuchadnezzar’s battle headquarters, as it had for the Egyptians (*23:33*).\n\n
25:7	idm47223					 **gouged out Zedekiah’s eyes:** Rebellious leaders were commonly blinded in the ancient Near East. However, Zedekiah’s blinding seems especially cruel; the last image he had was of his **sons** being **slaughtered**. • True to the prophetic word, Zedekiah was taken into captivity, where he died (*Jer 32:4-5*; *34:3*; *52:11*; *Ezek 12:11-14*).\n\n
25:8	idm47236					 **Nebuzaradan** is known from one of Nebuchadnezzar’s inscriptions as an important **official**.\n\n
25:9	idm47244					 **destroyed all the important buildings:** The Babylonians destroyed key religious and civic buildings to discourage further resistance or insurrection, and they demolished the city’s **walls**, leaving Jerusalem defenseless.\n\n
25:11	idm47252					 The Babylonians took the majority of the population into exile, even some who willingly defected (*Jer 39:9*; *52:15*). • Because **the poorest people** were unlikely to cause trouble, they were left behind to work the **vineyards and fields**.\n\n
25:13	idm47262					 The Babylonians **broke up** the Temple furnishings that had been crafted by Huram of Tyre and **all the other bronze articles** (see *1 Kgs 7:13-50*) for their own use. The transport of these valuable furnishings to Babylon was a major undertaking; everything of value was carried away (see also *Jer 52:17-23*).\n\n
25:17	idm47272					 **7½ feet** is 5 cubits, a reading taken from parallel texts (see NLT note). The Hebrew text reads *3 cubits* (4.5 feet), which might reflect the height of the decorative work adorning the upper part of the **capital** (cp. *1 Kgs 7:17-18*).\n\n
25:18	idm47282					 Instead of deporting key citizens and officials as in the Babylonian invasion of 597 BC (*24:14*), Nebuchadnezzar had these leaders put to death. Even religious leaders were executed. • Although **Seraiah the high priest** was slain, his son Jehozadak was sent into exile (*1 Chr 6:15*). Thus the priestly line continued even in captivity and later returned to Jerusalem beginning in 538 BC (*Ezra 1:1–2:20*).\n\n
25:21	idm47294					 **So the people of Judah were sent into exile from their land:** Like the northern kingdom before it (*17:5-17*), Judah was exiled as punishment for their covenant infidelity. A remnant later returned to the Promised Land in 538 BC (*2 Chr 36:22-23*; *Ezra 1:1–2:20*; see also *2 Chr 36:15-21*; *Jer 25:11*; *29:10*; *Dan 9:2*).\n\n
25:22	idm47309					 Two short appendices describe subsequent events. The first (*25:22-26*) details the area’s reorganization; the second (*25:27-30*) tells of the later kind treatment accorded King Jehoiachin.\n\n
25:22	idm47317					 **Gedaliah**’s father **Ahikam** and grandfather **Shaphan** had been trusted officials during Josiah’s reign (*22:3*, *12*). Ahikam had supported Jeremiah during the reign of Jehoiakim (*Jer 26:24*).\n\n
25:23	idm47329					 Because **Gedaliah** came from a family experienced in civic affairs, his governorship was initially well accepted (see also *Jer 40:1-12*). A seal impression recovered from Lachish confirms Gedaliah’s importance as the officer “over the house” (see *study note on 1 Kgs 4:6*). • In addition to **the army commanders***,* the prophet Jeremiah also went to **Mizpah** to support Gedaliah (*Jer 40:6*). This *Mizpah* was a border town in Benjamin; it had been prominent in Israelite history as a place of religious assembly (*1 Sam 7:5-6*). • The men listed here held important posts. **Ishmael** was from a prominent family of royal lineage (*2 Kgs 25:25*; *Jer 36:12*). **Johanan** served Gedaliah faithfully (*Jer 40:13-16*). The name **Jezaniah** occurs on materials recovered from excavations at Tell-en-Nasbeh.\n\n
25:25	idm47350					 **Gedaliah** had been warned that **Ishmael** was plotting to assassinate him but was unconvinced (*Jer 40:13-16*); his trust cost him his life. Ishmael **also killed** many **Judeans and Babylonians***,* fled with many captives, and escaped to Ammon (*Jer 41:4-15*).\n\n
25:26	idm47363					 **Then all the people of Judah***,* led by Johanan, **fled in panic to Egypt** against Jeremiah’s counsel (see *Jer 42:1–43:7*).\n\n
25:27	idm47373					 **Evil-merodach** (Babylonian, *Amel-marduk*, “man of Marduk”) succeeded Nebuchadnezzar II at his death and reigned a short time (561–560 BC). • **He was kind to Jehoiachin:** Babylonian annals give details of the rations Jehoiachin received in prison. The narrator’s mention of Jehoiachin living in gracious circumstances is perhaps intended to provide hope that God would preserve and restore a repentant people to their land (see *1 Kgs 8:46-53*; *Isa 35:8-10*; *51:11*; *Jer 29:10-14*; *Zeph 3:20*).\n\n
