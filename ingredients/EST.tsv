1:1	idm54673					 The name **Xerxes** comes from the Greek transliteration of the Persian *Xshayarshan,* which the Hebrew text renders *’akhashwerosh* (*Ahasuerus*). His father, Darius I (521–486 BC), was king when Haggai and Zechariah encouraged the people of Judah to finish building the Temple in Jerusalem (see *Ezra 4:24–6:22*; *Hag 1:1*; *Zech 1:1*). • **127 provinces:** Xerxes reigned over a vast empire **stretching from India to Ethiopia.**\n\n
1:2	idm54689					 **The fortress of Susa** was the king’s winter capital during the cold months.\n\n
1:4	idm54696					 **The celebration lasted 180 days:** Officials probably took turns attending different events planned during this six-month period of **celebration***,* thus maintaining the nation’s military and infrastructure throughout the celebration. • This **tremendous display** of **pomp and splendor** was designed to impress others with the king’s greatness; it also illustrates Xerxes’ pride.\n\n
1:5	idm54707					 A second, briefer **banquet** allowed members of every level of society (**from the greatest to the least**) to experience the king’s majestic wealth. Because of the large numbers of people who could attend, this continuous open-house reception was held outdoors in the paved **courtyard of the palace garden**.\n\n
1:6	idm54716					 **White** and **blue** (or *violet*) were royal colors. Even the **mosaic pavement** was exquisitely opulent.\n\n
1:8	idm54726					 **no limits were placed on the drinking:** Often guests would drink only when the Persian king bade them with a toast (see Xenophon, *Cyropaedia* 8.8.18); at this banquet people were able to drink without restraint.\n\n
1:9	idm54734					 Since **Vashti** means *the best, desired, beloved,* this is possibly the title for a favored wife rather than her actual name. Ancient Greek historians refer to her as *Amestris* (e.g., Herodotus, *Histories* 7.114). Her son, Artaxerxes I, became king of Persia (465–424 BC) after Xerxes’ death (see *Ezra 4:7-23*; *6:14*; *7:1*, *7*, *11-26*; *8:1*; *Neh 1:1*; *2:1*; *5:14*; *13:6*).\n\n
1:10	idm54755					 **Xerxes was in high spirits:** He was probably fairly drunk and apt to do something foolish. • **Eunuchs** were servants who had been castrated because their roles brought them into frequent contact with the women of the royal harem.\n\n
1:11	idm54763					 **she was a very beautiful woman:** The king wanted to display one of his prized possessions.\n\n
1:12	idm54770					 **she refused to come:** The queen’s refusal is not explained. Perhaps she feared the drunken king would humiliate her in some way. • **This made the king furious:** The king’s anger was probably heightened by his drunken state and by his humiliation before his male friends.\n\n
1:13	idm54778					 The king did not react immediately but **consulted with his wise advisers***,* following his normal custom of checking with Persian legal advisers to see what could be done about his disobedient wife (*1:15*).\n\n
1:15	idm54787					 **What penalty does the law provide:** In his humiliation, the king no doubt wanted to punish Vashti to the fullest extent.\n\n
1:16	idm54794					 **Queen Vashti has wronged:** The adviser **Memucan** did not quote Persian law as precedent to guide the king’s decision. His impetuous advice to the king turned Vashti’s action into a potential crime by all women.\n\n
1:17	idm54802					 **Women everywhere will begin to despise their husbands:** Fear of consequences rather than facts or law motivated the council’s decision.\n\n
1:19	idm54809					 **issue a written decree . . . that cannot be revoked:** The written decree would become unalterable law that could not be changed (*8:8*; *Dan 6:8*, *12*).\n\n
1:22	idm54819					 The decree was published in each region **in its own script and language** so that the decree would be understood by every language group in the vast Persian Empire. • **every man should be the ruler of his own home:** It was already the cultural norm throughout the ancient Near East at that time that men ruled their houses. The decree added legal enforcement of the custom.\n\n
2:6	idm54827					 **His family** (literally *He*): Since King Jehoiachin was **exiled** in 597 BC (*2 Kgs 24:6-16*), over 100 years earlier, it was probably one of Mordecai’s ancestors who was part of the group taken into Babylonian captivity.\n\n
2:7	idm54838					 **Hadassah** is a Hebrew name that means *myrtle;* **Esther** is a Persian name that means *star.*\n\n
2:9	idm54848					 **ordered a special menu . . . beauty treatments:** Hegai knew the king’s taste and singled out the best prospects for special attention. • Hegai assigned **seven** of the best assistants to Esther, indicating that he thought she was one of the very best candidates for becoming the queen.\n\n
2:10	idm54856					 Mordecai had probably already experienced some prejudice against Jews. Esther’s Jewish background would later become the key to her exposing Haman’s terrible plot.\n\n
2:12	idm54862					 The **twelve months** of preparation no doubt involved training in court customs as well as **beauty treatments***,* but the focus here is on physical beauty.\n\n
2:14	idm54871					 **the second harem:** Each woman would spend one night with the king in his bedroom and then live essentially as a widow the rest of her life unless the king remembered her name and called for her. The women in the second harem lived an easy life in a luxurious setting under **the care of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch**.\n\n
2:15	idm54879					 **Hegai** apparently knew the king’s preferences, so he was able to give Esther good **advice***,* which she wisely **accepted** and followed.\n\n
2:17	idm54889					 **he set the royal crown on her head:** Now Esther had access to the king’s heart as his favored wife. She was now in a place where God could use her to impact the thoughts and actions of the king.\n\n
2:18	idm54896					 **he gave a great banquet in Esther’s honor:** Now the king honored his wife instead of putting her on display (cp. *1:11*). • **declaring a public holiday:** The Hebrew word translated “public holiday” (*hanakhah*) is related to the verb that means “rest” (*nukh*). The book as a whole describes how the Jewish people obtained rest from the threats of their enemies (see *9:16-22*).\n\n
2:19	idm54908					 **Even after all the young women had been transferred to the second harem:** Since the queen had been chosen, those in waiting would join the other concubines. • **Mordecai had become a palace official** (literally *Mordecai was sitting in the gate of the king*): Court cases were decided and much official business was conducted at the gate. There Mordecai was able to hear about the plot against the king (*2:21-23*).\n\n
2:20	idm54918					 **keep her family background and nationality a secret:** That this is mentioned twice (see also *2:10*) indicates how important it was for the rest of the story. • With humility, **she was still following Mordecai’s directions**. She did not become conceited and forget her people or the family that raised her.\n\n
2:21	idm54927					 **Bigthana** might be the Bigtha of *1:10*, one of the king’s seven eunuchs. He and **Teresh** guarded the king’s bedroom, so it would not have been hard for them to carry out their plot if they hadn’t been discovered.\n\n
2:22	idm54936					 **gave the information to Queen Esther:** The quickest, safest way for the information to get to the king was through the queen. • Although Esther could have promoted herself by taking credit for this information, she **gave Mordecai credit for the report***,* an important point later in the story (*6:1-3*).\n\n
2:23	idm54946					 **impaled on a sharpened pole** (literally *hanged on a tree,* or *hanged on wood*): This phrase has traditionally been translated *hanged on a gallows,* but inscriptions from ancient Persia show that impalement was a standard form of execution. Xerxes’ father, Darius I, claimed to have impaled 3,000 Babylonians when he conquered Babylon. Sometimes criminals were executed first and then displayed on a stake, as with the execution of Haman’s sons (*9:5-14*). • **This was all recorded:** Mordecai was not rewarded until much later (*6:1-14*). • While various records of Xerxes’ reign have been found, the particular book mentioned here no longer exists.\n\n
3:1	idm54959					 **Haman***’*s hatred for Mordecai develops into a plot to kill all the Jewish people.\n\n
3:2	idm54967					 It was a common custom to **bow down** before a superior (e.g., *Gen 33:3*). Since Mordecai served at the large gate to the palace and **Haman** entered the king’s court through that gate, there were many opportunities for Mordecai to break the king’s command and not bow before Haman.\n\n
3:6	idm54976					 Haman was not interested in justice; he wanted revenge. He was determined to do everything in his power to crush Mordecai, including exterminating his entire people—the Jews.\n\n
3:7	idm54982					 **lots were cast . . . (the lots were called** purim**)**: Throwing the *purim* was like throwing dice. The Hebrews used lots from time to time to understand God’s will (*Lev 16:8-10*; *Neh 10:34*). Persian astrologers used *purim* in the first month of the year to determine which days that year would bring good fortune.\n\n
3:8	idm54995					 **who keep themselves separate: **Jews intermarried within tight-knit communities and resisted integration into the larger culture. • **Their laws are different:** They had a unique set of laws (eating and religious customs) and were to be separate from the sinful customs of the people around them (*Lev 14:42-45*; *15:31*; *19:2*, *26-37*). • **they refuse to obey the laws of the king:** This accusation, which is false in general, probably refers to Mordecai’s refusal to bow to Haman. • **So it is not in the king’s interest to let them live:** Haman played on the king’s fears and interests as Memucan had done in *Esth 1:16*. Intolerance toward any particular group of people ran against the general Persian tendency to be respectful of other people’s cultural and religious differences.\n\n
3:9	idm55010					 Haman tipped his hand by offering to bribe the king with a large sum of **silver***,* which should have made the king suspicious of Haman’s motives. The value of the proposed gift is so astronomical that Haman may have been exaggerating to show his intended generosity.\n\n
3:10	idm55018					 **The king agreed** with no inquiry. The king is presented as someone very irresponsible and easily manipulated. By **removing his signet ring***,* the king gave up his control over official policies; by **giving it to Haman***,* he signified that Haman had complete authority to seal the decree. • **the enemy of the Jews:** The narrator’s new title for Haman is an ominous note regarding his power to persecute the Jews (see also *8:1*; *9:10*, *24*). • **The money and the people are both yours:** It may appear that the king did not want the bribe, but *4:7* suggests that Haman did give the money. The king was following a customary protocol to make the bribe and his greed less obvious (cp. *Gen 23:10-16*). For the sake of public appearance the king pretended not to be interested in the money, but in reality he was.\n\n
3:12	idm55036					 **So on April 17:** Haman’s choice of the day before the Jewish Passover began (see *Exod 12:6*) was probably calculated to terrorize and demoralize the Jews. But as he did at the Exodus, God would deliver the Jews miraculously from a tyrant who was trying to destroy them.\n\n
3:13	idm55044					 The phrase **killed, slaughtered, and annihilated** is repeated with ironic effect in *8:11* and *9:5*. • **on March 7 of the next year:** Haman’s “lucky day” that was chosen by casting lots (*3:7*) was eleven months after the decree, by God’s providence, giving time to overcome the decree. • **The property of the Jews would be given to those who killed them:** Haman ingeniously bribed the would-be executioners.\n\n
3:14	idm55056					 **This decree** carried the full weight of Xerxes’ royal authority. • The foolish **king** and wicked **Haman** celebrated this occasion, but the people of **the fortress of Susa** were perplexed, bewildered, and confused at such a ruthless and unjust decree.\n\n
4:1	idm55066					 Mordecai’s dramatic response showed extreme grief and mourning (see *2 Sam 1:11*; *Ezra 9*; *Jon 3:5-9*).\n\n
4:2	idm55075					 **no one was allowed:** The king did not want to hear all the sorry stories of misfortune and people pleading for mercy.\n\n
4:3	idm55082					 **great mourning among the Jews:** In these reports of lamenting, God’s name is not mentioned, but the lamenting and fasting implies crying out in prayer for God to intervene and save his people (*Exod 2:23-25*; *Ezra 9:5-15*; *Dan 9:1-19*).\n\n
4:8	idm55092					 **A copy of the decree** with the king’s seal would prove to Esther the seriousness of the situation. • **to beg for mercy:** Mordecai gave Esther no reasons to present to the king, only an appeal to the king’s mercy and Esther’s influence on him on behalf of her own people.\n\n
4:11	idm55100					 **anyone who appears . . . without being invited is doomed to die:** Access to the king was strictly controlled by his guards to prevent unwanted guests from wasting the king’s time with petty requests. Since these were the official rules of the court, the danger to Esther’s life was enormous. Apparently she ruled out requesting an audience with the king through a messenger, possibly because she would have to tell the messenger why she wanted to talk to the king. • **has not called for me to come to him for thirty days:** Esther had no guarantee of the king’s favorable response.\n\n
4:13	idm55108					 **Don’t think . . . you will escape:** Mordecai did not back down and did not excuse her because of the danger, and he reminded her that it would be more dangerous for her to say nothing to the king. • **deliverance and relief for the Jews will arise from some other place:** Mordecai knew God’s promises and realized that God would not allow his chosen people to be annihilated (see *Gen 12:3*; *22:18*; *28:14*; *Isa 60:1-5*). • **perhaps you were made queen for just such a time as this:** Esther’s rise to power at this precise time was not just a lucky chance of fate—her position as Xerxes’ favored wife and queen was a role that God had given her to influence history for the Jewish people.\n\n
4:16	idm55121					 **fast for me:** Esther was convinced, but she wanted as many Jews as possible to pray that God would intervene to save her life. • **Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day:** A total **fast** without any food or water often lasted only one day (*Lev 16:29-31*; *Judg 20:26*). The three-day length was consistent with the seriousness of the situation and the absolute need for God’s intervention. • **though it is against the law, I will go in to see the king:** In spite of the danger, she determined that she must act for the sake of her people. • **If I must die, I must die:** She, like Mordecai, was a person of character who would do what was right in spite of personal danger.\n\n
5:2	idm55134					 **he welcomed her and held out the gold scepter to her:** She was not killed for entering the king’s presence without an invitation (*4:11*, *16*).\n\n
5:3	idm55143					 **I will give it to you, even if it is half the kingdom!** This conventional idiom meant the king would be generous toward her request. The king did not want anything to prevent Esther from speaking the full truth.\n\n
5:4	idm55150					 **If it please the king:** Esther showed proper deference (cp. *1:12*).\n\n
5:8	idm55158					 **please come . . . tomorrow:** It was a customary protocol not to appear anxious about asking for a favor or negotiating an agreement. The delay provided opportunity for Xerxes to discover Mordecai’s act of loyalty, which led to the foiling of Haman’s plot (see *6:1-14*).\n\n
5:9	idm55166					 This brief interlude emphasizes the depth of Haman’s hatred for Mordecai.\n\n
5:9	idm55172					 **Mordecai***’*s fasting had ended and he was back at the **gate** operating in his official capacity. **Not standing up or trembling** was an even stronger refusal to show Haman honor (cp. *3:2-6*).\n\n
5:14	idm55183					 **A sharpened pole** was a common device of execution (see also *2:23*; *Gen 40:19*, *22*; *Josh 8:29*). • **Seventy-five feet** is unusually high, but Haman wanted to make an example out of Mordecai, with everyone viewing his dead body. The number might be a hyperbole for effect—*fifty cubits* is an obviously round number—or it might reflect a stake placed high atop the city wall for public viewing.\n\n
6:1	idm55196					 **the king had trouble sleeping:** God was working to protect Esther and Mordecai. • **the book of the history of his reign:** Ancient kings kept royal annals of their reigns.\n\n
6:2	idm55204					 Providentially, the king’s servant happened to open the royal annals to the page describing **how Mordecai had exposed the plot** (*2:21-23*).\n\n
6:3	idm55212					 **What reward or recognition did we ever give Mordecai?** The Persian kings were known for generosity to their supporters, so the king was probably surprised that **nothing** had **been done**.\n\n
6:4	idm55221					 Just as the king was pondering what to do to honor Mordecai, **Haman** arrived to seek Mordecai’s death. With great irony, the narrator recounts the king’s consulting with him about how to reward Mordecai.\n\n
6:7	idm55228					 Haman delighted in public acclaim and recognition. He wanted to be honored as the king, to wear kingly attire, and to ride the king’s horse; in other words, he wanted to be king for a day. • Haman thought another **one of the king’s most noble officials** would honor him through the streets of Susa. Instead, Haman himself would fill that role for Mordecai (*6:10*).\n\n
6:10	idm55236					 **do just as you have said for Mordecai the Jew:** With utter shock at this complete reversal, Haman could do nothing but obey the king’s command, right down to the last detail.\n\n
6:13	idm55243					 **Since Mordecai—this man who has humiliated you—is of Jewish birth, you will never succeed in your plans:** Haman’s wife and friends could see that this was more than just a series of coincidences. The text does not explain why Zeresh and the advisers felt that the fact of Mordecai’s Jewish heritage would necessarily mean that Haman’s plans would not succeed.\n\n
7:3	idm55250					 **my life and the lives of my people:** The statement that someone wanted to kill the queen and her family must have surprised and shocked the king. • **my people and I have been sold:** Esther carefully referred to the huge price Haman had paid the king to approve the decree (*3:8-11*). She also used the exact terminology of Haman’s decree when she said that its purpose was to **kill, slaughter, and annihilate** (cp. *3:13*). • **If we had merely been sold as slaves, I could remain quiet:** Esther humbly justifies her request as due to the severity of the attack on her and her people.\n\n
7:5	idm55262					 **Who would do such a thing?** The king could hardly believe what he was hearing and could not imagine someone trying to do this atrocious thing. He asks for no details about Esther’s accusations, assuming they were all true (cp. *3:10*).\n\n
7:6	idm55270					 **Esther** finally identified **this wicked Haman** as the **enemy**. • **Haman grew pale with fright:** With this surprising and aggressive accusation by the queen and the evident **rage** of the king, Haman’s doom suddenly became apparent.\n\n
7:8	idm55281					 **he fell on the couch where Queen Esther was reclining:** A major mistake, for no one should touch the queen, much less be on the same couch with her. • **Will he even assault the queen . . . before my very eyes?** This exaggerated rhetorical question implicates Haman with the worst possible motives.\n\n
7:9	idm55289					 **He intended to use it to impale Mordecai:** Harbona, one of the king’s seven eunuchs (*1:10*), was apparently no friend of Haman and was already aware of Haman’s plot. • **impale Haman on it!** This great reversal of fortunes demonstrates the guiding hand of God. Regarding impalement, see *study note on 2:23*.\n\n
8:1	idm55299					 Just as Haman had promised the wealth of the Jews to those who would kill them (*3:13*), **Xerxes gave the property of Haman, the enemy of the Jews, to Queen Esther.**\n\n
8:2	idm55307					 The **signet ring** that Haman had used to seal the decree to destroy the Jewish people (*3:10*) was now given to the Jewish person he had most wanted to destroy.\n\n
8:3	idm55315					 **Esther** probably expected the king to reverse Haman’s decree right after he was killed, but that did not happen. This time she was much more insistent on raising the issue of Haman’s plot against her people.\n\n
8:5	idm55322					 Esther was asking for the unusual favor of reversing a law signed with the king’s seal. • **the orders of Haman:** Esther diplomatically avoided suggesting any responsibility on the king’s part.\n\n
8:8	idm55329					 According to Persian law, **whatever has already been written . . . can never be revoked** (see *1:19*; *Dan 6:8*, *12*; cp. *Ps 148:6*). However, a new decree with the king’s royal seal could give different or competing directions.\n\n
8:9	idm55340					 **on June 25:** The details of writing and sending the new decree purposely match the account of sending out the original decree in *3:12*.\n\n
8:11	idm55348					 **The king’s decree** did not permit the Jewish people to start a war but to defend themselves and plunder the property of those who attacked them (reversing the decree in *3:13*). • The phrase **kill, slaughter, and annihilate** is an ironic repetition of the words in Haman’s original edict (*3:13*; see also *9:5*).\n\n
8:12	idm55359					 **March 7 of the next year:** This date was nearly a year after Haman’s original decree was published (*3:12*).\n\n
8:13	idm55367					 The Hebrew word translated **to take revenge** could also mean *to establish justice.* In situations where civil government could not exercise authority over all the parties involved in a conflict, this law would allow people who were attacked to establish justice by redressing wrongs committed against them.\n\n
8:15	idm55375					 Just as the city of **Susa** had been in great confusion after Haman’s original decree (*3:15*), now there was great rejoicing by all—they understood the injustice of the original decree and the justice of the new one.\n\n
8:17	idm55383					 **many . . . became Jews themselves:** That is, they became proselytes of Judaism.\n\n
9:1	idm55390					 **on March 7:** When that fateful day arrived, there were many **enemies of the Jews** who wanted to carry out Haman’s wishes.\n\n
9:3	idm55398					 People saw that **Mordecai** was the man in charge, so they knew it would not be wise to oppose him.\n\n
9:5	idm55405					 **They killed and annihilated their enemies:** It was not an attack on defenseless people or a ruthless uncontrolled killing spree, but a victorious self-defense against their attackers. The phrase used here repeats the terminology of Haman’s original decree (*3:12*).\n\n
9:6	idm55413					 Although most people **in the fortress of Susa itself** supported Mordecai, **the Jews killed 500 men***,* a mini-revolt that probably consisted of killing Haman’s relatives and close supporters.\n\n
9:7	idm55422					 **They also killed . . . the ten sons of Haman:** Now everything that Haman had boasted about (*5:11*) was gone, even his ten sons.\n\n
9:10	idm55430					 **But they did not take any plunder:** Although taking plunder from those who attacked was permitted (*8:11*), the Jews did not want anything to do with the defiled wealth of Haman’s sons. Many years earlier, Abram had refused his portion of the plunder from the king of Sodom (*Gen 14:21-23*).\n\n
9:12	idm55439					 If the king had been disturbed by the high numbers, he would not have allowed another day of fighting (*9:14-15*). It seems more likely that the king was astonished that there were so many people who followed Haman and opposed the new regime directed by Mordecai. He was thinking of the political stability of the empire.\n\n
9:13	idm55446					 Possibly Esther knew that some of the people in Susa who had attacked Jews on the first day had gotten away and would be planning additional attacks to avenge the death of Haman.\n\n
9:14	idm55452					 **So the king agreed, and the decree was announced in Susa:** It was not in the king’s interest for there to be warring parties within the palace plotting to kill one another.\n\n
9:15	idm55459					 Once **again***,* the Jews took the high moral ground and **took no plunder** from their enemies, though it was legally permitted (*8:11*; *9:10*).\n\n
9:16	idm55470					 **75,000** seems like quite a large number. The Old Greek translation has 15,000 and the Targum has 10,107 men. The Hebrew word translated *thousands* can also indicate an extended family or lineage, so it is possible that 75 *extended families* were killed.\n\n
9:17	idm55479					 **they rested, celebrating their victory with a day of feasting and gladness:** God is not mentioned, but surely they thanked God on this day for their rescue. This was the beginning of a new festival, later called Purim (*9:19-32*).\n\n
9:19	idm55487					 The **annual festival and holiday** of Purim celebrates God’s blessing of peace from their enemies (see *Deut 25:19*; *Josh 21:44*; *1 Sam 7:11-14*). The narrator reports that the festival was celebrated **to this day**. Now, more than 2,400 years later, it is still celebrated annually by Jewish people. • The exchange of **gifts of food** demonstrated the unity of the people and their care for one another and helped them to spread an atmosphere of joy for everyone celebrating the festival.\n\n
9:23	idm55499					 These verses summarize the events leading to the Festival of Purim.\n\n
9:26	idm55505					 This paragraph justifies **Purim** as an approved Jewish **festival** even though Moses did not authorize it along with other festival days.\n\n
9:29	idm55513					 The **letter** that **Queen Esther . . . wrote** provided further official endorsement to Mordecai’s proposal (*9:20-23*).\n\n
10:1	idm55522					 **King Xerxes imposed a tribute:** Persian taxes on the provinces were heavy. This burden supported the Persian government’s free spending.\n\n
10:2	idm55529					 **The Book of the History of the Kings of Media and Persia** was the Persian royal annals. While many ancient Persian records have survived, this reference to **the greatness of Mordecai** has not been found in any records excavated thus far.\n\n
10:3	idm55537					 **Mordecai the Jew** did not brag about himself as Haman did (*5:11-12*), but this righteous man who continually looked out for the good of others was rewarded with a high government position (**prime minister**) and the high esteem of his people (**He was very great among the Jews**).\n\n
