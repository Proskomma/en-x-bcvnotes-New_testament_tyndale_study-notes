1:1	idm28147					 Two prologues (*1:1–2:5* and *2:6–3:6*) preface the body of the book. Both begin with **the death of Joshua** (*1:1*; cp. *2:8*), thus connecting Judges with the preceding narrative (*Josh 24:29-33*; cp. *Josh 1:1*; *2 Sam 1:1*).\n\n
1:1	idm28161					 The first prologue describes the unfaithfulness of the tribes in their failure to carry out Joshua’s farewell charge (*Josh 23*).\n\n
1:1	idm28168					 The request for divine guidance (see *Exod 28:30*; *Num 27:21*; *1 Sam 14:41*; *28:6*; cp. *Josh 7:14*) is a reminder that the Lord’s covenant with Israel included the taking of the land.\n\n
1:2	idm28179					 This verse, which is paralleled in the epilogues (*20:18*), shows the primacy of **Judah**. This tribe did not figure in the downward cycles of the judges (cp. *15:9-13*) after Othniel, the model judge who was linked to Judah through Caleb (*Josh 14:6*; *15:13*, *17*).\n\n
1:3	idm28191					 **The tribe of Simeon** virtually disappeared within the land assigned to Judah (*Josh 19:1*). • **fight against the Canaanites . . . help you conquer:** See *Josh 16:10*; *17:13*; *23:4-13*.\n\n
1:10	idm28203					 **Hebron** was the city nearest to Abraham’s dwelling by the oaks of Mamre (*Gen 13:18*); the patriarchs later lived and were buried there (*Gen 23:19*; *35:27*; *49:29-32*). It was originally called **Kiriath-arba** (“City of Arba”), after the legendary Arba, who was “a great hero of the descendants of Anak” and “Anak’s ancestor” (*Josh 14:15*; *15:13*). The Anakites, in turn, are identified with the dreaded Nephilites (*Num 13:33*; see *Gen 6:4*).\n\n
1:11	idm28219					 **Debir** or **Kiriath-sepher** (“City of the Book”): This major Anakite town of the hill country (*Josh 11:21*) is not firmly identified but is traditionally understood as being either southwest or east of Hebron.\n\n
1:14	idm28228					 **she urged him:** See *study note on Josh 15:18-19*.\n\n
1:16	idm28236					 The **Kenites** were a southern desert tribe associated with **Moses’** in-laws, who were also called Midianites (*Exod 18:1*; *Num 10:29*). Moses offered them a share in the covenant blessing (*Num 10:29-32*). At least one clan of Kenites accepted the offer and was adopted into Judah, though members of the clan later shifted allegiance to King Jabin of Hazor (*Judg 4:11*, *17*).\n\n
1:17	idm28249					 **completely destroyed:** See *Lev 27:28-29*. • **Hormah:** See *study note on Num 21:2-3*.\n\n
1:18	idm28259					 **Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron**, with Gath and Ashdod, later made up the five main cities of the Philistines (*3:3*).\n\n
1:19	idm28267					 Despite the Lord’s presence, the conquest was not completed because of **iron chariots** and lack of obedience (see *Josh 23:12-13*; *24:14*).\n\n
1:21	idm28276					 The tribes of Israel failed to keep the covenant; their complacency was rebellion against the Lord, as the rest of the book of Judges shows.\n\n
1:21	idm28282					 Though **the tribe of Benjamin** produced more than its share of heroes (e.g., Ehud, Saul), it was also the nadir of covenant unfaithfulness, in contrast to Judah (see *20:18*). Like Judah in its first battle (*1:4-8*), Benjamin faced challenges from a great people dwelling in a great city, but Benjamin settled for sharing the city with them. Reference to the Lord’s personal presence is absent (cp. *1:19*, *22*). The Jebusite city remained in Canaanite hands until David’s day. • The phrase **to this day** highlights either ongoing historical circumstances (here and *6:24*) or the survival of certain customs to a later time (*1:26*; *10:4*; *15:19*; *18:12*).\n\n
1:22	idm28299					 Two references to the descendants of Joseph (*1:22*, *35*) frame this litany of the northern tribes’ failures to drive out the enemy.\n\n
1:22	idm28307					 **The** Lord** was with** the descendants of Joseph (the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh), but only in their united attack on Bethel, a place sacred to Israelite memories from the days of Jacob (*Gen 28:19*). They failed in attacks made separately (*Judg 1:27-29*). • **Bethel** is associated with the battle against Ai (*Josh 7:2*) and is listed in the summary statement of kings that Israel had defeated (*Josh 12:16*).\n\n
1:24	idm28321					 To **have mercy** (Hebrew *khesed*) has the overtones of making a covenant (see also *8:35*, “loyalty”).\n\n
1:26	idm28330					 **The land of the Hittites** was probably a general name for North Syria, not the Hittite Kingdom of Anatolia (now Turkey). Nothing is known of the new **Luz**.\n\n
1:27	idm28338					 This chain of Canaanite cities stretched from **Dor** on the Mediterranean to **Beth-shan** in the Jordan Valley and effectively cut off the northern tribes from those south of the Jezreel Valley. Likewise, a number of the cities listed in the south (*1:35*) probably cut Judah off from the northern tribes.\n\n
1:34	idm28347					 Dan’s failure to take the land represents total infidelity and led to the complete abandonment of a portion of the Promised Land (chs *17–18*).\n\n
2:1	idm28354					 The sanctuary had been set up at Gilgal (*Josh 4:19-20*; *5:10*); **Bokim** is an unknown place, where **the angel of the** Lord gave an announcement that led to **weeping** and an attempt to reverse the judgment by offering sacrifice.\n\n
2:1	idm28366					 Even when Israel was unfaithful, God’s **covenant**, originally given to Abraham, remained unconditional (*Gen 12:1-3*; *17:1-22*; cp. *2 Tim 2:13*).\n\n
2:2	idm28376					 The gods of the nations were not a neutral force, so destroying the pagan **altars** was basic to covenant obedience. Not doing so would inevitably involve social and religious compromise, and the people of the land would oppress Israel (see *Deut 20:17-18*).\n\n
2:6	idm28384					 The second prologue also follows from the events of *Josh 23–24* (see *study note on Judg 1:1–3:6*), adding the element of a third generation (*2:10*) who had no personal experience of the Lord’s mighty acts.\n\n
2:8	idm28393					 Cp. *1:1*; *Josh 24:29-31*.\n\n
2:10	idm28401					 Joshua was dead, the new generation had not experienced God’s saving power, and the Canaanites continued to live in the land. What resulted was the cycle of rebellion and partial restoration. This section introduces that cycle, which the body of the book exemplifies.\n\n
2:11	idm28407					 Israel rebelled against the Lord and began serving the gods of their neighbors, especially the Canaanite deities Baal and Asherah. • **Baal** means “lord”; **Ashtoreth** might be a Hebrew form of the Canaanite “Astarte,” a goddess with various manifestations. See also *6:25-32* and *study notes*.\n\n
2:14	idm28417					 As Israel served other gods, God withdrew his support. Their rebellion brought **great distress** from military defeat by their enemies.\n\n
2:15	idm28424					 God was not simply absent; he was actively involved in Israel’s defeat, and the outcome of the battle belonged to the Lord (cp. *2 Chr 20:15*).\n\n
2:16	idm28431					 **The** Lord** raised up judges** whose leadership brought partial, temporary restoration. They were later described as “judging” Israel (e.g., *3:10*; *4:4*; *10:2-3*), but they were primarily known for their military victories.\n\n
2:20	idm28443					 The remaining Canaanites and their religion would become a source of temptation to the Israelites, offering an alternative to faithfully following the Lord and his covenant ways. This result was known and even planned by God (cp. *3:4*), but God does not deliberately set his people up to sin (*Jas 1:12-15*). Temptations abound, but the choice to obey God or yield to temptation rests with those who claim to know him. Israel had a duty to possess the land fully, but God, not humankind, determines victory or failure.\n\n
3:1	idm28451					 The ongoing presence of **the Philistines** and **Canaanites** in the land had an instructional purpose. Skills in warfare were necessary for survival in the ancient world. God allowed a continuing presence of enemies, but they would become his provision for Israel’s training and well-being.\n\n
3:3	idm28459					 **The Philistines** were never listed with the native Canaanite tribes; they were invaders from the sea who settled on the southwest coast of Israel in about 1200 BC. The Philistines were organized into five cities, each with its own ruler (cp. *1 Sam 6:16-17*). They are included here with the **Canaanites**, anticipating the prominent role they would have as Israel’s major foe from Samson’s time onward. • The text includes **Sidonians** and northern **Hivites** to show that Israel’s ideal boundaries were well to the north and east of what they actually possessed. • The **Hivites** were Canaanite (Hamitic) peoples (*Gen 10:17*); little is known about them. The Gibeonites, who tricked Joshua (*Josh 9:3-27*) were Hivites. • **Baal-hermon** is possibly the largest of the three peaks that make up Mount Hermon in the northeast corner of Israel; **Lebo-hamath**, in southern Lebanon, marks Israel’s northernmost ideal boundary (*1 Kgs 8:65*).\n\n
3:5	idm28477					 Israel failed God’s test (*3:1-4*). Intermarriage led Israel to worship in the fertility cult of the Canaanite **gods**.\n\n
3:7	idm28485					 The account of Othniel is typical of the cycles in Judges. Evildoing led to apostasy, most frequently in the **Baal** and **Asherah** cults (see study notes on *2:11-13*; *6:25-32*). Apostasy provoked the Lord and resulted in foreign oppression. Then the cry of the people evoked divine compassion and the raising up of a rescuer-judge as the agent of God’s Spirit. The rescuer ended the oppression, and the land enjoyed a period of peace before the cycle started again. **Othniel** depicts an ideal judge.\n\n
3:8	idm28496					 **Cushan-rishathaim** means “Cushan of Double Wickedness.” • **Aram-naharaim** means “Aram of the Two Rivers”; it is thought either to refer to the region between the Euphrates and Balih Rivers in Mesopotamia or to be equivalent to Mesopotamia (a word that means “Midst of the Two Rivers,” the region between the Tigris and the Euphrates).\n\n
3:12	idm28504					 In this epic account of intrigue and cunning, Ehud manifested heroic qualities when a coalition of nations from east of the Jordan penetrated the hill country of Ephraim and Benjamin. The cycle follows formulaic language and highlights the repeated apostasy of the people** once again**.\n\n
3:12	idm28511					 The people of **Moab** and the **Ammonites** were descendants of Lot’s incestuous relationship with his daughters (*Gen 19:30-38*). Despite their kinship with Israel, both nations were Israel’s enemies. • The **Amalekites** were nomads who had attacked Israel in the desert, and toward whom unbroken hostility had been commanded (*Num 24:20*; *Deut 25:17-19*). That the three nations joined in coalition probably reflected their growing fear of Israelite expansion.\n\n
3:15	idm28523					 **left-handed** (literally *restricted in the right hand*): This characteristic enabled **Ehud** to hide his weapon on the right hip. The Greek Old Testament translates this phrase to mean “ambidextrous.” The term used here is associated with the tribe of Benjamin (“son of my right hand,” *Gen 35:18*; see *Judg 20:16*) and was connected with heroic military skills (cp. *1 Chr 12:1-2*). • The **tribute money** was either pieces of metal or, more likely, agricultural goods requiring a team of bearers (*Judg 3:18*).\n\n
3:16	idm28537					 A knife for cutting would have a single blade. This **doubled-edged dagger** was fashioned to facilitate driving it into a victim.\n\n
3:19	idm28544					 The **message** had to be **secret** to ensure that Ehud would be left alone with the king; it had to be **from God** to guarantee that the ploy would be effective. Eglon probably stood up because he expected some kind of message from the Lord, which is precisely what he received.\n\n
3:19	idm28553					 **Gilgal** became the Israelites’ initial base of operations after they crossed the Jordan and was the site of important events associated with the conquest (*Josh 4–6*). The **stone idols** may have been a pagan shrine created from the twelve stones that Joshua set up (*Josh 4:20*). Later, Gilgal was still an important center for the faithful (*1 Sam 7:16*) and for idolators (*Hos 4:15*; *9:15*; *12:11*; *Amos 4:4*; *5:5*).\n\n
3:20	idm28569					 The **cool upstairs room** was probably some kind of rooftop chamber, a common summer meeting place in hot countries.\n\n
3:23	idm28576					 **and escaped down the latrine:** The latrine might have been similar to those in medieval Europe, where it was not uncommon for a latrine to extend out from the wall of a building, with an external chute not unlike today’s laundry or chimney ash chutes.\n\n
3:24	idm28583					 While the king’s servants, perhaps reacting to familiar odors, dithered over protocol for a king with bowel problems, Ehud made his escape.\n\n
3:26	idm28589					 **Seirah** is unknown, but it was accessible to the hill country, from which Ephraim and Benjamin could be rallied.\n\n
3:27	idm28596					 **sounded a call to arms** (literally *blew a trumpet*): The trumpet blast and the call **“Follow me”** were accompanied by the assurance of divine victory through the God-appointed rescuer.\n\n
3:31	idm28605					 **Shamgar** is nowhere specifically identified as an Israelite or as a judge (see *5:6-7*). • **son of Anath:** Anath was perhaps a Canaanite goddess or shrine (cp. *1:33*, “Beth-anath”); from similar references in ancient literature, some have seen him as part of a Canaanite warrior class.\n\n
4:1	idm28615					 The account of **Deborah** and **Barak**, given in both prose (ch *4*) and poetry (ch *5*), is the only large-scale military operation recorded against a major Canaanite foe after the initial conquest. Another king named **Jabin**, who also ruled in the city of **Hazor**, was defeated in an earlier battle against Joshua along with a vast northern coalition, and Hazor was burned (see *Josh 11:1-15*). Although *Joshua 11* and *Judges 4–5* have often been compared, there are too many differing details to consider them to be parallel records of the same battle. Instead, Jabin is probably a dynastic name; the name occurs in the Mari texts for an even earlier king of Hazor, around 1800 BC.\n\n
4:1	idm28631					 The opening of ch *4* provides chronological continuity with **Ehud** and reinforces the cyclical nature of Israel’s experience during this period.\n\n
4:2	idm28639					 **Hazor***,* located north of the Sea of Galilee, dominated the intersection of major trade routes running north–south and east–west. References to Hazor appear frequently in ancient Near Eastern documents, and the site has been extensively excavated. Its position as a one-time “capital of all [those] kingdoms” (*Josh 11:10*) is confirmed by history and archaeology. • **Harosheth-haggoyim** (“Forest/Farmland of the Nations”) was possibly a staging area for the battle; its location and history are debated.\n\n
4:3	idm28649					 Contemporary records confirm that armies like Sisera’s had large numbers of **iron chariots**. Such a force would have expected overwhelming victory over the lightly-armed Israelite infantry.\n\n
4:4	idm28656					 Deborah was **a prophet** (Hebrew *’ishah nebi’ah**,* “a woman, a female prophet”) **who was judging** (*shoptah*, a feminine verb; see *study note on 2:16-19*). She is the protagonist of this story, though much of the action surrounds her surrogate, Barak. Unlike most of the characters in the book of Judges, Deborah fulfilled both the judicial and the military functions implied by the label “judge.” As a prophet, she foreshadowed Samuel’s later work (*1 Sam 7:15-17*). Deborah called for a holy war in which the Lord would fight for his people (*Judg 4:6-7*; see study notes on *Deut 1:30*; *2 Chr 20:20-21*).\n\n
4:6	idm28672					 Though **Barak** appears in a list of Israelite heroes (*Heb 11:32*), Judges never gives him more than an equal place with Deborah. • **Mount Tabor** was in the territory of Issachar, just north of the Jezreel Valley.\n\n
4:7	idm28681					 The **Kishon River**, which runs northwest into the Mediterranean just north of Mount Carmel, formed the Jezreel Valley.\n\n
4:8	idm28688					 The theme of the reluctant rescuer surfaces again with Gideon (*6:15*; cp. *Exod 3:11*).\n\n
4:9	idm28696					 **Honor** for the **victory** would go to **a woman**, which meant a loss of face for Barak. • This **Kedesh** appears to have been near Mount Tabor (cp. *4:6*, *12*), a different location than the Kedesh in Naphtali (*4:6*), which would have been too far north for the action described.\n\n
4:10	idm28709					 The warriors came from Barak’s tribe of **Naphtali** and its southern neighbor, **Zebulun**.\n\n
4:11	idm28717					 Kenites related to Moses’ father-in-law had settled in Judah (*1:16*), in the southern desert (*Exod 2:16-22*) near the Amalekites in the mountainous country near Moab (*Num 24:21-22*). Part of the tribe had apparently migrated north and settled near the Sea of Galilee.\n\n
4:12	idm28726					 Upon hearing of Barak’s muster of troops, **Sisera** fell into the trap set by the Lord. He headed for the Jezreel Valley with his **chariots**, marching along the **Kishon River** where wheeled vehicles could operate freely.\n\n
4:14	idm28735					 **Mount Tabor**, with its forest cover, was a strategic location, and the rush down the hill must have surprised the unsuspecting Canaanites. The battle was won, however, because it was the Lord’s war, not because of human strategy and tactics. • Nothing is said here about why the **chariots** were so ineffective; this awaits the poetic version of the account (*5:21*).\n\n
4:17	idm28744					 **Sisera** felt that he was back in **friendly** circles (cp. *4:11*). A woman whose husband was absent would normally invite a man into her tent only for sex, but Sisera would have interpreted this invitation as an opportunity for safe haven. **Jael** did nothing to shake his confidence as she concealed and refreshed him.\n\n
4:19	idm28754					 The **milk** was probably the curds so favored by the Arabs (cp. “yogurt,” *5:25*); many believe that it is soporific.\n\n
4:21	idm28762					 **Jael** completed what seems to have been her intention all along. There is a more graphic description of the event in *5:26-27*.\n\n
4:23	idm28770					 **God** defeated **Jabin** by orchestrating people and events.\n\n
4:24	idm28778					 Sisera’s army was gone, but **Jabin** and his kingdom were subdued more gradually.\n\n
5:1	idm28785					 **This song***,* a victory hymn usually credited to **Deborah***,* presents a second, more poetic account of the entire battle with various details that supplement the prose account. It is one of the most ancient Hebrew poems. It blesses the Lord, those tribes who responded to the muster, and Jael. It curses those who remained at home, Sisera, and his mother’s entourage. It contrasts conditions before Barak’s victory, when the Lord’s curse was on the land, with the life of blessing in the wake of the warriors’ righteous acts. It ends with a prayer that the Lord’s enemies will perish like Sisera (*5:31*).\n\n
5:3	idm28796					 The victory song is primarily a hymn to **the** Lord**, the God of Israel**. It is also a wisdom song that gives instruction to **kings** and **rulers***,* as other wisdom psalms do (see “*Wisdom Psalms*” Theme Note).\n\n
5:4	idm28809					 In the poem, the Lord is on the march from his home in the mountains of Edom (cp. *Hab 3:3*), or **Mount Sinai** (one tradition places Sinai east of the Jordan Valley, in the region of Edom; cp. *Gal 4:25*). The fire and earthquake that had so terrified Israel at the giving of the law (*Exod 19:18*) here symbolize God’s power and fury on the battlefield against his enemies. • Torrential **rain** would have created a quagmire, making Sisera’s chariots a liability rather than an asset (*Judg 4:15-16*).\n\n
5:6	idm28822					 During this period of chaos and uncertainty, there was little security for those living outside the main walled cities. Even **Shamgar** (see *3:31*) did little to alleviate the misery of the common people, who suffered under the hand of the Canaanites and their cruel commander, Sisera.\n\n
5:7	idm28830					 **Deborah** was God’s agent in bringing relief during this general social breakdown. Deborah did not muster or command the troops, but she was Israel’s spiritual and emotional pillar; she is described as **a mother** in Israel.\n\n
5:8	idm28838					 **Israel** was in social chaos and also lacked defensive weapons. • **Forty thousand warriors:** The Hebrew word translated *thousand* could also be translated *clans* (see *study note on Exod 12:37*).\n\n
5:10	idm28849					 Both the rich (those **who ride**) and the poor (those **who walk**) were to listen and spread the song, which would have both a spiritual and a social impact as it was disseminated.\n\n
5:11	idm28857					 **Listen to the village musicians:** The picture is of divine exploits being recited where people gathered. Much Old Testament narrative and psalmody probably took shape in this way. “Remembering” in song and poetry is foundational to both Jewish and Christian worship.\n\n
5:13	idm28864					 **The few** were Barak’s army, marching **down** against the **mighty warriors** of Sisera’s army.\n\n
5:14	idm28873					 These verses honor those who volunteered and shame those who did not. • **Ephraim, Benjamin**, and Manasseh (represented by **Makir**) came from the south. **Issachar**, the territory where the battle actually took place, was joined by **Zebulun** and **Naphtali**, the two tribes closest to Barak’s home base. • The tribes that were too irresolute and fainthearted to join the fight included **Reuben**, Gad (represented by **Gilead**), **Dan**, and **Asher**.\n\n
5:19	idm28888					 The battle is described. The brave warriors who followed Deborah and Barak faded into the background as the Lord mustered **the stars** of **heaven** and **the Kishon River** to obliterate Sisera’s host.\n\n
5:19	idm28897					 **Taanach** was southeast of the great administrative center of Megiddo, so the battle took place in the lower part of the Jezreel Valley. The references to Taanach and Megiddo are probably poetic allusions to well-known places in the Jezreel Valley, rather than exact locations of any fighting, which appears to have taken place between Mount Tabor and the lowlands around the Kishon River.\n\n
5:23	idm28904					 The location of **Meroz** is unknown, but it should not be confused with Merom (*Josh 11:5*), which was approximately twenty miles to the north in the hills of Galilee.\n\n
5:24	idm28912					 Sisera’s end is described in a brief celebration of **Jael**.\n\n
5:28	idm28919					 The natural confidence of **Sisera’s mother** was beginning to crumble.\n\n
5:29	idm28926					 The **wise women** betrayed Sisera’s evil intentions as they tried to encourage his mother. • The poet didn’t need to tell how the story concluded.\n\n
5:31	idm28933					 **Sisera** typifies the Lord’s **enemies***;* Jael represents those who **love** the Lord. • **there was peace in the land:** Rest followed the Lord’s rescue.\n\n
7:1	idm28944					 Gideon’s judgeship brings to a close the first period of judges.\n\n
6:1	idm28950					 After forty years of peace, religious syncretism had brought about political instability, and marauding nomads had reduced **the Israelites** to living as fugitives. • **The Midianites** were once thought to be a purely nomadic tribe centered in northwest Arabia, but they are now understood to have built cities and for a time to have dominated much of the Arabian Peninsula and southern Transjordan (the area east of the Jordan). They are joined here by Amalekites (who earlier were part of a Moabite coalition; see *study note on 3:12-13*) and the mysterious **people of the east** (cp. *1 Kgs 4:30*; *Ezek 25:4*, *10*). The pattern of attack was seasonal but devastating.\n\n
6:5	idm28963					 **Camels**, known in some contexts from as early as 3000 BC, are frequently associated with eastern nomads and their raids. This may be one of the first recorded instances of camels being used in a large military force.\n\n
6:8	idm28971					 This unnamed **prophet** and Deborah are the only prophets to appear in Judges. This prophet rebuked Israel’s apostasy in language familiar from Deuteronomy onward.\n\n
6:11	idm28978					 Gideon encountered **the angel of the** Lord and emerged as a hero. He overthrew the syncretistic Baal cult of his family and town and called his people to fight in the Lord’s name.\n\n
6:12	idm28986					 **Mighty hero** translates a Hebrew term that is elsewhere translated as “strong warriors” (*Josh 6:2*), pointing to Gideon’s potential military heroism, and as “the rich” (*2 Kgs 15:20*), pointing to his social standing as a member of a leading family. • **the** Lord** is with you:** A commission to fight God’s war is usually accompanied by assurance of his presence (see *Deut 1:30*; *Josh 1:1-9*).\n\n
6:13	idm29000					 Like others called to be prophets or judges, **Gideon** was reluctant to obey. He questioned God’s presence and his own adequacy (see *study note on 4:8*; *Exod 3:1–4:17*; *Jer 1:4-19*).\n\n
6:15	idm29010					 Gideon’s personal and clan status was itself insufficient to muster troops.\n\n
6:22	idm29016					 Encounters with divine holiness are inherently dangerous (cp. *Gen 32:30*; *Deut 5:4-5*).\n\n
6:24	idm29024					 The symbolically named **altar** commemorates the divine presence and favor. By the time the account was written down (**to this day**), the altar had probably become a pilgrimage site.\n\n
6:25	idm29032					 In a provocative act that was commanded by God, Gideon destroyed and desecrated a community altar to Baal and its Asherah pole.\n\n
6:25	idm29038					 In Canaanite worship, **Baal** was a storm and fertility god, while **Asherah** was often represented as a sacred tree.\n\n
6:31	idm29046					 The first person to follow Gideon’s inspired act of leadership and abandon Baal for the Lord was Gideon’s father **Joash**, who was, ironically, the keeper of the Baal shrine.\n\n
6:33	idm29053					 The nomadic coalition (*6:1-6*) set up camp at the eastern end of the **valley of Jezreel***,* which divided Israel’s central tribes from the Galilean hills.\n\n
6:34	idm29062					 As is typical of the inspired leaders in Judges, the Spirit **clothed Gideon with power**. A similar metaphor is frequent in Paul’s letters (e.g., *Rom 13:12*; *Gal 3:27*; *Eph 4:24*; *6:11*; *Col 3:10*, *12*, *14*).\n\n
6:36	idm29076					 The **fleece** incident was not a confirmation of God’s intention to use Gideon (which had already been established, *6:17-24*), but God’s indulgence in responding to the reluctant hero’s uncertainty.\n\n
7:1	idm29084					 The **spring of Harod** and **the hill of Moreh** were just east of the town of Jezreel; they guarded the pass that connects the valley of Jezreel to the fords of the Jordan near Beth-shan. Gideon’s army was located on the north slope of Mount Gilboa. The Midianite hosts were in the valley below, with the hill behind them.\n\n
7:2	idm29092					 **The** Lord does not require a large force to save his people (cp. *1 Sam 14:6*). A large number might even have hindered success because the element of surprise was crucial to the Lord’s battle plan. **Gideon** was to pare down the army to maintain godly humility, not for reasons of military strategy.\n\n
7:3	idm29102					 The first reduction sorted out those who initially responded with enthusiasm but then had second thoughts.\n\n
7:4	idm29108					 The choice of those who lapped from their hands over those who knelt was apparently arbitrary, but it enabled the Lord to reduce the size of the army.\n\n
7:8	idm29114					 The jars (in which the men carried **provisions**) and trumpets borrowed from the warriors who were sent home would be used in the coming battle.\n\n
7:10	idm29121					 The Lord **encouraged** Gideon with a third sign (*6:17-21*, *36-40*).\n\n
7:11	idm29130					 With the **enemy camp** spread out across the valley (*7:1*, *12*), it was easy for Gideon and his servant to sneak undetected into the camp.\n\n
7:13	idm29139					 Dreams and their interpretations were often discussed in Egypt and Babylonia. The Old Testament teaches that dreams are inspired by God and are best interpreted by his revelation (see *Gen 41:15-16*, *25*; *Dan 2:28*). The point of this dream is clear: Gideon’s band, represented as a rounded **loaf of barley bread**, would come **tumbling down** and overturn **the Midianite camp**.\n\n
7:16	idm29151					 Dividing the small band **into three groups** created the impression of a much larger force.\n\n
7:17	idm29158					 Surprise and deception took the place of a massive army. The war cry, the sudden blast of 300 trumpets, and the torches bursting into light created the impression of a large force.\n\n
7:21	idm29164					 The warriors **stood** in place while God fought the battle (cp. *Exod 14:13*; *1 Sam 12:16*; *Rev 19:11-16*). • The Midianites’ camels (*Judg 6:5*) might have contributed to the **panic**. Camels usually provided a military advantage, but in this situation they would have been a liability. They had probably been hobbled for the night, and camels themselves are subject to panic.\n\n
7:22	idm29176					 The fugitives fled in a southeasterly direction, past Beth-shan and toward the fords of the Jordan, trying to reach more friendly and favorable surroundings.\n\n
7:24	idm29182					 The **shallow crossings of the Jordan** were key to cutting off the escape of an army (cp. *3:28*; *12:4-6*).\n\n
7:25	idm29191					 **Oreb** (“raven”) and **Zeeb** (“wolf”) were military leaders, in contrast to Zebah and Zalmunna, who were kings (*8:5*). This capture was commemorated in the subsequent names of the rock and winepress where they were captured.\n\n
8:1	idm29200					 **Ephraim**, the dominant tribe of the north-central hill country, produced only a minor judge, Tola (*10:1*). The Ephraimites resented their omission from the battle, if only because they hoped for a share of the spoils. When summoned, they did the job at hand. **Gideon** gave a gracious and humble answer, which turned away Ephraim’s **anger** (see *Prov 15:1*; contrast Jephthah, *Judg 12:1-4*). Gideon’s and Ephraim’s victories over **Oreb and Zeeb** and their armies became the stuff of legend (cp. *Ps 83:11-12*; *Isa 10:26*).\n\n
8:4	idm29215					 At this point, **Gideon** seemed as bent on revenge as on victory, and there is an abrupt cessation of his earlier dialogue with the Lord. The core of **300 men** made this final run against the Midianites. • Gideon pursued the fleeing **kings of Midian** through the Jabbok gorge, then southward toward Rabbah, following **the caravan route** onto the Transjordan plateau. • **Succoth** and **Peniel** were Israelite cities, but their loyalty to Gideon, an upstart general, was thin. The tribes east of the Jordan were continually exposed to the Midianites’ pressure and apparently feared the Midianites.\n\n
8:7	idm29227					 It was a common practice in the ancient Near East to **tear** the **flesh** of a defeated foe (cp. *Amos 1:3*; *Mic 4:13*).\n\n
8:8	idm29237					 **this tower:** Towers were common in the period and have been excavated at both Succoth and Shechem (see *9:46-49*).\n\n
8:10	idm29245					 Apparently the **Midianite** remnant with its **two kings** felt reasonably secure, having reached the Transjordan plateau en route to their traditional desert haunts. This put them well beyond typically Israelite territory. As he had done before (*7:19-22*), **Gideon** took **the Midianite army by surprise**. He **captured** the two kings and routed the army, thus eliminating the threat of Midianite retribution feared by the leaders of Succoth and Peniel.\n\n
8:13	idm29257					 The return journey was probably a straight course (through the unknown **Heres Pass**) rather than the circular approach needed for the ambush. • That a typical **young man from Succoth** could **write down the names** is evidence that the newly developed alphabetic writing system had taken root in Israel. • Gideon’s practice of retribution and execution was the norm in his time, though Gideon’s reputation as the Lord’s servant was better served by his skillful diplomacy (*8:1-3*) than by vindictive punishment.\n\n
8:18	idm29267					 It is not clear just when the slaughter **at Tabor** took place; it may have occurred during the earlier battle.\n\n
8:20	idm29274					 Matters of honor dominated this interaction. Death at the hand of a woman or a child was considered dishonorable (*5:24-27*; *9:54*).\n\n
8:21	idm29282					 **royal ornaments** (or “crescent necklaces,” *Isa 3:18*): Desert nomads tended to carry their wealth with them; jewelry maximized value for weight.\n\n
8:24	idm29290					 **Ishmaelites** and Midianites were both descendants of Abraham (*Gen 16:15*; *25:2*).\n\n
8:27	idm29299					 An **ephod** was normally considered part of the priestly garments (*Exod 28:6-30*); one was also worn by Samuel and David (*1 Sam 2:18*; *2 Sam 6:14*; *1 Chr 15:27*). But here, as in *Judg 17:5* and *18:14-18*, the *ephod* appears to have been some kind of **gold** image, which in turn became an object of idolatrous worship.\n\n
8:28	idm29314					 When **there was peace in the land** (see *study note on 3:7-11*) before Abimelech, it was for multiples of twenty years (*3:11*, *30*; *5:31*). After Gideon, the lengths were shorter. Israel’s ongoing apostasy led to increased social instability (cp. chs *17–21*).\n\n
8:29	idm29326					 Advanced age is generally a sign of divine blessing, but Gideon was tarnished by a decline of spiritual blessing and leadership.\n\n
8:31	idm29332					 **concubine:** See *study note on 19:1*.\n\n
8:33	idm29340					 Gideon’s ephod (*8:27*) quickly became part of a pagan shrine honoring **images of** the ever-present Canaanite deity **Baal**, here called **Baal-berith** (“Baal of the covenant”). Fundamental to this apostasy were the twin themes of forgetting the Lord and his works and disloyalty to godly leadership. Remembering is basic to biblical, covenantal worship, from the time of the Exodus (*Exod 12:14*, *24*) to the ongoing Christian celebration of the Lord’s Supper (*1 Cor 11:25*). • **loyalty:** See *study note on Judg 1:24*.\n\n
9:1	idm29355					 The reign of Abimelech was the turning point between the comparative rest of the early period of judges (*3:7–8:35*) and the decline of the later years (*10:1–16:31*).\n\n
9:1	idm29363					 **Abimelech**, son of a concubine (*8:31*; see *study note on 19:1*), now argued that he could fulfill Israel’s desire for the kind of royal dynasty rejected by his father. • The lack of any account of a conquest of Shechem, despite Israel’s covenant activities in the city (*Josh 24*), suggests that Shechem’s inhabitants were assimilated into Israel. Abimelech’s **uncles** and his mother might thus have been of non-Israelite heritage.\n\n
9:3	idm29374					 Abimelech’s appeal raised funding from the local **temple of Baal-berith**, the worship center for a mixed Canaanite-Israelite religious cult.\n\n
9:4	idm29381					 True leaders do not buy loyalty and they appeal to the noble in society, not to **reckless troublemakers** like Abimelech’s mercenary followers.\n\n
9:5	idm29388					 The murder of the **seventy . . . sons of Gideon . . . on one stone** was probably some kind of ritual slaying. • **youngest brother . . . escaped:** Cp. *2 Kgs 11:1-3*.\n\n
9:6	idm29397					 **Beth-millo** (“house of filling”) was probably an elevated terrace on which an inner keep or tower was built (cp. *2 Sam 5:9*; *1 Kgs 9:15*, *24*). The irony is thick: Abimelech—empty of divine appointment, priestly anointing, and popular acclaim—met at the “house of filling.” His kingship was a sham.\n\n
9:7	idm29407					 **Jotham** told a fable (a story in which plants and animals take on human attributes to make a moral point) to show what was happening (*9:7-15*). He then cursed **Abimelech** and **the leading citizens of Shechem** (*9:16-21*). If they had acted in bad faith, it would become evident (*9:56-57*).\n\n
9:7	idm29419					 **Mount Gerizim** was the mountain of blessing opposite Mount Ebal, the mountain of cursing (*Deut 11:29*). Gerizim, situated immediately south of Shechem, was a natural stage for Jotham’s speech and also allowed him to escape when he was finished.\n\n
9:8	idm29427					 Olives, figs, and grapes were fundamental to the agriculture of Canaan, yielding important produce and adding to the beauty of the landscape. • To **wave back and forth over the trees** implied being visible and active while accomplishing nothing.\n\n
9:14	idm29434					 The trees, preferring an evil king to none at all (cp. *1 Sam 8:18-19*), called on the **thornbush**, who, though neither useful nor pleasing to the eye, accepted the job. The person who had agreed to be king did not have more profitable work to do. • **Shade** from the burning Middle Eastern sun was precisely what the thornbush could not produce. Accepting such an offer was both futile and foolish.\n\n
9:16	idm29443					 The people of Shechem had chosen to follow an unworthy man; they had also acted in bad faith by conspiring with Abimelech against Gideon’s family.\n\n
9:19	idm29449					 The Shechemites were invited to decide whether their actions merited blessing or cursing. The implication was that they had acted in bad faith, so they and Abimelech would destroy each other. The Lord is a devouring fire (*Heb 12:29*), and those who act unfaithfully prove his justice.\n\n
9:22	idm29456					 Theological statements in *9:23-24* and *9:56-57* frame the account of the civil strife that led to the destruction of Abimelech and Shechem, which was divine fulfillment of the curse set out by Jotham (*9:19-20*).\n\n
9:22	idm29465					 As prophesied in the fable (*9:8-15*), **Abimelech** was unable to live up to the Shechemites’ expectations, so they conspired against him.\n\n
9:22	idm29473					 It took **three years** to bring about what God had decreed. The **spirit that stirred up trouble** found willing hearts. Those condemned for their folly participated fully in their own demise; they brought it on themselves.\n\n
9:25	idm29481					 An informer foiled the **plot** against Abimelech, but social conditions were deteriorating as God’s curse played out.\n\n
9:26	idm29488					 **Gaal son of Ebed** (“vile son of a slave”) led an unsuccessful rebellion against Abimelech in which many of Shechem’s citizens were killed. This partially fulfilled Jotham’s curse (*9:20*).\n\n
9:27	idm29496					 Disillusionment with Abimelech, social unrest, and lots of **wine** and loose talk made it easy for **Gaal** to gain initial acceptance.\n\n
9:28	idm29504					 **Who is Abimelech? . . . He’s not a true son of Shechem:** Gaal focused on Abimelech’s pedigree through his father, Gideon (a non-Shechemite), rather than through his mother (*8:31*; *9:2*). • **Serve the true sons of Hamor:** Gaal’s pedigree apparently went back to Hamor, **the founder of Shechem** (*Gen 33:18–34:31*).\n\n
9:30	idm29516					 The second plot, like the first (*9:22-25*), was foiled by an informer, in this case probably an official appointed by the absent Abimelech. **Zebul** proposed a bold **morning** ambush, in which he would presumably help to draw **Gaal** and his followers out into the open country where they could be engaged. The plan worked. Perhaps because of his boasting and possibly in response to Zebul’s mocking challenge, Gaal and his men ventured out only to be driven from town by the faithful Zebul, the agent for cleansing the city.\n\n
9:42	idm29526					 The NLT supplies the words **to battle***,* with the understanding that the Shechemites **went out into the fields** to keep Abimelech from reasserting power over them. Others think that the Shechemites returned to the fields to continue the harvest (*9:27*), believing that Abimelech would be satisfied now that Gaal had been driven out.\n\n
9:43	idm29536					 Abimelech forfeited any claim he might have had to being an inspired leader; he turned **his men** on **the people** of Shechem, slaughtered them all, and destroyed the city.\n\n
9:45	idm29544					 Scattering **salt** prevented anything from growing and ensured destruction.\n\n
9:46	idm29551					 The **leading citizens** (literally *lords*) of **Shechem** who had first plotted against Abimelech now crowded into **the temple of Baal-berith** only to have it burn around them. This destruction has been confirmed by archaeologists at the site.\n\n
9:48	idm29561					 **Mount Zalmon** is probably another name for Mount Ebal, the mountain opposite Gerizim and next to Shechem.\n\n
9:50	idm29568					 **Thebez** was a stronghold a few miles northeast of Shechem. Abimelech was probably reclaiming Thebez, but he might have been attempting an initial takeover.\n\n
9:53	idm29575					 Women frequently ground grain on a stationary lower millstone, on which the lighter upper **millstone** was turned by hand. This incident is referenced in the story of David’s murder of Uriah (*2 Sam 11:21*).\n\n
9:54	idm29583					 To die at the hands of **a woman** or a child was shameful (see *study note on 8:20-21*). Abimelech was not given a peace formula or burial notice, because his reign was not legitimate.\n\n
9:56	idm29591					 The theological summary returns to the theme of Jotham’s fable (*9:24*). Abimelech had no divine charisma, and his death as a result of divine vengeance meant that justice was finally served for Gideon’s family. Israel’s experiment with uninspired kingship was a stark example of leadership that was not from God.\n\n
10:1	idm29598					 Each of the five minor judges (see also *12:8-15*) **judged Israel** for a specific number of years; in this period of decline after Gideon, the formula “there was peace in the land” (*3:11*, *30*; *5:31*; *8:28*) never recurs. The details given for these enigmatic figures include their places of origin and burial, and perhaps a brief genealogy or something notable about their families. Four of the five names appear in other genealogical records: Tola and Puah as clans of Issachar (*Gen 46:13*; *Num 26:23*), Elon as a descendant of Zebulun (*Gen 46:14*; *Num 26:26*), and Jair at various points (see *Num 32:41*; *Deut 3:14*; *Josh 13:30*; *1 Kgs 4:13*). The lack of specific military exploits and the common reference to “judging” suggests that they had some kind of administrative or judicial function.\n\n
10:1	idm29618					 **Tola** was the first of five minor judges; little is known about him. Of the five, only Tola was said **to rescue Israel**. He came **after Abimelech died**, when Israel was in need of rescue, though not from a foreign enemy.\n\n
10:3	idm29627					 **Jair** was apparently a descendant of an earlier Jair of the tribe of Manasseh (see *Num 32:41*; *Deut 3:14*; cp. *1 Kgs 4:13*). The **Towns of Jair** that Jair and his sons controlled had been conquered by the earlier Jair.\n\n
10:6	idm29638					 The Lord responded to his people’s total apostasy by allowing crushing oppression (*10:8*). As usual, Israel **cried out to the** Lord** for help** (*10:10*) only after experiencing **great distress** (*10:9*). Normally, Israel’s cry led to divine intervention, but God’s decision to leave them to their chosen gods marks a shift in the cycle described in *2:10-19*. Only when **the Israelites put aside their foreign gods and served the** Lord did he again act to redeem them (*10:17–11:33*).\n\n
10:6	idm29655					 **Again the Israelites did evil. . . . They abandoned the** Lord**:** This period of apostasy was more complete than any described earlier—it included the worship of **Baal and Ashtoreth** along with other local **gods**.\n\n
10:7	idm29666					 **The Philistines:** See study notes on *3:3*; *13:1*. • **The Ammonites** lived east of the Jordan (see *study note on 3:12-13*), and they began by oppressing the Israelite tribes of Transjordan; then they attacked the tribes west of the Jordan as well.\n\n
10:17	idm29677					 The narrative returns to the Ammonite oppression, which sets the stage for Jephthah’s story.\n\n
10:18	idm29683					 **The leaders of Gilead**, in their desperation for leadership, did not consult the Lord (cp. *1:1*; *20:18*) but said that **whoever** stepped up to lead would **become ruler over** Gilead.\n\n
11:1	idm29694					 In **Jephthah**, inspired leadership took a new turn. He had humble origins, attracted followers, was eloquent in debate, and had Spirit-filled military prowess, but all of these were overshadowed by the fatal flaws of his untimely vow (*11:30-31*, *34-35*) and his petulant civil war with Ephraim (*12:1-6*). Even his victory was short-lived (“six years,” *12:7*). The period of decline was underway, which increased the demand for kingship.\n\n
11:1	idm29705					 **great warrior:** Jephthah had military prowess and possibly social prominence (see *study note on 6:12*, where *great warrior* is translated “mighty hero”). **Gilead** was a descendant of Manasseh (*Num 26:29-33*; *32:39-40*; *1 Chr 7:14-17*). Jephthah’s social standing raised his visibility despite the ignominy of his **prostitute** mother. His **half brothers** had no obligation to accept Jephthah’s status or leadership.\n\n
11:3	idm29720					 Jephthah’s **worthless rebels** are reminiscent of Abimelech’s “reckless troublemakers” (see *9:4*), but Jephthah had no need to buy their loyalty.\n\n
11:4	idm29728					 **Ammonites . . . war:** See *10:17*.\n\n
11:5	idm29736					 These **elders** were apparently distinct from Jephthah’s brothers, although Jephthah’s initial response (*11:7*) appears to equate the two groups. They had promised (*10:18*) that whoever took the military initiative and attacked the Ammonites would become the ruler. Here, in typical Middle Eastern bargaining style, they only offered the status of **commander**, trying to diminish their initial promise.\n\n
11:7	idm29746					 When Jephthah challenged the offer, the elders returned to the stronger word, **ruler**.\n\n
11:9	idm29753					 Jephthah made sure that the elders really were offering him the position of **ruler**, not just “commander.”\n\n
11:11	idm29760					 At the end of the negotiations, Jephthah was sworn in as both **ruler and commander**. • This **Mizpah** (“watchtower”) was a shrine east of the Jordan in Gilead, which was Jephthah’s home (*10:17*; *11:29*, *34*); it should not be confused with Mizpah in Benjamin, the place near Bethel where the tribes later assembled and swore oaths for the final battle of Judges (*20:1*; *21:1*). • The ceremony at Mizpah **in the presence of the** Lord appears to have been the making of a suzerain-vassal covenant, in which a ruler (the suzerain) promises to protect and defend a vassal people in exchange for authority over them (see *study note on Exod 20:1–23:33*; see also *Deuteronomy Book Introduction*, “Literary Form”).\n\n
11:12	idm29777					 Jephthah initially tried to solve the problem by diplomatic rather than military means (cp. *Deut 20:10-11*). • Unlike the nomadic, marauding Midianites of Gideon’s day, the Ammonites were a settled tribe whose territory lay to the east of Israel’s holdings in Transjordan (east of the Jordan); Rabbah was the Ammonite capital. The Ammonites, like the Moabites (both descendants of Lot) and the Edomites (Esau’s descendants), were to be left alone, as their territories were assigned to them by the Lord (*Deut 2:16-23*). • Contrary to the Ammonite king’s contention, the Amorites, not Ammon or Moab, lived between the Arnon and Jabbok rivers at the time of the conquest. In response to Sihon’s refusal to let Israel pass, the Lord had given the land of the Amorite kings Sihon and Og to Israel. The Ammonite king had no legitimate quarrel with Israel.\n\n
11:17	idm29785					 **Kadesh** had been Israel’s base for spying out the land (*Num 32:8*; *Deut 1:19*; *2:14*). The name comes from the Hebrew root *qadesh* (“holy”) and presumably is named for a shrine.\n\n
11:24	idm29796					 **Chemosh** was the god of the related tribe of Moabites. If the land occupied by Israel east of the Jordan originally belonged to Moab (see *study note on 11:25*), the Ammonite king would still have regarded Chemosh as the god of that land. Whether Jephthah regarded Chemosh as a god or was accommodating himself to the king’s belief system is not clear.\n\n
11:25	idm29804					 **Moab** and Ammon were related (descendants of Lot). Moab, as opposed to Ammon, may have had a legitimate claim to the land that Israel occupied north of the Arnon, which was taken from them earlier by Sihon, king of the Amorites (*Num 21:24*). The Israelites had conquered Sihon and annexed the disputed territory, but Moab had not attempted to claim it. Neither should Ammon, because the land in question had never belonged to them.\n\n
11:26	idm29812					 Whether the conquest and settlement took place in the 1400s BC or the 1200s BC (see *Judges Book Introduction*, “Chronology of the Judges Era”), Jephthah’s **300 years** is probably a round figure.\n\n
11:27	idm29822					 Jephthah appealed to **the** Lord*,* the great **judge**, to decide between **Israel** and **Ammon**. The Lord’s response (*11:29-33*) was his answer.\n\n
11:29	idm29835					 **The Spirit of the** Lord, a consistent sign of inspired authority, **came upon Jephthah**, and he journeyed through the tribal lands of **Gilead and Manasseh, including** his hometown of **Mizpah in Gilead,** gathering troops. During this time leading up to battle, he made his infamous **vow**.\n\n
11:31	idm29847					 Nowhere does the Lord demand such bargaining for his favor. Vows were made under a variety of circumstances and usually involved some gift (offering) dedicated to the Lord in response to his aid (cp. *Gen 28:20-22*). The more common preparation for battle was priestly sacrifice (*1 Sam 13:8-12*). Jephthah’s vow created the possibility that some person in his household would become a human sacrifice, an act strictly forbidden in Israelite law (*Deut 18:10*).\n\n
11:32	idm29856					 No connection is drawn between the **victory**, which was the Lord’s gift, and Jephthah’s vow.\n\n
11:35	idm29863					 Having made an impulsive **vow**, Jephthah now compounded his folly by blaming the result on his **daughter** and by failing to respond in light of Scripture. Vows taken were usually inviolable (*Num 30:2*), though the Old Testament recognizes a few circumstances under which an unwise vow could be set aside (*Num 30:6-8*). Since human sacrifice was forbidden in the law, a substitute could have been made (see *Lev 27:1-8*). Jephthah was apparently unaware of these principles in God’s law, perhaps because of his upbringing in an area far from Israel’s major centers.\n\n
11:39	idm29874					 Jephthah **kept the vow** by sacrificing his daughter—there is no evidence that he merely kept her permanently celibate (cp. *11:37*). Jephthah’s folly demonstrates just how far Israel’s society had descended into lawlessness and apostasy.\n\n
12:1	idm29882					 **Ephraim** once again felt neglected (cp. *8:1-3*) and sought revenge. In contrast to Gideon’s policy, Jephthah’s response blamed Ephraim and resulted in civil war.\n\n
12:1	idm29890					 **Zaphon** was just east of the Jordan River, across from the tribal area of Ephraim.\n\n
12:2	idm29897					 There is no record of Jephthah’s earlier appeal.\n\n
12:4	idm29903					 It is unclear why **the people of Ephraim** were taunting the **men of Gilead.** Perhaps they resented or looked down on the Israelites who lived east of the Jordan River.\n\n
12:5	idm29911					 The **Jordan River** could only be forded at **shallow crossings** where tributaries had deposited silt, as was probably the case where the Jabbok flowed into the Jordan.\n\n
12:6	idm29919					 The term **Shibboleth** has come to mean any password used to identify imposters. Such linguistic litmus tests have been used by armies throughout history. • **42,000 Ephraimites:** This number could possibly be translated as “42 troops” (see *study note on Exod 12:37*).\n\n
12:7	idm29928					 **six years:** Like all the judges after Gideon, Jephthah’s years as judge were specific and short (see *study note on 8:28*). Jephthah was **buried** honorably, so despite his limitations he was an inspired and successful warrior (*11:29*; contrast Abimelech, *study note on 9:54-55*).\n\n
12:8	idm29939					 The account continues with these minor judges (see *study note on 10:1-5*).\n\n
12:8	idm29946					 If this was the northern **Bethlehem** located in Zebulun, it can be understood as part of the structure of Judges, in which each of the tribes supplies one of the twelve judges (see *Judges Book Introduction*, “Summary”).\n\n
12:15	idm29954					 The **Amalekites** had earlier occupied parts of **Ephraim** (*5:14*).\n\n
14:1	idm29963					 **Samson**, who receives more attention in the book of Judges than any other judge, is even more of an enigma than Jephthah. Samson reflects a high level of inspiration as a leader. He also personifies the inexorable march toward chaos that highlights the need for a more centralized society under a godly ruler.\n\n
13:1	idm29970					 Though mentioned earlier, **the Philistines** (*3:3*; *10:7*) were a relatively new presence in the territory of Canaan, which would later be named for them (Palestine). This warlike race of sea people were of Greek rather than Canaanite ancestry and settled into the southwestern coastal areas about 1200 BC. From then on, Philistia was Israel’s natural enemy and increasingly threatened its national existence. Israel’s institutions, such as kingship, developed partly in response to the Philistine challenge.\n\n
13:2	idm29980					 Prior to their migration to the extreme north (ch *18*), **the tribe of Dan** attempted to settle in Israel’s southwest (*Josh 19:40-48*). This put them in direct conflict with the incoming Philistines. • **Zorah** was west of Judah, in the area newly occupied by the Philistines. Both Dan and neighboring Judah submitted to Philistine dominance (*Judg 14:4*; *15:11*).\n\n
13:3	idm29992					 **Manoah’s wife** was promised **a son** who was to be set aside from his birth as a **Nazirite** (see *Num 6:1-21*; cp. *1 Sam 1:11*). The requirement that Samson’s **hair must never be cut** would be central to his story.\n\n
13:4	idm30004					 **any forbidden food:** See *Lev 11*.\n\n
13:6	idm30012					 Several times in Scripture, an angel appeared to women who were unable to become pregnant (*13:2*) to announce divine intervention through the birth of a child (see *Luke 1:5-25*; cp. *Gen 18*; *1 Sam 1*).\n\n
13:12	idm30022					 In light of *13:4-5*, Manoah’s question may seem redundant, but from *13:8* it is apparent that **Manoah** felt a keen personal responsibility for raising such a child. The angel responded graciously, but again stressed the wife’s responsibility, which explains why it was she, not Manoah, who was first approached.\n\n
13:15	idm30031					 **Manoah** would only send a visitor on his way after providing a meal, in accord with eastern hospitality. **The angel** insisted that any food be given **as a sacrifice to the** Lord. That and his reluctance to eat (cp. Gideon’s visitor, *6:17-22*) suggest that this was a *theophany* (an appearance of God). To that point, Manoah had failed to recognize his visitor’s divinity.\n\n
13:17	idm30043					 The Lord’s **name** is a divine secret (*Gen 32:29*; *Exod 3:13-14*). God knows our names, but in addressing him we are limited to terms of wonder and adoration, for the true essence of the infinite cannot be expressed or understood by the finite.\n\n
13:19	idm30052					 It is not possible for human beings to take in the full revelation of God’s holy presence and still live (cp. *6:20-24*; *Exod 19:21*; *33:20*). The Old Testament frequently reports divine visitations on earth in human form; these visitations foreshadow the full appearance of God on earth in the incarnation of Jesus.\n\n
13:25	idm30061					 Inspired leaders are filled with the divine **Spirit**. In spite of Samson’s evident failures, the Spirit’s presence was powerfully at work in him. • **Mahaneh-dan** (literally *camp of Dan*) is mentioned again in *18:12*; the phrase could describe a temporary settlement rather than a fixed location. • **Zorah** (*13:2*) and **Eshtaol** were in the valley of Sorek, about fifteen miles west of Jerusalem at the pass that leads down to Philistine territory.\n\n
14:1	idm30074					 Samson’s choice to marry a Philistine woman was the Lord’s means (*14:4*) of beginning to confront the Philistine challenge (see *13:5*). One thing led to another, punctuated by three occasions when the Spirit **came powerfully upon him** (*14:6*, *19*; *15:14*). Throughout these events, Samson was a powerful but flawed hero.\n\n
14:1	idm30086					 **Timnah** was probably about four miles down the valley of Sorek from Mahaneh-dan, at the intersection of the Israelite and Philistine territories.\n\n
14:2	idm30093					 Samson’s choice of a bride was informed only by his pleasure in her appearance. Intermarriage was a significant mark of covenant infidelity (*Josh 23:12-13*), but God is able to work through human sinfulness.\n\n
14:3	idm30100					 The epithet **pagan** (literally *uncircumcised*) was regularly applied to Philistines, who, unlike many nations in the Middle East, did not practice any form of circumcision.\n\n
14:5	idm30108					 Samson was first explicitly empowered by **the Spirit** (cp. *13:25*) when he was **attacked** by a **lion**.\n\n
14:11	idm30118					 The reason for **thirty . . . companions** is not clear (cp. *2 Sam 23:13*). *Companions*, a word that normally means “friends,” may lend a touch of irony here (*Judg 14:12-20*).\n\n
14:12	idm30128					 Riddles were common tests of skill or a form of entertainment that usually employed double meanings. Despite some evidence for bees building hives in the bodies of dead animals, there was no apparent way to crack the mystery apart from knowing what Samson knew.\n\n
14:14	idm30134					 Israel’s hero, like Sisera, was defeated by a woman (*4:21*; see *study note on 8:20-21*).\n\n
14:18	idm30142					 It was common to answer a riddle with another riddle. In this case, the Philistines used a similar poetic couplet, not to reveal all they knew, but simply to win the contest.\n\n
14:19	idm30148					 **Samson** kept his side of the deal (cp. *1 Sam 18:20-27*). He apparently returned home without consummating his marriage, which traditionally would have happened at the end of the seven days of feasting.\n\n
14:20	idm30156					 According to some ancient customs, giving the bride to the **best man**, even if the marriage was not consummated, was forbidden. The father’s action appears to have been treacherous (cp. *15:2-3*, *6*).\n\n
15:1	idm30165					 **Wheat harvest** came at the end of May; how long this was after the wedding feast is not known. There was some precedent for a bride’s remaining in her parents’ home for a few months before moving to the groom’s home, while allowing conjugal visits.\n\n
15:2	idm30172					 The **father** may have thought that his daughter had been abandoned (see *study note on 14:20*). The father’s offer of the **younger sister** might have been an attempt to remedy his own treachery.\n\n
15:3	idm30181					 In revenge, Samson devastated the harvest of **grain***,* wine (**vineyards**), and cooking oil (**olive groves**).\n\n
15:6	idm30191					 The chain of revenge was complicated (cp. *9:7-21*). First, **Samson** took revenge on the community of Philistines, not on his in-laws. Next, **the Philistines** accepted that Samson was a victim of injustice (see *study note on 14:20*) and took revenge on Samson’s in-laws, which then led Samson to avenge his in-laws by attacking the Philistines. It all triggered a potential war with Israel. God was beginning to rescue Israel through Samson (*13:5*; cp. *1 Sam 7:3*).\n\n
15:11	idm30203					 Completely missing what might have been a divine opportunity to throw off Philistine oppression, the tribe of **Judah** showed itself ready to continue living under foreign occupation. We can only wonder what might have happened if the Judeans had been fully committed to the Lord’s covenant, which provided for them to take the land and drive out the inhabitants (see *study note on 1:1*).\n\n
15:12	idm30211					 **promise that you won’t kill me:** Samson’s superhuman abilities might have been limited to use against the enemies of Israel; he broke these ropes only after the Spirit of the Lord came upon him (*15:14*).\n\n
15:13	idm30219					 **New ropes** were stronger, more pliable, and less brittle than older ones.\n\n
15:14	idm30226					 Both Samson and the Judeans seem to have been satisfied with this relatively small victory and did not follow up by overthrowing Philistine oppression. This failure reflects Israel’s declining confidence in God’s promises.\n\n
15:16	idm30232					 Like other warrior-heroes (e.g., Moses, Deborah, and David), Samson celebrated his victory in poetry, a short couplet that combines colorful speech with wordplay. “Lehi” (*15:9*) and **jawbone** are the same Hebrew word (*lekhi*), as are **heaps** and **donkey** (Hebrew *khamor*). • **piled them in heaps!** Or *made donkeys of them.*\n\n
15:18	idm30246					 Samson **cried out to the** Lord, as he feared dying of **thirst** and falling prey to the defeated **pagans** (literally *uncircumcised ones;* see *study note on 14:3*). Samson twice prayed deep and passionate prayers, once when he feared being attacked, and once when he was attacking others (*16:28-30*).\n\n
15:20	idm30259					 Though this summary formula is repeated in *16:31*, its occurrence here indicates that Samson’s period as judge was effectively over (cp. *10:2*, *3*; *12:7*). He had done little more than show Israel the potential of rescue; **the Philistines** still **dominated the land.**\n\n
16:1	idm30271					 There is nothing of judgeship in this last chapter of Samson’s checkered history. Samson effectively abandoned his calling and was eventually stripped of his gifting as well. Only in his final encounter, when he again turned to the Lord in prayer, did any of his heroic stature revive.\n\n
16:2	idm30277					 City **gates** of the period were locked **during the night** to prevent passage in or out, and the men of the city, having seen the gates locked, probably slept (**kept quiet**) in one of the gate houses, thinking that they could resume their vigil in the morning.\n\n
16:3	idm30286					 Samson had to pick up the entire six- to twelve-foot-wide **gate** system and take it to the hills **across from Hebron**, a town about forty miles distant. Samson humiliated the Philistines but did nothing to defeat them.\n\n
16:4	idm30294					 Samson’s dissipation and defeat by **Delilah** the temptress has the universal appeal of great tragedy.\n\n
16:5	idm30301					 The Philistine rulers knew that direct confrontation with Samson would not succeed, so they resorted to subterfuge. The generous offer by the **rulers** (literally *lords*) of the five Philistine cities (*3:3*) shows how seriously the Philistines took this matter.\n\n
16:6	idm30310					 The desire for silver rather than self-preservation (cp. *14:15*) seems to have motivated Delilah; she apparently did not reciprocate Samson’s love.\n\n
16:7	idm30317					 **Bowstrings** were commonly made of dried animal tendons or gut. **Seven** was a symbolic number, perhaps connected with the Philistines’ sense of magical power. Samson seems more at home in a Philistine cultural setting than in keeping his Israelite vows that bound him as a Nazirite.\n\n
16:11	idm30325					 **Brand-new ropes** had already been tried (*15:13-14*).\n\n
16:13	idm30333					 Possibly Samson’s hair was woven into the fabric as weft on the loom’s warp, which was then tightened as in normal weaving.\n\n
16:16	idm30339					 Samson should have recognized his danger (cp. *14:17*), but spiritual blindness had led to mental exhaustion.\n\n
16:17	idm30346					 Samson’s **hair** was the sign of his vow to the Lord; when his hair was shorn, his vow would be broken. The **seven** braided **locks** were only a sign; the Lord’s presence was the reality behind **his strength**.\n\n
16:18	idm30356					 After being fooled three times, the **rulers** had given up and left. Now, however, they **returned with the money in their hands**—they knew that this was the moment they had dreamed of.\n\n
16:20	idm30364					 Like the remorseful but presumptuous earlier Israelites (*Num 14:40-45*), Samson **didn’t realize** that his hair was gone and that the divine presence had departed (cp. *Hos 7:9*).\n\n
16:22	idm30373					 There was no certainty that the Lord would revive Samson’s strength when **his hair began to grow back***;* there was only the hope that the Lord’s earlier promise—that he would begin to rescue Israel through this strange and now broken hero—still stood.\n\n
16:23	idm30381					 In their boundless rejoicing, the Philistines gave all the credit to **their god, Dagon**. In the pagan mind, the relative strength of nations reflected the power of their gods.\n\n
16:28	idm30388					 Though only for personal revenge, **Samson** furthered God’s purpose of rescuing his people.\n\n
17:1	idm30395					 These two epilogues (chs *17–18* and chs *19–21*) attest that inspired but unstructured leadership cannot endure. During the relentless march toward social disintegration and civil war, the refrain, “In those days Israel had no king,” occurs four times, and “all the people did whatever seemed right in their own eyes” is added twice (*17:6*; *18:1*; *19:1*; *21:25*). The era of inspired leadership spiraled downward and culminated in chaos. Something was clearly missing.\n\n
17:1	idm30407					 **Micah** is the short form of a name that means “Who is like the Lord?” The name highlights the contrast between the Lord and a carved image or cast idol. • **The hill country of Ephraim** was a natural gathering place in central Israel (*17:7-8*; *18:2*, *13*; *19:1*, *16*).\n\n
17:2	idm30421					 Micah’s **mother** was indulgent and idolatrous, yet she invoked the Lord’s name in both cursing and blessing. • **I heard you place a curse:** The words uttered in curses and blessings were understood to have power, particularly if the speaker had the authority to utter such pronouncements (cp. *Gen 27*; *Isa 55:11*). • **1,100 pieces:** This same large number was given to Delilah (*Judg 16:5*). It was probably Micah’s mother’s life savings or dowry. • **The** Lord** bless you:** Micah’s mother was hoping that the blessing would effectively neutralize her earlier curse.\n\n
17:4	idm30436					 We are not told what Micah’s **mother** did with the other 900 shekels. Perhaps they went to pay for the **shrine** (literally *house of gods*).\n\n
17:5	idm30445					 **ephod:** See *study note on 8:27*. • **household idols:** Cp. *Gen 31:19-32*; *2 Kgs 23:24*; *Zech 10:2*. The Bible mocks the inabilities of these personal deities. Micah’s installing **one of his sons as his personal priest** was triply irregular: The father was meant to be the religious head of the household (*Deut 6:7*; *Job 1:5*), only descendants of Aaron were to be priests (*Exod 28:1–29:37*; *30:30-33*; *40:12-15*), and priests were for the whole community of Israel, not for individuals or families.\n\n
17:7	idm30463					 Not much about this **Levite** fits into orthodox biblical categories. Some Levites were priests, while others were temple servants (cp. *Num 3–4*). Levites were scattered throughout Israel (*Gen 49:5-7*; *Josh 21*). This young man, apparently a descendant of Gershom (*Judg 18:30*; cp. *Exod 2:21-22*), was based in Judah, but not in a Levitical town, and was looking for **another place to live**.\n\n
17:13	idm30476					 The contract **priest**, in Micah’s view, conferred some additional legitimacy on the shrine, though his expectation that **the** Lord would **bless** him was based on superstition rather than obedience to the Lord. Micah’s abandonment of God’s covenant would bring a curse on him that no unemployed **Levite** could ward off. Micah was not the last Israelite to seek out a priest or Levite in an attempt to legitimize irregular religious practices (cp. *1 Kgs 12:28-31*; *2 Kgs 16:10-18*).\n\n
18:1	idm30489					 The migration of the Danites (cp. *Josh 19:40-48*) is the story of that tribe’s failure to obey God’s covenant, and it is indicative of Israel’s decline. What began as Micah’s private heresy (*Judg 17:4-5*) would become the apostasy of an entire tribe (*18:30-31*). What began as covenant failure (*1:19-36*) turned into social breakdown in the days of Jephthah and Samson (chs *11–16*). In the end, law and order were replaced by banditry and pillaging (*18:27-28*).\n\n
18:2	idm30501					 **Zorah and Eshtaol:** Scouts were selected from the area where the Spirit of the Lord began to stir Samson (*13:25*). The mention of the two towns is a grim reminder that what began with Samson had not been completed, either by his own tribe (Dan) or by their powerful neighbor (Judah). These **capable warriors**, rather than fighting the Lord’s battles, bullied their fellow Israelites (*18:24-25*) and attacked a defenseless city (*18:27*; cp. *Gen 49:17*).\n\n
18:3	idm30513					 The Danites either **recognized the young Levite’s accent** (literally *voice*) as belonging to the region of Judah (*17:7*) or recognized his voice because they had known him personally. Their line of questioning went beyond simply establishing his credentials to providing them with a bit of divine guidance (*18:5*). His reply (*18:6*) established his willingness to be a mercenary priest.\n\n
18:5	idm30524					 **The** Lord had already promised to give Dan an allotment in the southwest that they had failed to possess (see *1:34*; *Josh 19:40-48*). Now they were asking God’s blessing from a hired priest whose “blessing,” like that of Micah’s mother (*Judg 17:2*), sounded religious while having no basis in Israel’s covenant with the Lord.\n\n
18:7	idm30535					 **Laish** has been extensively excavated and was an impressive city at this time. The description of Laish and its relationship to the port of **Sidon** is not entirely clear in the text or from recorded history. The people of Laish, as Phoenicians, might have expected to be exempt from Israel’s attack on the Canaanites. This language is substantially repeated in *18:28*.\n\n
18:9	idm30544					 The language resembles the report following the mission to spy out the land (*Num 14:7-8*; *Deut 1:25*), but the context is sharply different. Joshua and Caleb overcame their fear and acted in faith by remembering the Lord’s promise (cp. *Josh 2:9*, *24*; *6:2*; *10:19*, *30*). The Danite warriors invoked God’s blessing and recognized the value of the land, but their cocky self-assurance contrasts sharply with the godly faith of Joshua and Caleb.\n\n
18:12	idm30557					 **Kiriath-jearim:** In this town northwest of Jerusalem the Ark rested for twenty years (*1 Sam 7:1-2*) on its return from Philistine captivity. It lay on the border of Judah and Benjamin and was given a memorial name associated with Dan’s wanderings (cp. the different site of *Judg 13:25*).\n\n
18:14	idm30566					 The perfidy and insincerity of this exchange expose the ignoble values of all concerned.\n\n
18:14	idm30572					 **sacred ephod . . . household idols . . . carved image . . . cast idol:** See *study notes on 8:27* and *17:5*.\n\n
18:15	idm30581					 Bypassing the host, the five unscrupulous scouts went straight to their target, the naive and unprincipled **young Levite**.\n\n
18:16	idm30588					 The **600 armed warriors** were prepared to attack the single Levite. In contrast to Gideon’s army of 300 arrayed against the Midianite hordes (*7:2-11*), the Danites were merely armed bullies.\n\n
18:18	idm30596					 The priest’s rhetorical question was less an attempt to stop the theft than an expression of concern about his own future (cp. *18:20*).\n\n
18:19	idm30603					 Using Micah’s language (**be a father and priest**, *17:10*), but without its generosity, the Danites’ question was moot in light of the 600 men standing at the door.\n\n
18:20	idm30611					 **The young priest** was receptive to the offer; ignoring his generous benefactor, he joined in absconding with Micah’s prized objects. The blessing of Micah’s mother (*17:3*) was becoming ever more tarnished.\n\n
18:22	idm30619					 Some of Micah’s neighbors had apparently become converts to the cult of his shrine.\n\n
18:23	idm30625					 The question was only intended to cow Micah into abandoning the fight.\n\n
18:24	idm30631					 Micah’s last speech is pathetic and pitiful. He began by stealing from his own mother and ended by losing it all to worse thieves than himself. The narrative drips with irony, including Micah’s loss of **the gods I have made**. His fate was that of all who forsake the Lord’s covenant: **I have nothing left!**\n\n
18:25	idm30639					 **short-tempered** (literally *bitter of soul;* “in deep anguish,” *1 Sam 1:10*; “discontented,” *1 Sam 22:2*; “enraged,” *2 Sam 17:8*): This term describes those whose bitter disappointment with life has made their actions unpredictable.\n\n
18:28	idm30650					 **Beth-rehob** was perhaps an Aramean kingdom to the north (*2 Sam 10:6*). Nothing heroic, and no holy war, accrued to these Danite warriors who captured this defenseless city. Dan fulfilled Jacob’s mixed blessing by turning from the high calling of governing his people (*Gen 49:16*) to becoming “a snake beside the road, a poisonous viper along the path that bites the horse’s hooves so its rider is thrown off” (*Gen 49:17*).\n\n
18:29	idm30660					 The city of **Dan** became the northernmost landmark of Israel’s territory (e.g., *20:1*; *2 Sam 3:10*; *1 Kgs 4:25*; *2 Chr 30:5*). Its identity as a center of idolatry continued throughout its history (see *1 Kgs 12:28-30*; *Amos 8:14*).\n\n
18:30	idm30673					 The wandering Levite is now called **Jonathan**; he was a descendant of **Moses** through **Gershom** (*Exod 2:21-22*). • **The Exile** is traditionally understood to have begun with the fall of the northern kingdom in 722 BC. In light of the reference to Shiloh (*Judg 18:31*), the exile of the Ark from Shiloh (*1 Sam 4–6*) might be in view.\n\n
18:31	idm30687					 The religious infidelity of **the tribe of Dan** continued at least through the period of the judges; whether it was corrected by Samuel, Saul, or David is nowhere stated. • Joshua took **Shiloh**, a town in the hill country of Ephraim, as his command post and central shrine (*Josh 18:1*) during the conquest and distribution of the land (*Josh 18–22*). The priest Eli and his sons ministered before the Lord at Shiloh (*1 Sam 1:3*). The town and sanctuary were probably destroyed by Philistines about 1050 BC (see *1 Sam 4:1-11*). Shiloh was later remembered as an example of God’s judgment on false worship conducted in his name (see *Jer 7:12-14*; *26:6*; cp. *Ps 78:60*).\n\n
19:1	idm30703					 This second epilogue (see *study note on 17:1–21:25*) shifts the focus from individuals to whole tribes. Beginning with the outrage in the Benjamite town of Gibeah (ch *19*), which led to civil war (ch *20*) and the decimation of Benjamin, and moving on to the attempt to rescue the tribe from oblivion (ch *21*), the book concludes with the now-familiar refrain, **in those days Israel had no king; all the people did whatever seemed right in their own eyes**. This was perhaps the low point in Israel’s own remembered history; this is “what they did in Gibeah” that Hosea, 400 years later, would liken to the depths to which Ephraim had sunk (*Hos 9:9*; *10:9*). • The way had been cleared for a transition from charismatic leadership to what might be called “covenant-charismatic kingship,” i.e., kingship that combined living under the Lord’s covenant (*Deut 17:14-20*) with the anointing of the Spirit for the task of ruling, as with Saul and David.\n\n
19:1	idm30717					 A **concubine** was a second-class wife. In a society where polygamy was common, a concubine could be purchased, acquired as repayment of debt, or taken in war. A concubine was sometimes added to make up for a deficiency in a legitimate wife (e.g., *Gen 16:1-4*; *30:3-13*; *35:22*), but in the case of the Levite there appears to have been no other wife.\n\n
19:4	idm30727					 The woman’s **father** demonstrated typical Near Eastern hospitality, in contrast to what would later transpire in Gibeah (*19:14-28*). The scene in Bethlehem offers reconciliation and the promise of a new beginning.\n\n
19:5	idm30735					 Although some have suggested that the delay in leaving was analogous to Samson’s seven-day bridal feast (*14:10-20*), the picture may reflect nothing more than the father’s reluctance to bid his daughter farewell.\n\n
19:10	idm30742					 **Jebus:** See *study note on 1:21*. The city’s old name and its foreign status in Israel persisted until its capture by David (*2 Sam 5:6-10*).\n\n
19:13	idm30751					 The two Benjamite towns of **Gibeah** and **Ramah** have a prominent place in Israelite history, connected as they are with judges (Deborah, *4:5*), priests (Eleazar, *Josh 24:33*), prophets (Samuel, *1 Sam 8:4*), and kings (Saul, *1 Sam 10:26*). The account of Gibeah’s noble history compounds the tragedy of the events that followed.\n\n
19:15	idm30763					 The normal rules of hospitality in Israel and the rest of the Near East obligated a citizen of the town to take them in (cp. *Isa 58:7*; *Luke 14:13-14*; *Rom 12:13*; *1 Tim 3:2*; *5:10*; *Heb 13:2*; *1 Pet 4:9*). The Levite had funds and provisions (*Judg 19:19*), so there was even less excuse. This erosion of common civility is yet another evidence of social dysfunction at the time of Judges.\n\n
19:16	idm30777					 The **old man** was **from the hill country of Ephraim** rather than the territory of Benjamin. The natives of Gibeah were all unwilling to help.\n\n
19:18	idm30785					 **now I’m returning home:** The Levite said nothing about his own status, or about why he was traveling.\n\n
19:20	idm30792					 The note of urgency in the old man’s response foreshadowed the coming trouble (cp. *Gen 19:2-3*).\n\n
19:22	idm30799					 **troublemakers:** Hebrew *sons of Belial;* see study notes on *1 Kgs 21:10*; *1 Sam 1:16*; *2 Cor 6:15*. Their goal was homosexual rape. Cp. *Gen 19:4-5*.\n\n
19:23	idm30811					 **For this man is a guest in my house:** It was **shameful** to be inhospitable to a visitor, but the **evil** demands of the crowd went beyond lack of hospitality. They intended violence against the visitor (see *20:5*).\n\n
19:24	idm30821					 The old man attempted to preserve the social obligation of hospitality at the cost of handing over the vulnerable to be harmed (cp. *Jas 1:27*). There is no way, for our age or theirs, to soften the horror of what followed. The period of the judges was coming to an end in deepest depravity. Something was fundamentally amiss.\n\n
19:25	idm30828					 Contrast the instruction to husbands in *Eph 5:25-28*.\n\n
19:28	idm30835					 The Levite’s actions exemplify the horror of a corrupt culture.\n\n
20:1	idm30841					 This was not the **Mizpah** east of the Jordan associated with Jephthah (*10:17*; *11:11*, *29*, *34*), but a place in central Israel. This common name means “watchtower.”\n\n
20:3	idm30852					 The tribe of **Benjamin** had probably received the summons (*19:29*), so they knew that trouble was brewing.\n\n
20:5	idm30860					 The “troublemakers” (*19:22*) were **leading citizens** (literally *lords*). • **planning to kill me:** The death of his concubine convinced the Levite that the men of Gibeah intended his death.\n\n
20:9	idm30870					 The **lots** may have been the Urim and Thummim on the priest’s breastplate (*Exod 28:30*; cp. *Josh 14:2*; *1 Sam 14:41*; *Ezra 2:63*).\n\n
20:12	idm30881					 Israel recognized corporate responsibility. The leading citizens of **Gibeah** were guilty (*20:5*), and all of Gibeah became an accessory to their crimes by failing to discipline them. **The tribe of Benjamin**, in turn, had a responsibility to bring **Gibeah** to justice; failing that, they all shared the guilt. Had Israel not done something about Benjamin’s sin, the guilt would then have extended to the entire nation.\n\n
20:13	idm30891					 Benjamin’s response was consistent with its independent and warlike character (cp. *Gen 49:27*). The tribe had justifiable confidence in the warriors for which it was famous (*Judg 3:12-30*; *1 Chr 12:2*). Though outnumbered almost three to one, they defeated the rest of Israel twice and inflicted heavy casualties (*Judg 20:18-24*).\n\n
20:16	idm30901					 **left-handed:** See *study note on 3:15*. • The **sling** was of the same type as the one David used to kill Goliath (*1 Sam 17:40-51*). The slinger buried a stone in a small pouch attached to a leather thong, then swung it around his head to gain momentum before releasing one end of the thong to shoot the missile. A slinger had the advantage of distance over a swordsman.\n\n
20:18	idm30911					 To **go first** means to lead, not necessarily to precede (*Gen 49:10*).\n\n
20:19	idm30919					 The three battles took place around the guilty city. Despite superior numbers and having asked the Lord for guidance, the Israelite troops facing the defenders behind their walls were soundly beaten back the first day.\n\n
20:22	idm30925					 Following a time of weeping and probably confession (cp. *Josh 7*) the Israelite troops received divine guidance and regained confidence.\n\n
20:24	idm30932					 A second debacle shook the confidence of the Israelites (*20:26-28*).\n\n
20:26	idm30939					 The pressure was building to admit defeat and go home. The activities **in the presence of the** Lord increased in intensity as the Israelites sought the Lord’s direction.\n\n
20:29	idm30947					 The third day’s battle followed the same strategies of deception and ambush that were used to conquer Ai (*Josh 8:1-29*).\n\n
20:33	idm30954					 **Baal-tamar** is an unidentified town.\n\n
20:36	idm30961					 This section gives a second account of the battle.\n\n
20:43	idm30967					 **finally overtaking them east of Gibeah:** The geography is complicated, with a further problem of possible confusion between *Gibeah* and nearby *Geba* (*1 Sam 13:3–14:5*; see also *1 Kgs 15:22*).\n\n
20:47	idm30978					 **the rock of Rimmon:** “Rimmon” was a Benjamite personal name (*2 Sam 4:2*), and the place was about four miles east of Bethel. It was a stronghold, probably a cliff dwelling that protected fugitives by its inaccessibility.\n\n
21:1	idm30986					 For the second time in Judges, an unwise vow put its makers in a difficult position (see *study note on 11:31*).\n\n
21:3	idm30993					 The concept of a twelve-tribe league was deeply rooted in Israel, having survived the separation of Levi from the secular tribes, the virtual disappearance of Simeon and Asher, and the division of Joseph into two (Manasseh and Ephraim). The loss of one tribe would have suggested that God’s covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob was coming unglued.\n\n
21:8	idm30999					 **Jabesh-gilead** was an important town east of the Jordan whose failure to participate in the war against Benjamin made a grievous break in solidarity (see *21:5*).\n\n
21:11	idm31007					 **Completely destroy:** See *Lev 27:28-29*.\n\n
21:15	idm31015					 **The people felt sorry for Benjamin:** Israel was concerned about the brokenness of the nation. • The **gap** in Israel was an act of **the** Lord, because the war against Benjamin had been a response to the Lord’s covenant.\n\n
21:19	idm31025					 The **annual** grape harvest **festival . . . in Shiloh** may originally have been a Canaanite feast.\n\n
21:23	idm31033					 **Their own land** was the land allotted to the tribe of Benjamin by the Lord’s covenant (*2:6*).\n\n
21:24	idm31041					 **The people of Israel** pulled through despite the lack of inspired leadership (chs *17–18*) and the failure of the tribal league (chs *19–21*). **Tribes and families** were intact; Israel and all its tribes would survive.\n\n
21:25	idm31051					 The conclusion of chs *17–21* gives the reason for the social disorder of the time. Following the period of the judges, God would make a new covenant with Israel involving King David (*2 Sam 7*) and the promise of messianic rule. The fulfillment of that promise would go far beyond anything that could be imagined in the time when **Israel had no king**.\n\n
