1:1	idm170077					 In a typical letter opening, Jude identifies himself and his audience and prays for them. • **keeps you safe in the care of Jesus Christ:** This description introduces an important emphasis (see also *1:21*, *24*) and gives assurance in the context of false teaching.\n\n
1:1	idm170086					 **Jude** (or *Judas*) is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name “Judah.” It was a common name; this Jude was **a brother of James***,* who was a brother of Jesus (see *Jude Book Introduction*, “Author”). • **a slave of Jesus Christ:** Jude acknowledges that he is under Jesus’ lordship in every area of life. The title also carries honor: The great Old Testament leaders of God’s people were also called *slaves* or *servants* of God (see *Josh 14:7*; *2 Kgs 18:12*; *Ezek 34:23*). • **to all who have been called:** It is unclear who the specific recipients of Jude’s letter were.\n\n
1:3	idm170104					 In place of the thanksgiving that usually comes at this point in a New Testament letter (see *Rom 1:8-14*; *1 Cor 1:4-9*), Jude explains his central purpose. False teaching was a potent danger to the faith of his readers (see *Jude 1:22-23*).\n\n
1:3	idm170113					 In the New Testament, “faith” usually refers to the act of believing, while **the faith** refers to the content of Christian belief.\n\n
1:4	idm170120					 Abusing **God’s marvelous grace** by saying that it **allows us to live immoral lives** is a constant temptation (cp. *Rom 6*).\n\n
1:5	idm170129					 This section elaborates on the “condemnation recorded long ago” (*1:4*) by applying to the false teachers Old Testament examples of God’s judgment.\n\n
1:5	idm170136					 The preexistent **Jesus** rescued the people of Israel from Egypt and later destroyed the unfaithful (cp. *1 Cor 10:4*). • After rescuing **the nation of Israel from Egypt***,* God led them toward the Promised Land. Most of the people did not trust the Lord to protect them. Because of their unbelief, God sentenced that generation (except Joshua and Caleb) to wander in the wilderness until they died (see *Num 14*).\n\n
1:6	idm170147					 **The angels** might refer to the fall of Satan and his angelic followers, but no Old Testament passage clearly describes this event (see study notes on *Isa 14:12-17*; *Ezek 28:12-19*). Jude was probably referring to *Gen 6:1-4*; Jewish tradition understood the “sons of God” in *Gen 6* to be wicked angels and viewed their intercourse with women as the cause of their **judgment** (see *1 Enoch* 6–10; see also study notes on *1 Pet 3:19-20*; *2 Pet 2:4*). Jude later (*Jude 1:14-15*) quotes directly from *1 Enoch*.\n\n
1:7	idm170164					 God’s judgment on **Sodom and Gomorrah** had become proverbial (see *Gen 18:17–19:26*; *Luke 17:26-29*). • **neighboring towns:** *Deuteronomy 29:23* mentions Admah and Zeboiim. • **Every kind of sexual perversion** probably refers to homosexuality (*Gen 19:5-10*).\n\n
1:8	idm170177					 **supernatural beings:** Literally *glorious ones,* which are probably evil angels. In the Old Testament and in Judaism, angels were given a prominent role in the judgment. The false teachers might have been downplaying the reality of a judgment to come (see *1:18*; *2 Pet 3:3-4*) or denying the glorious origin of these fallen angels (cp. *2 Pet 2:10*).\n\n
1:9	idm170188					 **Michael, one of the mightiest of the angels:** In Jewish tradition, “archangel” was the highest rank of angel (see also *1 Thes 4:16*). Michael is mentioned several other times in Scripture (*Dan 10:13*, *21*; *12:1*; *Rev 12:7*); the story about him fighting with **the devil about Moses’ body** is not in the Old Testament but is preserved in Jewish tradition (see *Assumption of Moses*).\n\n
1:11	idm170202					 **Cain:** See *Gen 4:1-16*. • **Balaam:** See *study note on 2 Pet 2:15*. • **Korah:** See *Num 16:1-35*.\n\n
1:12	idm170214					 The early Christians celebrated the Lord’s Supper as part of shared **fellowship meals** with one another.\n\n
1:13	idm170221					 The planets were considered to be **wandering stars** because they moved across the sky in seemingly irregular patterns. The false teachers wandered, and God condemned their sin.\n\n
1:14	idm170228					 **Enoch** was an early descendant of Adam (see *Gen 5:18-24*; *1 Chr 1:3*); the comment in *Gen 5:24* apparently means that Enoch did not die but was taken directly to heaven (cp. *2 Kgs 2:1-13*; see *Heb 11:5*). This extraordinary commendation from God and the almost complete silence of Scripture about him make Enoch a fascinating character. There are a number of legends about him in Jewish literature, and at least two books of apocalyptic visions written between the Old Testament and the New Testament are attributed to him (*1–2 Enoch*).\n\n
1:17	idm170241					 After condemning the false teachers, Jude again encourages his readers directly (see *1:3-4*). They had been warned by the apostles about false teaching (*1:17-19*). They should encourage each other in the faith (*1:20-21*) and reach out to those who might be going astray through the false teachers’ influence (*1:22-23*).\n\n
1:17	idm170251					 **what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ predicted:** Such predictions are in *Acts 20:29-30*; *1 Tim 4:1-3*; *2 Tim 3:1-5*.\n\n
1:18	idm170261					 **in the last times:** The coming of Jesus as Messiah inaugurated the last stage of God’s plan, when the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the last days began to take place. For this reason, Jude applies the apostles’ prophecy about the last times to the immediate crisis created by the false teachers (*1:19*).\n\n
1:20	idm170269					 **your most holy faith:** As in *1:3*, *faith* refers to what Christians believe, the doctrinal and ethical core of Christian identity, which false teachers threaten. Believers must therefore devote themselves to it.\n\n
1:22	idm170278					 The NLT accepts the manuscript tradition that includes three commands in these verses, corresponding to three categories of people: (1) those whose faith is wavering, (2) those who need to be snatched from the flames of judgment, and (3) others who need to be shown mercy. Some manuscripts have only two categories of people: (1) those whose faith is wavering and thus need to be snatched from judgment, and (2) those who need to be shown mercy. The text adopted in the NLT follows the pattern of threes that Jude uses elsewhere (*1:5-7*, *11*).\n\n
1:22	idm170286					 **those whose faith is wavering:** Some believers were in the early stages of doubt because of what the false teachers were saying.\n\n
1:23	idm170293					 **Rescue others:** Some believers were so open to the false teachers that they were in imminent danger of condemnation. • **Show mercy to still others:** The third group probably consists of the false teachers themselves or those who had subscribed to the false teachers’ program. Showing mercy might have meant praying for them (cp. *Matt 5:44*). • Believers need to exercise **great caution** when showing mercy to false teachers and those who have fallen into their sinful ways, because their sins can be enticing. Cp. *Zech 3:1-4*; *Rev 3:4*.\n\n
1:24	idm170305					 Jude concludes his letter with one of the most stirring doxologies in Scripture, and one quoted very often in liturgical settings. Jude’s wording makes it especially appropriate for his readers: They needed a renewed vision of God who could **keep** them **from falling away***,* from succumbing to the enticing doctrine of false teachers. He has the **glory, majesty, power, and authority** to bring them safely into his glorious presence forever.\n\n
